An alarm? But I'm still sleepy. I was in the zone drawing last night and
didn't get to bed until it was almost dawn.
"...ki... Taki."
Now somebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.A girl?
"Taki, Taki."
Her voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
"Don't you remember me?" the voice asks me anxiously.
No, I don't know you.
Suddenly, the train stops, and the doors open. Oh, right—I was on a train.
The moment I realize this, I'm standing in a packed train car. A pair of wide
eyes hovers right in front of me. A girl in a uniform is staring straight at me, but
the press of disembarking passengers is pushing her farther away.
"My name is Mitsuha!"
The girl shouts, undoing the cord she'd used to tie back her hair and holding
it out to me. Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray
of evening sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that
color tight.
At that point, my eyes open.
The girl's voice—its echoes—still whispers in my ears.
.. .Her name is Mitsuha?
I don't know the name, and I don't know the girl. She looked really
desperate somehow. Her eyes were brimming with tears. I'd never seen the
style of uniform she was wearing. Her expression was serious, even grave, as
if the fate of the universe rested in her hands.
Still, it was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. By the time I think about
it, I can't even remember her face. The echoes in my ears are already gone,

Even so, my pulse is still racing abnormally fast. My chest is weirdly
heavy. I'm sweaty all over. For the moment, I draw a deep breath.
Haaaah...
Do I have a cold? My nose and throat feel funny. My airways are a little
tighter than usual. My chest...really is weirdly heavy. How do I put this?
Physically heavy. I look down at my body and see cleavage.
Cleavage.
The soft mounds reflect the morning sun, and the pale, smooth skin gleams.
A deep-blue shadow lies between the two breasts, like a lake.
Might as well squeeze 'em , I think, without missing a beat.
My hands gravitate toward them as naturally as an apple falling to the
ground.
. ?
...!
The sensation blows my mind. Whoa, I think. What is this? I keep kneading
earnestly. This is just... Wow... Girls' bodies are amazing...
"Sis? What're you doin'?"
I glance in the direction of the voice. There's a little girl standing there.
She's just opened a sliding door. With my hands still pressed against my chest,
I give her my honest impression.
"I was just thinking these feel way real... Huh?"
I look at the kid again. She's about ten, with twin ponytails and sharp eyes,
and she looks like the sassy type.
.. 'Sis'?" I ask the girl, pointing at myself.
So that means this is my kid sister? The girl looks thoroughly appalled.
"You still asleep or somethin'? It's. Break. Fast. Time! Hurry up!"
She slams the sliding door shut with a sharp thwack. Fierce little girl, I
think, hauling myself off the futon. Come to think of it, I am hungry. Suddenly, a
full-length mirror in the corner of my vision catches my eye. I walk a few steps
across the tatami mats decorating the floor to stand in front of it. Letting my
loose nightshirt slip off my shoulders and fall to the floor leaves me naked. I
stare at my full-length reflection in the mirror.
Long black hair flows down my back, although it's sleep-tousled and
sticking up in places. A small, round face holds big, curious eyes and lips that
seem vaguely amused above a slim neck, deep collarbone, and a swelling
bosom that seems to proclaim, Why yes, thank you, Fm quite healthy! Below
are faint shadows of ribs, and then the soft curves of the waist.
I haven't seen one in the flesh yet, but this is definitely a girl's body.
...A girl?
I'm...a girl?
Abruptly, the drowsy fog enveloping my body is gone. My head clears
instantly, then plunges into confusion.

"Sis, you're so late!"
As I open the sliding door and step into the living room, Yotsuha's
accusation flies to greet me.
"I'll fix breakfast tomorrow!" I say by way of apology.
This kid hasn't even lost all her baby teeth yet, but she seems convinced
she's handling life better than her big sister. I can't show weakness by
apologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white
helping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.
"Thanks for the food!"
I pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,
and put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel
eyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.
"So you're normal today, are you?"
"Huh?"
Gran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.
"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!" Yotsuha smirks at me. "Screamin'
all of a sudden like that."
Screaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,
I'm sure).
"Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!"
Seriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.
Ding-dong-ding-do oong.
Suddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.
"Good morning, everyone."
The voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the
Regional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a
dinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either
know each other or at least know someone in common.
"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori."
The slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. "Here
are...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori." There are speakers
outside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and
overlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.
Twice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast
plays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the
daily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how
to contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,
today's funerals.
"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on
the twentieth of next month, the town election management committee
has—"
Click.
The speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's
pulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but
even so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by
her chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.
Picking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts
speaking.
"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only
once every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be
visible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the
corner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation
to study it."
There's a line of text on the screen —Comet Tiamat visible to the naked
eye next month —and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its
momentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and
the NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like
whispered chatter during class.
"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?"
Out of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.
"It's an adult problem," I snap at her.
That's right—this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the
wind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.
Saying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.`,length:3650,num_lines:65,location:"Itomori",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Family Dynamics",role:"Explores the relationship between siblings and their interactions.",importance:.9,emotion:"Frustration and camaraderie",sentiment:.5,quote:"This kid hasn't even lost all her baby teeth yet, but she seems convinced she's handling life better than her big sister.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Community Connection",role:"Highlights the small-town atmosphere and shared experiences.",importance:.7,emotion:"Nostalgia and familiarity",sentiment:.6,quote:"This place, Itomori, is a dinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either know each other or at least know someone in common.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Adult Responsibilities",role:"Reflects on the burdens and complexities of adult issues.",importance:.8,emotion:"Frustration and resignation",sentiment:-.3,quote:"It's an adult problem.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Celestial Events",role:"Symbolizes hope and wonder amidst daily life.",importance:.6,emotion:"Excitement and anticipation",sentiment:.7,quote:"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only once every twelve hundred years.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:3,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:7},{title:"School Day Begins",summary:"Taki heads to school and encounters classmates.",chapter:"Chapter Two The Beginning",first_line:141,last_line:240,text:`The summer copper pheasants are crowing up a storm.
Traveling down the narrow paved path that runs along the hillside and
descending several stone-walled stairways, we emerge from the shadow of the
mountain into direct sunlight. Below us is a round lake, Itomori Lake. Its calm
surface reflects the morning sun, glittering and glaring as though nobody's
watching. The deep-green mountains form their ranks under white clouds in a
blue sky, and a little girl with pigtails and a red school backpack skips along
for no reason. Then there's me beside her, the dazzling, bare-legged high
school girl. In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as
background music. Ooh, it's just like the opening of a Japanese film... In other
words, we live in the boonies—very Japanese and a few decades behind the
times.
"Miiitsuhaaa!"
After Yotsuha and I part ways in front of the elementary school, a voice
calls out from behind me. It's Tesshi, pedaling his bike and looking cranky,
with Saya seated primly on the bike rack and smiling.
"Hurry up and get off," Tesshi grumbles.
"I'm fine right here. Don't be stingy!"
"C'mon, you're heavy."
"And you're rude!"
This early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a
married couple in a comedy skit.
"You two get along so well."
"We do not!" they chorus.
They deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack
switches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a
good ten years—petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and
tall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look
like they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly
synced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.
"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today."
Saya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,
grinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied
together in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.
"Huh? What about my hair?"
Her comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in
the shuffle at breakfast. I did it "properly" today—does that mean it was weird
yesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking
concerned. "Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?"
"Exorcise?"
"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!"
".. .Excuse me?" I frown at the unexpected remark.
Saya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. "Would you quit blamin'
everythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.
Right?"
Stressed?
"Huh? Wait, hold it—what's all this about?"
Why is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't
remember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.
...Hmm?
Wait, was it really? Yesterday, I...
"—And most importantly!"
A deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.
On the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little
crowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal
parking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and
bolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit
jacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent—Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for
the mayoral election.
"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the
village restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we
be able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I
intend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it
through to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,
creating a local society in which everyone—from our children to our senior
citizens—can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my
resolve to make this vision my goal..."
It's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold—
this campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot
surrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd— "You know it's
gonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, " "It sounds like he s been
spreadin ' lots of cash around" —make my mood even darker.
"Hey, Miyamizu."
"...Mornin'."
Wonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.
Even in high school, they're part of the flashy "in-crowd," and they snark at us
—the "drones"—over every little thing.
"The mayor and the contractor," one of them says, shooting a deliberate
glance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next
to mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an
armband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.
The guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. "Their kids are all
buddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?"
This is so stupid. I don't even answer—I walk faster, trying to get out of
there. Tesshi's expressionless. Only Saya looks bothered and a bit flustered.
"Mitsuha!"
Suddenly, a loud voice booms out. Yeep! My breath catches in my throat. I
don't believe this. My dad lowered his mic midspeech to shout at me without
the aid of electronic amplification. The whole crowd turns to look at me.
"Mitsuha, straighten up!"
I turn beet red. It's so unfair that I almost start crying. I want to run, but I
desperately fight back the urge and stride away instead.
The crowd is whispering. "He's even tough on family."
"That's the mayor for you."
I hear my classmates snickering. "Ooh. Harsh."
"I kinda feel a little sorry for her."
This could not be worse.
The background music that was playing in my head a minute ago has
disappeared, and I remember that this town, without a soundtrack, is an
absolutely suffocating place.`,length:5827,num_lines:100,location:"Itomori",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Friendship",role:"Highlights the playful banter and camaraderie among friends.",importance:.9,emotion:"Light-hearted and playful",sentiment:.8,quote:"You two get along so well.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Community Pressure",role:"Illustrates the expectations and scrutiny from the community regarding family and social status.",importance:.9,emotion:"Overwhelmed and suffocated",sentiment:-.7,quote:"He's even tough on family.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Nostalgia",role:"Evokes a sense of longing for simpler times and childhood innocence.",importance:.7,emotion:"Sentimental and reflective",sentiment:.6,quote:"In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as background music.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4},{name:"Political Ambition",role:"Demonstrates the impact of local politics on personal lives and relationships.",importance:.8,emotion:"Disillusioned and frustrated",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the village restoration project!",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:4,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Classroom Confusion",summary:"Taki struggles with memory loss and classmates' comments.",chapter:"Chapter Two The Beginning",first_line:241,last_line:292,text:`With a sharp tak, tak, tak, the teacher writes a short poem on the blackboard.

"Tasokare , 'who goes there?' This is the origin of the term tasogare, or
twilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?"
Speaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big
letters on the blackboard.
"It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,
making it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that
isn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has
another name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had
other names."
Miss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just
shuffling around the same letters.
"'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl "
Somebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of
course, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was
little is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,
our classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school
like this.
"I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori
still use ancient Japanese words here and there."
"'Cause this here's the sticks," proclaims one of the boys, and people start
giggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to
ask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were
abandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly
pondering, I flip through my notebook, and then—on a page that should be
blank—I see something written in big letters:
Who are you?
...Huh?
What is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being
absorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my
notebook to anybody, either. What? "Who am I?" What's that supposed to
mean?
"...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!"
"Oh! Yes'm!" I stand up hastily.
"Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please," Miss Yuki tells me.
Scrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, "Good to see that you
remember your name today, Miss Miyamizu."
At that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is
going on?!
"You don't remember?"
"...No."
"For real?"
"Yes, for real," I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's
looking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.
".. .No, listen. Yesterday, you forgot where your desk and your locker were.
Your hair was all mussed and cowlicky, and you hadn't tied it back. You didn't

There was.. .an unfamiliar town somewhere?
A reflection in a mirror.. .a boy?
I try to retrace my memories. Piihyororooo. In the distance, a kite mocks
me. It's lunchtime, and we're chatting in a corner of the schoolyard, juice
boxes in hand.
"Umrn... It feels like I spent the whole day in this weird dream. Like...a
dream about somebody else's life? .. .Mm, I can't remember much of it..."
"I got it!"
Tesshi shouts all of a sudden, and I jump. He snatches up his half-read issue
of the occult magazine MU and shoves it under our noses, spit flying
enthusiastically.
"Memories of your past life! That's what that is! Yeah, I know you're gonna
say that ain't scientific, but if you put it another way and say your unconscious
mind got linked up with a multi verse based on Everett's many-worlds
interpretation—"
"You shut your piehole," Saya scolds him sharply.
"Hey! Were you the one who scribbled in my notebook?!" I erupt at almost
the same time.
"Huh? Scribbled?"
Oh, I guess not. Tesshi's not the type to pull a lame prank like that, and he
didn't have a motive, either.
"Um, nothin'. Never mind," I say, backing down.
"Say what? Whaddaya mean, 'scribbled'? Ami a suspect for somethin'?"
"I told you, forget it."
"Whoa, Mitsuha, you're so mean! Did you hear that, Saya? I've been
falsely accused! Framed! Call a prosecutor, gimme a prosecutor! Or wait,
maybe that's a lawyer. Hey, which one are you supposed to get for stuff like
this?"
"Anyway, Mitsuha, you really were kinda funny yesterday," Saya says,
grandly ignoring Tesshi's complaints. "Were you feelin' sick?"
"Hmm... That's so weird. Maybe I really am stressed..."
I think back on all the accounts I've gotten so far.
Tesshi's already absorbed in his magazine again, as if nothing ever
happened. That's one of his virtues, the way he just lets stuff go.
"That's gotta be it! You've had all kinds of stress lately!"
She's right. Even setting aside the election, that ritual's tonight! Why, oh
why, in this tiny little town, do I have to have a father who's the mayor and a
grandmother who's the chief Shinto priestess at the shrine? I bury my face in
my knees and heave a deep, deep sigh.
"Aaagh... I wanna hurry up and graduate and go to Tokyo. This town is too
cramped and too tight!"
Saya's nodding along: I know. I totally, totally get it! "My mom and my
sisters have all been in charge of the town broadcasts, one after another. Ever
since I was tiny, the neighborhood ladies have called me 'the little broadcast
girl,' you know?! And now I'm in the broadcastin' club for some reason! Even
I don't know what I want to do anymore!"
"Saya, once we graduate, let's get out and go to Tokyo together! Even when
we're grown up, in this town, we'll still be stuck with the school hierarchy!
We'll never be free of these moldy old traditions! C'mon, Tesshi, you're
cornin' with us, right?"
"Hmm?" Absently, Tesshi looks up from his magazine.
".. .Were you even listenin'?"
"Mm. I don't really, uh... I think I'll just live here for the rest of my life."
HAAAAAAAAH. Saya and I sigh again. This is why he isn't popular with
girls... Although it's not like I've ever had a boyfriend myself.
The wind whispers gently. When I turn to look after it, there's Itomori Lake
below us: placid, calm, and completely disinterested.
This town doesn't have a bookstore or a dentist. There's one train every
two hours, buses come through only twice each day, we don't get weather
reports for our area, and we're still a mosaic on the Google Maps satellite
photos. The convenience store closes at nine, and it sells things like vegetable
seeds and high-grade farming equipment.
On the way home from school, Saya and I are still in "griping about
Itomori" mode.
There are no big chains like McDonald's or MOS Burger, but we have two
sleazy "snackbars." There's no work, no girls come here to find husbands, and
the daylight hours are short. Gripe, gripe, gripe, gripe. Most of the time, we
actually find the town's sparse population refreshing. We're almost proud of it,
but today we despair in earnest.

"Geez, y'all!"
"What?" we ask crossly, and Tesshi gives a creepy grin.
"Forget about all that stuff. Wanna stop at the cafe?"
"Huh...?"
"Wha...?"
"Wha...?!"
"A cafe?!" we chorus in perfect unison.
A metallic kachonk! melts into the calls of the evening cicadas. "Here."
Tesshi holds out the cans of juice from the vending machine. With a motorized
whine, an old man riding his electric scooter home from the fields crosses in
front of us, and a passing stray dog sits down and yawns as if to say, Yeah, why
not? I'll keep you company.
The "cafe" wasn't exactly what springs to mind. It wasn't Starbucks or
Tully's or one of those fantastic, fabled spaces that serves pancakes and bagels
and gelato. It was just a neighborhood bus stop out in the middle of nowhere
with a vending machine and a bench with an ice-cream sign from about thirty
years ago plastered to it. The three of us sit side by side on the bench, sipping
our juice, while the dog rests at our feet. We don't feel like Tesshi tricked us.
It's more like, Well, sure. What else would it be?
"Okay, I'm headin' home."
I bid my farewells to the two of them after participating in an exchange I
could not have cared less about— "I think it's about a degree cooler than it
was yesterday. " "No, I think it's a degree warmer" —that lasted as long as it
took to finish a can of juice.
"Good luck tonight," says Saya.
"We'll come by and watch later," promises Tesshi.

Do your best to turn into an
actual couple, you two! After climbing the stone steps for a while, I turn back,
looking at the pair of them as they sit on the bench with the sunset-colored lake
in the background, and I softly layer a lyrical piano melody over the scene.
Mm-hmm, y'all really do look good together. Tonight, I must perform my awful
duty, but I hope you can enjoy your youth.
"Awww, I wanna do it, too," Yotsuha grumbles.
"It's too soon for you yet, Yotsuha," hushes Gran.
The constant click of spherical weights knocking together echoes in a
workroom big enough for only about eight tatami mats. "Listen to the voice of
the thread," Gran tells her. Even as she speaks, her hands don't pause in their
work. "If you keep windin' threads that way, before long, emotions will start
runnin' between you and the thread."
"Huh? But thread doesn't talk."
"Our braided cords—," Gran continues, ignoring Yotsuha's objection. All
three of us are wearing kimonos, and we're finishing up the cords that we'll
use in tonight's ceremony.
Braided cords are made of thin threads plaited together into a single rope.
It's a traditional folk art that's been handed down for a very long time. The
finished cords are cute and colorful, with all sorts of designs braided into
them. That said, the work takes quite a bit of skill, so Gran's making Yotsuha's
for her. Yotsuha's spending the time doing assistant work, winding thread
around the ball-weights.
"Our braided cords hold a thousand years of Itomori's history. I tell you,
that school of yours really should put priority on teachin' this sort of town
history to you children. Listen, two hundred years ago..."
Here we go again, I think with a wry little smile. It's Gran's favorite
speech, and I've heard it over and over in this workroom, ever since I was
small.
"A fire began in the bathroom of Mayugorou Yamazaki, the straw sandal-
maker, and it burned up this whole area, including the shrine and all the old
records. It was what people call—"
Gran glances at me.
"'The Great Mayugorou Fire,"' I answer smoothly.
Mm-hmm. Gran nods, looking satisfied.
"What? They named the fire after him?!" Yotsuha exclaims, startled. "Poor
Mr. Mayugorou," she mutters. "Havin' his name stick around 'cause of
somethin' like that."
"Thanks to that fire, we don't know what our dances or the patterns in our
cords mean anymore. All we have left are the forms. Still, even not knowin',
we mustn't ever let the forms disappear. The meanin' in those shapes is bound
to resurface someday."
Gran's words have a unique rhythm to them, like a traditional ballad, and as
I braid my cord, I mouth the words along with her, silently reciting them from
memory. The meanin ' in those shapes is bound to resurface someday. Here,
at Miyamizu Shrine —
"Here, at Miyamizu Shrine, that's our solemn duty. And yet..."
At that point, Gran lowers her mild eyes, sadly.
"And yet, that foolish son of mine... As if abandonin' the priesthood and
leavin' this house weren't enough, he had to become a politician..."
Gran sighs, and I sneak a small sigh of my own underneath it. Even I don't
really know whether I love this town or hate it, whether I want to go
somewhere far away or stay with my family and friends forever. When I
remove my finished, brightly colored cord from the round stand, it makes a
soft, lonely click.

It sets the mood for some sinister
event, like in an old murder mystery novel. For a little while now, I've been
performing a ceremonial shrine maiden dance, feeling gloomy enough that I
wish a killer like Jason or Jack the Ripper—anybody really—would just put
me out of my misery.
This time every year, the Miyamizu Shrine holds its harvest festival, and
Yotsuha and I have the misfortune of being the stars of the show. On this day,
we wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear
jingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura
hall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose
meaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.
We're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,
twirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.
During my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and
got even more depressed. Those little— I told them and told them not to come,
and they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text
them tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.
Sure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,
I'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's
more embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The
part that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.
Oh, for the love of—
I don't wanna!
Plagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the
dance ends. Agh. Here it comes.
Munch, munch, munch.
Munch.
Munch, munch, munch, munch.
I'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to
think, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing
the exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small
wooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,
a diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.
Munch, munch, munch.
Munch, munch.
Agh, I swear...
Munch, munch, munch.
I'm going to have to do it soon.
Munch, munch.
Arrrgh.
Munch.
Giving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,
attempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.
And then. Aaagh.
Puckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The
mixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I
feel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.
Please, nobody look at me.
Mouth-brewed sake.
It's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with
saliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to
the gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I
don't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first
century... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!
I mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice
and put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the
exact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over
and over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.
Inside, I'm crying my eyes out.
Abruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a
faint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.
Curses.
I want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy
"in-crowd" classmates. They're watching me with smirks on their faces and
gleefully gossiping about something. There's too much distance between us for
me to really hear them but I feel as though I'm hearing them loud and clear.
Eeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how
can she do that in public? Nobody's ever gonna marry her now.

"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!"
I glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office
entrance.
After the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a
banquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was
the hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.
"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a
sweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. "
"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead—drink some
more!"
We entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally
turned us loose just now, saying, "You kids can go on home." Gran and the
other adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.
"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?"
On the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool
sounds of insect songs echo all around us.
"I dunno. Sixty?"
"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!"
"Huh."
"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.
They're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the
whole place!"
"Hmm..."
What I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but
Yotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,
she's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving
up, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,
shining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.
"...That's it!"
As we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha
suddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a
cake someone hid from her.
"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay
your way to Tokyo?!"
For a moment, I'm speechless.
".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that."
"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and
call it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!"
Should I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?
Still, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she
really is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll
give this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell
sake on your own like that?
"Well? What do you think, Sis?"
"Hmm..."
.. .And that's all I have to say.
".. .Wait, no! It'd be against the liquor laws!"
Wait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,
I've broken into a run. All sorts of incidents and feelings and prospects and
doubts and despairs are jumbled together inside me, and it feels like my heart's
about to explode. I run down the steps, taking them two at a time, slam on the
brakes under the torii gate on the landing, and suck in a huge lungful of chilly
night air. Then I expel the cluttered mess in my chest along with it.
"I'm sick of this town! I'm sick of this life! Make me a hot guy in Tokyo in
my next life, puhleeeease!"
Eeease. Eeease. Eeease. Eeease...
My wish echoes around the dark mountains, then disappears as though
drawn into Itomori Lake below me. The words came out on impulse, and
they're so dumb, my head cools right down, as does my sweat.

and all the skin over it is being pulled toward that one spot.

I take another look around the room. There are photos and design sketches
of bridges and buildings and structures all over the walls. The floor is a
careless mess of magazines and paper bags and cardboard boxes. Compared to
the Miyamizu house, tidy as a venerable old Japanese inn (all thanks to Gran),
this place seems wild and lawless. The room is really small—probably a
condominium. If this is my dream, I have no idea where it came from, but I'm
impressed by how real it seems. I guess I've got a pretty good imagination.
Maybe I could be some kind of artist when I grow up.
Tweedle!
A text alert echoes from the depths of the hall with such impeccable timing
that it seems like a comeback. Eep! I gasp, hastily dashing back to the room
where the bed was. The smartphone's on the floor beside the sheets, and
there's a short message on its screen.
Are you still home? Get over here, run!
Tsukasa
Huh? What? What's this? Who in the world is Tsukasa?!
At any rate, I guess I have to go to school. I scan the room. My eyes stop on
a boy's uniform hanging beside the window, and as I pick it up, I'm suddenly

Somebody abruptly throws an arm around my shoulders from behind, and I
give a wordless yelp. When I look, a bespectacled CEO-type (only neat and
sophisticated) is smiling at me, close enough that our bangs are almost
touching. Eeeeeek! 'Scuse me, mister—this is the closest I've ever been to a

With that, the kid with glasses sets off down the hall, still hugging my
shoulders. No, seriously, you're way too close!
"Ignore my text, will you?" he accuses, but he doesn't sound mad. Then I
figure it out.
".. .Excuse me... Wait, Tsukasa?"
"Ha-ha, 'excuse me'? Do I detect a note of contrition?"
I don't know how to respond to that, so for the moment, I quietly extricate
myself from his arm.
"...Yougot lost?"
Takagi—a big, good-natured guy—shouts, not bothering to hide his
astonishment.
"How the heck did you manage to get lost on the way to school?"
"Um..." I falter. The three of us are sitting in a corner of the wide rooftop.
It's supposed to be lunchtime right now, but there aren't many people around.
Maybe they're avoiding the summer sun.

Takagi and Tsukasa eye each other dubiously. Oops, that's right: I'm Taki

"Sorry."

"Huh?!" I have an accent? I turn red.

"Tsukasa, you got anything?"
"Egg sandwich. Let's stick that croquette of yours in here."
Here. The two of them hand me the improvised egg-croquette sandwich.
Their kindness touches my heart.

to her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and
I can't read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a
gentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small—and
yet she's got big boobs. She's just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I
catch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.
Perfect!
"Miss Okudera?"
Just as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the
head.
"That's senpai to you!" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He
goes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got
seniority on me. Okay!
"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really..."
"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?"
As she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes
curve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of
beauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel
compelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look
down.
"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just..."
"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let
him have his food for free, but..."
She doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping
down another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...
"Eek! Okudera-senpai!"
Another waitress cries out.
"Your skirt!"
"Hmm?"
Miss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now
that I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a
shocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.
"Are you hurt?"
"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?"
"I think something like that's happened before..."
"Was someone harassing you?"
"Do you remember the guy's face?"
Several staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.
Eyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the
words I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I
see little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.
This time, I need to rescue her.
The thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,
I've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my
back ("Hey! Taki, you little..."), but I ignore them.
The green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at
least one more design element. The brown is— Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The
cream is for its nose.
Pinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For
some reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing
room sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate
repair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly
good at.
"All done!"
I hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to
finish.
"...Huh? This is..."
The dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing
room quickly shifts to surprise.
"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!"
The tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so
as I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.
The skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought
being a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like
Okudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but
when she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the
neighborhood.
"You really saved me today. Thank you very much."
I finally managed to say it.
"Heh-heh!" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.
"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but
you're always so quick to fight."
As she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I
grasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.
"I like this version of you better," Okudera-senpai says, a bit
mischievously. "You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki."
My heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It
makes me want to give her everything I have for free.

By now, I've realized that Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.
Convenience stores, family restaurants, the people I pass, the edge of the park,
construction sites, the station at night, the inside of the train... Almost every ten
steps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced
smells when gathered in one place.
And for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person
living in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that
stretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the
overwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.
Taki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand
toward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but
I guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,
as if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know
"Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself."
Back at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this
morning.
I'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1
had! Isn't that amazin '? Aren't you awed by my fantastic imagination?! It s
like I actually went to Tokyo! I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist—or no, wait,
I'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll
probably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?
Fantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick
up Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my
fingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary
[9/7 Ate at KFC with Tsukasa and Co.] [9/6
Movie in Hibiya] [8/31 Architecture Tour—
Bayside Edition] [8/25 Payday!]
As I scroll backward through the headers, I'm impressed in spite of myself.
"He's real thorough." Then I tap the photo app. Most of the pictures are
landscapes. After those, the majority are of him with Tsukasa and Takagi.
Eating ramen together, going to the park together... They sure are close. A beet
bowl place, a soba shop at the station, a trendy hamburger joint. The road
home from school. Sunset through the gaps between the buildings. His friends'
backs. Jet contrails in the sky overhead.
"Lucky him, livin' in Tokyo..."
As I murmur, a yawn slips out. Starting to get sleepy, I go to the next photo.
"Oh, it's Okudera-senpai."
The picture is of her back as she's cleaning the restaurant window, and it
feels like a candid shot. In the next, she's noticed and turned to face the
camera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.
...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It's bound to be
unrequited, though. She's in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.
I sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in
everything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but
connected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from
work, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in
the entry, wanting to report it—or brag about it—to Taki Tachibana. Once I'm
done, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...
Who are you?
For some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.
Vaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room
in Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something
oddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the
palm of my hand, I write:
Mitsuha
Yaaaawwn...
That's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,
thrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored
shower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to
finish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the
writing on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.`,length:3970,num_lines:62,location:"Train",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Connection",role:"Exploring the bond between characters",importance:.9,emotion:"Nostalgic camaraderie",sentiment:.7,quote:"I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy, as if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Dreams",role:"Reflecting on personal ambitions",importance:.8,emotion:"Hopeful excitement",sentiment:.8,quote:"I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist—or no, wait, I'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Identity",role:"Questioning self and existence",importance:.7,emotion:"Curious introspection",sentiment:.5,quote:"Who are you?",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Urban Life",role:"Capturing the essence of city living",importance:.6,emotion:"Awed appreciation",sentiment:.6,quote:"Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:9,importance_rank:10,conflict_rank:14},{title:"Waking Up as Taki",summary:"The protagonist wakes up as Taki again, confused about the previous day.",chapter:"Chapter Three Days",first_line:438,last_line:508,text:`"...What is this?"
I say the words aloud, despite myself. I'm staring at my hand.
Finally, I let my eyes drop from the letters on my palm down to my
wrinkled uniform and necktie... So, what—I fell asleep without changing?
"—Wh.. .wh-what is this?!"
This time, I actually yell. We're having breakfast, and my dad glances at me
but promptly loses interest and returns his attention to his bowl. I stare at my
phone, stunned. There's a really long journal entry on it that I don't remember
writing.
...And on the way home from work, Okudera-
senpai and I walked to the station together, just
the two of us! It's all because I'm in touch with
my feminine side.
"Taki, want to hit another cafe today?"
"Uh, sorry, I've got work after this."
"Ha-ha. You know where to go?"
"Huh? .. .Hey! Tsukasa, you jerk, was that you?"
I raise my voice without meaning to. Actually, I wish it was him. Tsukasa's
puzzled expression tells me it wasn't, though. Even I know there's no reason
somebody'd go to all that trouble for a prank.
Getting up from my chair, I reluctantly excuse myself:
".. .Nah, never mind. See ya."
As I leave the classroom, I hear Takagi's voice behind me. Dude's back to
normal today.
An uneasy shiver shoots through me, and my feet get cold. Something very
weird is happening to me.
"...Wh-what?"
After I change into my work clothes, three of my senior coworkers are
standing outside the changing room when I open the door, blocking my way.
There's one regular staffer and two college part-timers, all guys, and they're
glaring at me with eyes that look bloodshot or maybe teary... Either way, not
good. I swallow hard, and the three of them start in on me in menacing tones.
"Taki, you scumbag, whaddaya think you're doing, getting a jump on us?"
"You'd better have an excuse, weasel." "You two left together yesterday,
didn't you?"
"Huh... Wait, no way—seriously?! I did? With Okudera-senpai?!"
Meaning that journal entry was real?!
"What happened with you two after that?!"
"Uh, no, I.. .1 really don't remember much..."
"Don't gimme that crap!"
Just as it looks like somebody's gonna haul me up by my shirtfront, a cool
voice echoes through the hall.
"Okudera, reporting for duty."
Okudera-senpai arrives, her long, bare legs and the shoulders peeking out
of her top gleaming in the light. She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals
clicking pleasantly.
"Hello, everyone."
"Hi!"
She's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning
presence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about
our problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.
"Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?"
I can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly
delivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the
door. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.
This is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until
they shine, right this minute.
".Hey. Taki."
The guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the
depths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.
—Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I
wonder:
What's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...
Nah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?
What the heck is "Mitsuha "?
The birds are energetically twittering away again this morning. There's a
newborn clarity to the early sun that streams in through the paper sliding doors,
and the morning is peaceful, as usual. Even so, although I've just woken up,
unfamiliar writing with a quality of pure, concentrated irritation is scrawled
across my arm.

Dumb stuff like that. When you heard them, you said, "That's me they're talkin'
about, right?" So I said I thought it probably was. I mean, if you ask me, I'm
gonna answer, right? Then, Mitsuha, what do you suppose you did?
You seriously don't remember? You kicked the desk with the vase on it

I'm holed up in my room, staring at my phone in denial. For a while now,
my fingers have been shaking as if they partly belong to somebody else as I
scroll through the entries in my journal app. Sandwiched between the ones I
wrote, there are several headers I don't remember.

Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?"
Yotsuha whines.
Gran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.
"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either."
Mayugorou?
".. .Who's that?" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.
"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous."
Famous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.
The three Miyamizu women—me, the grandma, and Yotsuha—have been
hiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're
taking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.
These people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.
The sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.
The air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the
pleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in
this town now.
Come to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.
The thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this
mountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong
walker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've
never lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what
kind of shape she's in.
"Hey, Grandma!"
I break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this
little old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really
good lunches.
"Let me piggyback you. If you want..."
"Oh, may I?" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto
my back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at
somebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,
warm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs
nothing.
"Grandma, you're way light— Whoa!"
The moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.
Yotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, "Come on, Sis!" Come to think of it,
Mitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the
world this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.
"Mitsuha, Yotsuha."
I hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.
"Are you familiar with musubiT '
" MusubiT '
Yotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to
her stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole
round lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from
climbing with her grandma on her back.
"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of
spirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's."
Guardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old
lady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and
it's oddly persuasive.
"Did you know?" she starts again. "Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'
people is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the
same word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the
braided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself."
I can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I
think.
"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'
undone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's
musubi ."
Without really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up
against rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a
whole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,
but I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I
wake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,
falling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry
mountain.
"Here, drink up."
We take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.
It's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,
and I drain two cups in a row. "C'mon! Me too!" Yotsuha pesters. This may be
the best drink I've ever had.
"That's another musubi."
"Huh?"
As I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.
She's sitting at the base of a tree.
"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
called musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your
soul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition

Half of Mitsuha.
I look at the urn in my hands. It's that special sake, the stuff she made by
chewing up rice. This sake was made by "binding" rice and this body... And

Yotsuha is searching the sky, blocking out the setting sun with her palm.
"Comet?"
Now that she mentions it, I remember they were talking about something
like that on TV during breakfast, about how the comet's been close enough to
be visible to the naked eye for a few days now and how, just after sunset today,
we'd probably be able to see it if we looked diagonally above Venus.
"The comet..."
I say it aloud one more time. Out of nowhere, I feel as if I've forgotten
something.
I narrow my eyes, searching the western sky, and find what I'm looking for
right away. Above Venus, which is especially bright, I see the comet's shining
blue tail. In the depths of my memory, something's trying to surface.
That's right. Once before, I...
That comet—
".. .My, my. Mitsuha."
Before I know she's there, Grandma's peering up at me—into me. My
shadow is reflected at the bottom of her deep black eyes.
"You're dreamin', aren't you?"
!
All of a sudden...
I wake up.
I've flung the sheet away, and it falls off the bed without a sound. My
heart's pounding hard enough to raise my ribs (at least I think it is), but I can't
hear my heartbeat. That's weird— But just after the thought forms, little by
little, I start hearing my blood pumping. The morning sparrows outside the
window, car engines, the rumble of trains. As if I'm finally remembering
where I am, my ears begin taking in Tokyo.
"...Tears?"
I touch my cheek and find droplets of water on my fingertips.
Why? I don't know. I wipe my eyes with my palm. Even as I do, the twilight
landscape from a moment ago and the old lady's words are disappearing, like
water soaking into sand.
Tweedle.
By my pillow, my phone chirps.
I'm almost there. I'm looking forward to today, r;
It's a Line message from Okudera-senpai.
Almost here? What's she talking about? .. .And then I gasp.
"Wait, did Mitsuha—? Not again!" Panicked, I dive into my phone and read
Mitsuha's memo. "Adate?!"
I bolt out of bed and get ready at top speed.
Date with Okudera-senpai in Roppongi
tomorrow! She'll be waiting in front of Yotsuya
Station at 10:30. It's a date I want to go on, but
if I'm unlucky and it ends up being you, be
grateful and enjoy it.
Fortunately, the place where we're meeting is nearby. I sprint flat out and
arrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to
make sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend
morning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.
I wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter "Mitsuha,
you idiot" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.
...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,
this is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,
or an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.
Mitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places
with me!
"Taaaki!"
"Waugh!"
A voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I
turn around.
"Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?"
"No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no..."
What's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,
and if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,
what's the right answer?
"Urn, I, er..."
Flustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.
My eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a
black off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and
legs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed
strategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a
large mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.
She looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.
"...I just got here."
"Oh, good!" she laughs, sounding chipper.
"Shall we?"
She takes my arm... Ah, for a moment—just a moment—your breast
touched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in
this town.
"The conversation keeps dying..."
In the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it
against the mirror.
Three hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever
been in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope
that's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation
unprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too
pretty.
I mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.
Then they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're
thinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,
anyway.
Well, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I
want to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.
Consequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can
tell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely
uncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.
Dammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!
Hoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.
...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.
And so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked
links, just for you!
"Whoa, seriously?!"
Look at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them
for dear life.
Link 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a
communication disorder
Link 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever
been the tiniest bit popular!
Link 3: \\bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on
texts they'll love
.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.
Walking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.
I'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled
Nostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-
senpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.
Furano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is
divided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't
know the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can
make out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's
summer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem
oddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you
go. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. "Shibuya
and Ikebukuro," for example, or "Akasaka and Kichijouji," or "Meguro and
Tachikawa."
Even so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.
This one is different from the others.
Well, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place—the contours
of the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red
shrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick
out your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I
never actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations
when I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful
sense of deja vu about the place. This is—
"Taki?"
When I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a
second, I forgot she existed.
"You know, Taki," she says with an even smile, "you seem like a different
person today."
She executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me
behind.
I blew it.
All I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole
thing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even
consider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.
Even though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I
should've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've
spent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.
From the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi
buildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.
My eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.
Her hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,
she might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat
tighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I
grope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.
"Um, Okudera-senpai?"
She doesn't turn.
".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere—"
"Why don't we call it a day instead?" she suggests with the tone of a patient
teacher.
"Okay."
On the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-
senpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun
—I can't see it clearly.
"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?"
"Sure."
"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?"
"Huh?!" She knew?! How?!
"And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?"
"Huuuuuuuh?!" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical
rain forest. "N-no, there isn't!"
"Really?"
"Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!"
"I wonder..."
Okudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,
there's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long
hair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost
immediately.
"Well, never mind."
Her tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.
"Huh?"
"Thank you for today. I'll see you at work."
Okudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me
behind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no
words come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends
from the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.
I gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of
summer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,
and after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on
a real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's
disappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it
the entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.
It feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of
anything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming
Mitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,
we're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound
together the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think
I'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.
"That's why you're not popular, you know. " "It's your fault for promising
stuff without checking first. "
I open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.
The comet should be visible just about the time
the date ends.
Eeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.

through boring classes. I eat lunch with Tsukasa and Takagi. I walk through
town, looking up at the sky. Somewhere along the way, its blue has grown a
little deeper. Bit by bit, the trees lining the streets begin to change color.
In my room at night, I draw. On my desk, there's a stack of mountain
guidebooks I borrowed from the library. I search the ranges of Hida on my
smartphone. I look for ridgelines that match the ones I remember. I keep my
pencil in motion, trying to copy them down onto paper somehow.

"Approaching Nagoya ," a lazy voice announces over the train's
loudspeaker.
The exchanges with Mitsuha started out of the blue one day and ended just
as suddenly. No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn't figure out why.
After several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have
been a string of extremely vivid dreams.
I've got proof, though. I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on
my phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could
never have happened if I'd been myself. I'm convinced Mitsuha's a real girl.
Her body heat, her pulse, the way she breathes, her voice, the red light
dawning over her closed eyes, the vibrant sounds in her ears—I felt all of that
myself. Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't
alive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.
Because of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.
Something might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.
Maybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I'm overthinking things, at the
very least, she's bound to be worried about the situation, too. That's why I
decided to go see her in person. But...`,length:1233,num_lines:19,location:"Train",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Reality Vs.

Okudera-senpai
sounds incredulous, stuffing her face with a box lunch she picked up at the
station.
"...Right."
"Your only clue is what the town looks like? You can't even contact this
girl? Are you kidding me?!"
I didn't ask her to come with me. How come I'm getting blamed? I look at
Tsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso
cutlet.
"You are an abysmal tour planner."
"This isn't a tour!"
I lose it for a second. These two think they're on some kind of field trip. I
can read their expressions clearly. There's just no help for this child. Why are
they acting all superior, anyway?
"Well, never mind," Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,
throwing out her chest. "Don't you worry, Taki. We'll help you look."
"Eeeee, it's so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!"
At the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes
over the area's laid-back mascot. It's a full-body plush cow costume wearing a
station employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click
in the little terminal.
"You guys are in the way."
As I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced
that these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her
myself.
The plan goes like this:
Since I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to
a spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll
have to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing
the drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working
our way north along the local line. There's a railroad crossing in one of the
scenes I remember, so following the tracks should work.
It's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a
"plan" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that
many towns built around lakes. I'm convinced I'll probably find some kind of
hint by tonight, though I've got no grounds for thinking that.
Psyching myself up, I take a confident first step, heading out to talk to the
driver of the lone taxi parked outside the station.
".. .This isn't gonna work..."
I'm slumped at a bus stop, my head drooping.
All the confidence I had when we started asking around has completely
caved.
After that first taxi driver gave me a blunt "N-nope, dunno," we tried police
boxes, convenience stores, souvenir shops, guest houses, diners, and everyone
from farmers to grade-school kids, oblivious to how we probably looked, but
our results were solidly negative. The fact that there was only one local train
every two hours made it hard for us to get around, so we thought we'd try
asking people on the bus. We boarded in high spirits but were the only
passengers. I didn't even feel like asking the driver at that point, and the last
stop was way out in the middle of nowhere, with no houses anywhere in sight.
The whole time, Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai cheerfully made the most of their
day trip, playing word games, cards, phone games, variations on rock-paper-
scissors, and eating snacks. Eventually, they ended up on either side of me on
the bus, leaning against my shoulders and dozing peacefully.
Now, as the two of them guzzle cola in front of the bus stop, I sigh. They
hear it and react together.
"Oh, come on, Taki! You're giving up already?!"
"What about all our hard work?!"
I heave another sigh, so deep it almost brings my lungs up with it. Okudera-
senpai's wearing oddly gung-ho clothes meant for serious hiking. In contrast,
Tsukasa's in chinos like he's just strolling around the neighborhood. At this
point, both outfits really irritate me.
"You guys have been zero help.
They both look innocent, as if to say, Oh, really?
"I'll have a Takayama ramen."
"One Takayama ramen here."
"Uh, okay, then I'll have the same, too."
"You betcha. Three ramen!" says the middle-aged lady cheerily.
On our fruitless way to the next (abnormally distant) station, we found a
ramen shop that was miraculously open and made a beeline inside. When the
lady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, "C'mon in," her smile seemed a
beacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're
lost.
The ramen's good, too. Contrary to its name, it's perfectly ordinary ramen
(I thought it might have Hi da beef on top, but it was regular braised pork), but
as soon as I eat the noodles and veggies, I can feel my body recharging. After
draining the soup bowl dry and drinking two cups of water, I finally take a
breather.
"Do you think we'll be able to get back to Tokyo today?" I ask Tsukasa.
"Hmm... I don't know. We may be cutting it close. Want me to check?"
Tsukasa apparently didn't expect this but nevertheless pulls out his phone
and starts looking up how to get home.
"Thanks," I tell him.
"Taki, you're sure that's all right?" Okudera-senpai asks.
She's across the table from me and hasn't finished eating yet. I'm not
immediately sure how to answer, so I look out the window. The sun's just
barely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields
along the prefectural highway.
"I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track," I
mutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my
strategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town
with sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how
it starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely
ordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered
around a round lake. Even though it felt so solid to me when I finished drawing
it, it looks like an anonymous, mediocre landscape now.
"That's old Itomori, ain't it?"
"Huh?" I turn around and see the lady's apron. She's pouring water into my
empty cup.
"Did you draw that, son? Say, can I have a look?" She takes the sketchbook
from me. "This is a real good picture. Hon, c'mere a sec!"
The woman shouts back toward the kitchen. The three of us watch her,
mouths agape.
The ramen shop owner comes out of the kitchen and considers the sketch,
smiling a little. "Oh, yeah. That was Itomori, for sure. Takes me back..."
"My man's from Itomori, you see."
Itomori?
Suddenly, I remember. I start up out of my chair.
"Itomori... Yeah, Itomori! Of course, why couldn't I remember that? It's
Itomori! It's near here, isn't it?!"
The couple looks mystified, exchanging perplexed glances. The man opens
his mouth.
"Kid... You know about Itomori, don't you? That's where—"
Tsukasa interrupts loudly. "Itomori?! Taki, don't tell me—"
"What, wait—? You mean, the one where the comet...?!"
Even Okudera-senpai speaks up, eyes wide.
"Huh.?"
I don't understand what's going on and look around at the others. They're
all watching me dubiously. The shadow of something that's been trying to
surface in my mind this whole time rustles stealthily, growing more and more
ominous.
The cry of a kite trails through the atmosphere, lonely enough to freeze the
blood.
A row of Do Not Enter barricades extends as far as the eye can see,
throwing long shadows over the cracked asphalt.
A sign with vines tangled around it reads, In accordance with the
Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act, this area is off-limits. KEEP OUT.
—Reconstruction Agency.
And below me lies Itomori, devastated by some unimaginable force and
mostly swallowed up by the lake.

I tear my eyes away from the ruins below me, scanning my surroundings.
"It isn't just the town. I remember this schoolyard, the mountains around us,
the high school... I remember all of it perfectly!"
I have to shout the words to convince myself. Behind us is the school
building, black and sooty, with some of its windows broken. We're standing on
the grounds of Itomori High School, looking out across the lake.
"So you're saying this is the town you were looking for? The one where
your friend online lives?" Tsukasa shouts, that parched smile still clinging to
his voice.
"That's not even possible! That disaster was three years ago. Hundreds of
people died! You remember it, right, Taki?!"
At that, I finally turn toward Tsukasa.
"...Died?"
I meant to look at his face, but my gaze goes right through him, then through
the high school behind him, only to dissipate into the distance. I know I must be
looking at something, but there's nothing there.
"Three years ago...she died?"
Abruptly, I remember.
The comet I saw over Tokyo three years earlier. Countless shooting stars
falling through the western sky. I thought it was beautiful, like something out of
a dream. I got all excited about it.
That's when she died?
Don't.
I can't acknowledge that.
I search for words. For proof.
"That can't be true... I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote."
I retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the
battery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up
Mitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.
I rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.
"Wha...?"
First one letter, then another.
The words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.
Before long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by
one, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding
down delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.
"Why...?" I ask very quietly.
The kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.
Three years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet
with a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach
to Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put
Halley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4
billion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly
seventy-five thousand miles of Earth—closer than the moon. The tail of this
shining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first
time in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it
welcomed Comet Tiamat.
Until the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's
nucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in
diameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,
plummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per
second. Tragically, it struck Japan—a residential area called Itomori.
The town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision
occurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which
must have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.
The meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The
destruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge
hole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,
magnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds
later, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater
part of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the
town's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in
human history.
Since the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,
ultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.
Damage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the
thousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In
less than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.
Fourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori
was gone.
—These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.
Three years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet
Tiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.
.. .But that's weird.
It doesn't make sense.
I lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.
That means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.
The comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each
other.
It'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.
However, paging through books in this city library near Itomori, I'm
hopelessly confused. For a while now, in the deepest corner of my mind,
someone's been whispering, This is where you were.
Vanished Itomori—Complete Records
Itomori—The Village That Sank in a Night
The Tragedy of Comet Tiamat
I flip through tome after tome with titles like these. The photos of bygone
days in Itomori unmistakably show places I've been. This is the grade school
Yotsuha goes to. Miyamizu Shrine is where their grandma is the chief priestess.
This pointlessly big parking lot, the two snack bars right next to each other, the
convenience store that looks like a barn, the little railroad crossing on the
mountain road, and of course Itomori High School... At this point, I recognize
all of them clearly. Seeing those ruined streets with my own eyes has
sharpened my memories.
It's hard to breathe. My heart is struggling, beating irregularly, and refuses
to calm down.
It feels as though the vivid photos are silently absorbing the air and any
sense of reality.

The photo above the caption shows high schoolers in the middle of a three-
legged race. The pair on the end seems familiar. One has straight-cut bangs and
braids. The other girl's hair is bound up with an orange cord.
The air gets even thinner.
I feel as though hot blood is oozing down the back of my neck, but when I
wipe it away with my hand, it's transparent sweat.

I look up. Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai are standing there. They hand me a
single book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:
Itomori Comet Disaster List and Catalog of Victims
I turn the pages. The victims' names and addresses are given by district. I
run my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on
names I recognize.
Teshigawara, Katsuhiko (17)
Natori, Sayaka (17)
"Teshigawara and Saya..."
As I murmur, I hear Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai suck in their breath.
Then I find the names that prove it all.
Miyamizu, Hitoha (82)
Miyamizu, Mitsuha (17)
Miyamizu, \\btsuha (9)
The other two peer over my shoulder at the list.

the sinewy hands on the steering wheel beside me.
It's the man from the ramen shop. He's the one who took us to Itomori High
School yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,
and he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn't worked, I
was planning to hitchhike, but I can't imagine any cars would've given me a
ride to a ruined, abandoned town. I'm seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.
From the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New
Itomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the
water. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams
jutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have
gotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the
place has always been like this. For that reason, I don't really know how to
process what I'm seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my
own helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much
for ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning
in the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if
the gods have set an enormous lid there.
We travel north along the lake, and when the car can't go any higher, the
man sets the parking brake.
"Looks like rain," he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. "This
mountain ain't real steep, but don't push your luck. If anythin' happens, you call
us."
"Yessir."
"Also, here—" He holds out a big lunch box to me. "Eat this up top."
Automatically, I accept it with both hands. It's heavy.
"Th-thank you very much..."
.. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,
and the ramen was super good. I can't make any of the words come out the way
I want them to—all I manage is a tiny "Thanks. Really." The guy smiles
slightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.
"I dunno what's goin' on with you," he says, exhaling smoke. "But that
picture ofltomori you made. That was good."
There's a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.
I'm walking up a path to the shrine that's as vague as a deer track.
Sometimes I stop to check the destination I've marked on the map against
the GPS on my phone. It's all right—I'm getting closer. The surrounding
scenery looks sort of familiar, but I've climbed this mountain only once, in a
dream. I'm not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow
the map.
After I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride
was completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-
senpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here
because they were worried about me. I must've looked really pathetic. I bet
they thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively
distracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn't.
I can't keep acting like that forever. I can't keep taking advantage of the
help people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the
gaps in the trees.
Suddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle
and shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.
The rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt
away.
The temperature's falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my
skin.
I eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There
are three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-
sliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like
such a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it's funny. My body shakes with
cold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and
swallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.
This is musubi, I think.
"Putting anything in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
called musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. "
That day, I decided I'd remember those words even after I woke up. I say it
aloud:
"...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That's
musubi. That's time."
I look at the cord on my wrist.

Sure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant

"It's really there! It wasn't a dream!"
The rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I
scrub roughly at my face with my sleeve, then start down the slope into the
caldera.
In front of me, what was a little stream in my memories is now a decent-
size pond. Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that
dream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several
dozen yards away on the other side.
This is the edge of the next world.
I remember somebody saying that to me once.
Does that make this the Sanzu River?
I step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot
into a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The
heavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing
sound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with
muddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm
not welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,
into the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get
across somehow.
The massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.
I don't know whether the "body of the god" is the tree, the rock, or whether
the shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's
a little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go
down it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.
The silence here is even deeper than it was outside.
I unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to
make sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single
movement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems
completely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.
This place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.
The tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,
two four-inch urns sit side by side.
"It's the sake we carried up here."
Gently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold
anymore.
"This is her little sister's..."
My hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick
it up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put
down roots.
"And this is the one I brought."
I sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on
it. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It
must have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this
time into words.
. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?"
I untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.
"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died
three years ago when the meteorite fell?"
I pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the
lid.
"Half of her..."
I bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles
floating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.
" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then
reuniting..."
I raise the lidful of sake to my lips.
"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time..."
Take me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound
is so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it
hits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.
But nothing happens.
For a little while, I sit very still.
I'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly
vague and dizzy... But that's all.
It's no good. It didn't work.
I put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm
falling , I think.
...That's weird.
I've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back
doesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the
cave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.
"The comet...!"
Involuntarily, I say it out loud.
There's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.
It's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing
its long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and
shimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the
cave.
I stare.
The image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.
Slowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat
of its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,
shining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.

I lift my eyes. Beyond the houses, the rolling outlines of mountains build on
each other, and beyond them, there's a misty blue ridgeline. The mountain I
climbed. The body of the god at the peak. The place where I drank the sake. A
light, cold wind blows up from the lake, stirring Mitsuha's newly short hair.

The last traces of the evening sun are fading
from the sky. Night will be here soon. As if to shove down the anxiety suddenly
amassing inside me, I force a smile and speak cheerfully. "Hey, Mitsuha. So
we don't forget each other after we wake up..." I take a felt-tip pen from my
pocket. I catch Mitsuha's right hand, then write on her palm "Let's write down
our names. Here."
I give the pen to Mitsuha.
She breaks into a smile. It's like watching a flower bloom. She takes my
right hand and sets the tip of the pen against it.
Tunk.
There's a tiny, hard noise by my feet. I look down, and there's the pen on
the ground.
"Huh?" I raise my head.
There's nobody in front of me.
"What...?"
I turn this way and that.
"Mitsuha? Hey, Mitsuha?"
I call louder. No response. Unnerved, I pace the area. The shadows are
sinking into blue-black darkness. Below me are leaden, featureless clouds, and
in the gloom below them, I can just make out gourd-shaped Itomori Lake.
Mitsuha's gone.
Night is here.
I'm back in my own body, three years in the fixture.
I look at my right hand. There's no braided cord on my wrist now. On my
palm, there's just one thin, short, half-drawn line. I touch it gently.
".. .1 was going to tell you..I mutter quietly to the line. "No matter where
in the world you are, I'll find you again. I swear."
Up in the sky, the comet's nowhere to be seen, and a few stars are beginning
to twinkle.
"Your name is Mitsuha."
I close my eyes, making sure of my memories, turning them into something I
can count on.
"It's okay. I remember!"
Confidence deepening, I open my eyes again. There's a white half-moon in
the distant horizon.
"Mitsuha, Mitsuha... Mitsuha, Misua, Misua. Your name is Misua!"
I'm yelling her name at the half-moon.
"Your name is...!"
Abruptly, the outline of the word I meant to utter blurs.
I quickly snatch up the pen and write the first letter of her name on my
palm... Or I try to.
66
After a single line, my hand stops. The tip of the pen starts to tremble. I
want to make it stop shaking and grip it tight. I try stabbing it in like a needle,
to carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an
inch. My lips move.
"...Who are you?"
The pen falls from my hand.
They're vanishing. Your name. Your memories.
"Why did I come here?"
I want to tether them to me somehow, to scrape the fragments of memory
together, so I say them aloud.
"Her... I came to see her! I came to save her! I wanted her to live!"
It's disappearing. Something so precious to me is disappearing.
"Who are you? Who are you, who are you, who are you...?"
Slipping away. Even the emotions I know I felt are leaving me.
"Somebody important, somebody I can't forget, somebody I didn't want to
forget!"
Everything's vanishing, sorrow and love alike. I don't even know why I'm
crying now. My emotions are disintegrating, crumbling like a sand castle.
"Who are you, who are you, who...?"
After the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it's
loneliness. In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all
that stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced
me to take.
Fine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is
loneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I
have, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet
again, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting
resolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll
forget even the fact that I've forgotten something.
And so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky
one last time:
"What's your name?"
The cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains. Asking its
question of the void over and over, it diminishes, bit by bit.

we take off our helmets and throw them away.

That day, the news about the comet's closest approach had pretty much
taken over the TV I wasn't all that interested in stars or the cosmos, but I did
find it kind of amazing how the universe is actually overflowing with
phenomena that exist on a completely different scale from humans, like a solar
orbit that lasts twelve hundred years or an orbital radius over 10.4 billion
miles. As impressions went, it was dumb. Still, it struck me as so awesome
that it made me shiver and, at the same time, so frightening it set my heart
trembling as well.
"Look!"
Suddenly, the announcer who'd been delivering commentary yelled in
excitement.
"The comet appears to have split in two. Around it are...what seem to be
countless shooting stars."

background of Tokyo skyscrapers. Thin lines like a meteor shower appeared

Job hunting, hmm?"
Okudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.
It's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly
languid hum of people released from their days at work or school.
"Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great."
"Hmm..." Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She
inspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, "You don't
think it's because suits don't look good on you?"
"I-is it really that bad?!" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.
"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!"
Okudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.
"Let's walk a little," Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,
going against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut
across Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that
the trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass
have on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,
too.
"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue."
Feeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to
Okudera-senpai beside me.
"What?" Her glossy lips pout. "I can't get in touch with you without a
reason?"
"No, no, no!" I wave my hands hastily.
"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time."
"Y-yes. I am."
She smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. "I was in the area
for work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki." She was hired by a major
clothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. "Life in the suburbs
is fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind," she tells me, gazing at
her surroundings like she's a little awestruck. "Look," she says suddenly, and I
raise my head.
We're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant
outdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage
of gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster—Eight
Years Later in big letters.
"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,
as though she's searching distant memories. "You were still in high school,
Taki, so it must've been..."
"Five years ago, maybe?" I finish the sentence for her.
"That long..." She exhales a little, as if surprised. "I'm forgetting all sorts
of things."
She's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk
up Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I
try remembering that day.
It was the summer of my second year in high school— No, it was just about
this time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short
trip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way
to Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.
Right, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the
side of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur
and grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a
vague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed
a mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to
Tokyo by myself the next day.
That's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that
comet.
In the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human
history, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,
almost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the
comet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and
most of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.
It was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all
sorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical
phenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the
media's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around
wildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit
with Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or
questioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an
evacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been
foretold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so
isolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the
power across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite
strike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the
programs to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as
with most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of
Itomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.
Still... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of
Itomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had
materialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had
visited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.
What in the world had it been?
Well, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink
into the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I
write the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job
next year, not ancient history I don't really remember.
"The wind's come up," Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair
rises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,
reaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a
melancholy inside me.
"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough," Okudera-senpai
says when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.`,length:5873,num_lines:91,location:"Tokyo",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Nostalgia",role:"Reflecting on past memories",importance:.9,emotion:"Melancholic longing",sentiment:.5,quote:"I'm forgetting all sorts of things.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Job Pressure",role:"Struggle for future stability",importance:.7,emotion:"Anxiety and uncertainty",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Ha-ha.

espresso, after informing me she was getting married. I couldn't manage a good
response—I just mumbled something congratulatory.
I'm not particularly unhappy , I think, watching Okudera-senpai's
silhouette descend the pedestrian-bridge stairs. That said, I don't really
understand what happiness is yet, either.
I abruptly inspect my palm. All that's there is an absence.
Just a little longer..., I think one more time.
Before I know it, the season's changed again.
An unusually typhoon-filled autumn passed, moving straight into a winter of
nothing but cold rain. Tonight, too, the rain is whispering down unabated, like
the memory of a pleasant chat on some bygone day Christmas lights twinkle
beyond windows beaded thickly with water droplets.
I take a sip from my paper cup of coffee, as if swallowing my scattered
thoughts, then look down at my notebook again. Even now, in December, it's
packed with job-hunting appointments.
Visits with former upperclassmen to discuss their work, information
sessions, entry deadlines, paper schedules, interview dates. The range is
chaotic, covering everything from major general contractors to design offices
to old-town factories, and as I check the notebook against the schedule on my
phone, even I'm a bit disgusted by it. I start organizing the main points from
tomorrow onward, writing them into my notebook.
"Y'know, I'd like to go to at least one more bridal fair."
Mixed with the sound of the rain, the conversations of strangers sound a bit
like secrets. The couple behind me has been discussing their wedding for a
while now, and it makes me think of Okudera-senpai. Their voices and bearing
are completely different, though. There's a bit of an easygoing regional accent
to their speech, and their conversation seems completely relaxed, as if they're
childhood friends. I'm not really listening, but my ears pick up what they're
saying.
"Again?" The guy sounds annoyed, but even then, there's no mistaking the
affection in his tone. "We've been to a ton of fairs already. They were all
pretty much the same stuff."
"Well, I was thinkin' a Shinto ceremony might be nice, too."
"You said your dream was to have it in a chapel."
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I can't make up my mind that easily."
"But you said you did make up your mind," the guy quietly complains, and I
chuckle.
The girl ignores him. "Hmm.she murmurs, thinking. "Never mind that.
Tesshi, you gotta shave off those whiskers before the ceremony."
I was about to drink my coffee, but my hand stops dead.
My pulse is speeding up, though I don't understand why.
"I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?"
"But you're eatin' cake!"
"I'll start for real tomorrow!"
Slowly, I look behind me.
The two of them have already gotten up from their chairs and are pulling on
their coats. The tall, skinny guy is wearing a stocking cap over his buzzed
head. I just catch a glimpse of his profile. The girl is petite, and her bobbed
hair makes her seem young, almost like a student. The pair turns away and
leaves the cafe. For some reason, I can't take my eyes off their backs.
"Thank you for your visit." The cafe employee's voice reaches my ears
indistinctly, mingled with the rain.
By the time I leave the cafe, the rain has turned to snow.
Maybe it's because of all the moisture up in the atmosphere, but the town is
oddly warm in the falling snow. I feel strangely uneasy, as if I've wandered
into the wrong season. It seems to me as if each and every person I pass is
hiding some important secret, and in spite of myself, I keep turning back to
look at them.
I go straight to the ward library, which is almost ready to close for the
evening. The sparseness of the handful of readers in the vast, vaulted space
makes the air inside feel even chillier than outside. I take a seat and open the
book I've retrieved from the stacks. The title is Vanished Itomori—Complete
Records. It's a collection of photographs.
As if removing an ancient seal, I slowly page through the book.
Gingko trees and an elementary school. The shrine's steep stairs, with their
view over the lake. A shrine gate with peeling paint. A tiny railroad crossing,
like toy building blocks abruptly set down in the fields. A pointlessly
expansive parking lot, two snack bars right next to each other, a drab concrete
high school. A prefectural road with old, cracked asphalt. A guardrail that
traces a winding hill road. Vinyl greenhouses, reflecting the sky.
They're the sort of ordinary sights you see all over Japan, so I recognize all
of them. I can visualize the temperature of the stone walls and the chill of the
wind, just as if I'd lived there.
Why is this so... ? I wonder as I turn the pages.
Why do the unremarkable sights of a town that no longer exists make my
heart hurt this much?

I decided something once. I took an oath because I met somebody—no, so
that I would meet somebody.
Washing my face and staring into the mirror, tossing a plastic bag in the
trash, squinting at the morning sun between the buildings, I think this and smile
wryly.
"Somebody," "something." In the end, I don't know a thing.
Still, I think as I close the door at an interview.
Still, even now, I'm fighting my way through. Perhaps it's a bit dramatic to
say, but I'm struggling against life. Wasn't that what I decided once? To
struggle. To live. To breathe and walk. To run. To eat. To bind, musubi. To live
an ordinary life so I shed tears over the sights of a perfectly ordinary town.

And then, I see him.
He's there, close enough to touch if it weren't for the windowpanes, on a
train running parallel to this one. He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are
wide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so
long really is.
She's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know
it's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes
between us, and I lose sight of her.
But I finally know what I'm wishing for.
I wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.
I want to be with him, just a little more.
The train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already
positive she's looking for me, too.
We've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an
assumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.
Even so, I—we—wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be
together, just a little more.
As I run along the sloping road, I wonder, Why am I running? Why am 1
searching? I probably know the answer. I don't remember it, but everything in
my body knows. I turn at a narrow alley, and the road drops off. Stairs. I walk
over to them, look down.. .and there he is.
Fighting back the urge to run, I climb the stairs slowly. A wind that smells
like flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the
top of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the
corner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts
softly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.
As we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say
anything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each
other. In that moment, I feel a tense, squeezing pain all over, as though
something inside me has taken hold of my heart. This is wrong, I think fiercely.
We can't possibly be strangers. It goes against something as basic as the
mechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...
And so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed. She's
standing on the stairs, the streets of Tokyo behind her, her eyes wide and round.
I realize her long hair is tied back with a cord the color of the evening sun. My
whole body trembles slightly.
I finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into
tears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.
Even as I cry, I smile, too. The spring air carries with it all sorts of
apprehension and anticipation, and I draw a deep breath.
Then we open our mouths at the same time.
