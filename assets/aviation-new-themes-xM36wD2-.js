Middle Ages. During this early period, the concepts of lift, stability, and
control were not well understood, and most attempts resulted in serious
injuries or death.
The Andalusian scientist Abbas ibn Firnas (810â887 AD) attempted to fly in
CÃ³rdoba, Spain, by covering his body with vulture feathers and attached two
wings to his arms. The 17th-century Algerian historian Ahmed Mohammed
al-Maqqari, quoting a poem by Muhammad I of CÃ³rdoba's 9th-century court poet
Mu'min ibn Said, recounts that Firnas flew some distance before landing with
some injuries, attributed to his lacking a tail (as birds use them to land). In
the 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that Eilmer of Malmesbury, an
11th-century Benedictine monk, attached wings to his hands and feet and flew a
short distance, but broke both legs while landing, also having neglected to
make himself a tail.
Many others made well-documented jumps in the following centuries. As late as

The reason these materials were so perfect for building kites is largely due to
the structure of the materials themselves.Â Bamboo being a strong, hollow
material, largely resembled the hollow bones in birds, which allow for less
weight, making flight easier. Some kites were fitted with strings and whistles
to make musical sounds while flying. Ancient and mediaeval Chinese sources
describe kites being used to measure distances, test the wind, lift men,
signal, and communicate and send messages. Later designs often depicted images
of flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical.

of rational aircraft design. Most notable of these was Leonardo da Vinci,
although his work remained unknown until 1797, and so had no influence on
developments over the next three hundred years. While his designs are rational,
they are not scientific. He particularly underestimated the amount of power
that would be needed to propel a flying object, basing his designs on the
flapping wings of a bird rather than an engine-powered propeller.
Leonardo studied bird and bat flight, claiming the superiority of the latter
owing to its unperforated wing. He analyzed these and anticipated many
principles of aerodynamics. He understood that "An object offers as much
resistance to the air as the air does to the object." Isaac Newton later
defined this as the third law of motion in 1687.
From the last years of the 15th century until 1505, Leonardo wrote about and
sketched many designs for flying machines and mechanisms, including
ornithopters, fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft (perhaps inspired by whirligig
toys), parachutes (in the form of a wooden-framed pyramidal tent) and a wind
speed gauge. His early designs were man-powered and included ornithopters and
rotorcraft; however, he came to realise the impracticality of this and later
turned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a
spring.
In an essay titled Sul volo (On flight), Leonardo describes a flying machine
called "the bird" which he built from starched linen, leather joints, and raw
silk thongs. In the Codex Atlanticus, he wrote, "Tomorrow morning, on the

called dirigibles today.
Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically
throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained
lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when Henri
Giffard flew 15 miles (24Â km) in France, with a steam engine-driven craft.
Another advancement was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable
free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, La France, by
Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs. The 170-foot (52Â m) long, 66,000-cubic-foot
(1,900Â m3) airship covered 8Â km (5.0Â mi) in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8Â½
horsepower electric motor.
However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail.
Routine, controlled flights did not occur until the advent of the internal
combustion engine.
The first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships
(sometimes called "blimps".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this
type of aircraft was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively
combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he
flew his airship Number 6 over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the
Eiffel Tower and back in under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe
prize. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The
subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard
to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.
At the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success,
the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These were far
more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo-carrying capacity
for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German
count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.
Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly
hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, Friedrichshafen. This was
intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned
with the wind. The prototype airship LZ 1 (LZ for "Luftschiff Zeppelin") had a
length of 128Â m (420Â ft), was driven by two 10.6Â kW (14.2Â hp) Daimler engines
and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.
Its first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was
forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight
had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent
flights, bettering the 6Â m/s speed attained by the French airship La France by
3Â m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It was several years
before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.
The German airship passenger service known as DELAG (Deutsche-Luftschiffahrts
AG) was established in 1910.
Although airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a
limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by
heavier-than-air craft.`,length:3104,num_lines:45,location:"Aviation History",importance:.5,conflict:0,characters:[{name:"Innovation In Aviation",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to the development of airships in the scene.",emotion:"Curiosity and Progress",sentiment:1,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Henri Giffard's achievement in powered flight embodies the curiosity and progress that fuels advancements in aviation.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Historical Significance",importance:1,importance_exp:"The historical context of airship development is crucial to understanding their evolution.",emotion:"Nostalgia and Pride",sentiment:1,quote:"The subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Challenges Of Design",importance:1,importance_exp:"The frailty and limitations of early airships highlight the challenges faced in their design.",emotion:"Frustration and Resilience",sentiment:-1,quote:"However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Competition And Controversy",importance:1,importance_exp:"The competitive nature of airship development illustrates the struggles for recognition and advancement.",emotion:"Tension and Rivalry",sentiment:-1,quote:"The subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Lagari's Rocket Launch",summary:"Evliya Ãelebi recounts Lagari's rocket flight.",chapter:"### 17th and 18th centuries",first_line:1,last_line:10,explanation:"Start of chapter",text:`Traveller Evliya Ãelebi reported that in 1633, Ottoman scientist and engineer

George Cayley was first called the "father of the aeroplane" in 1846. During
the last years of the 18th century, he had begun the first rigorous study of
the physics of flight and would later design the first modern heavier-than-air
craft. Among his many achievements, his most important contributions to
aeronautics include:
Cayley's research on the aeroplane aimed to address the four fundamental areas
that are essential to aeronautics: propulsion, structural design, aerodynamics,
and stability and control. His work laid the groundwork for a comprehensive
understanding of these critical components, which continue to be vital in the
field today.
Cayley's first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting
the whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple
aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a
complete design.
In 1799, he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying
machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.
In 1804, Cayley constructed a model glider, which was the first modern
heavier-than-air flying machine. It had the layout of a conventional modern
aircraft, with an inclined wing towards the front and an adjustable tail at the
back with both tailplane and fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the
model's centre of gravity.
In 1809, goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries, he began the
publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation"
(1809â1810). In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, "The
whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a
given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air". He
identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift,
drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs. He also
identified and described the importance of the cambered aerofoil, dihedral,
diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and
design of ornithopters and parachutes.`,length:2147,num_lines:32,location:"George Cayley's Workshop",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Innovation In Aviation",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to Cayley's contributions to aeronautics.",emotion:"Inspired and pioneering",sentiment:1,quote:"Cayley's research on the aeroplane aimed to address the four fundamental areas that are essential to aeronautics: propulsion, structural design, aerodynamics, and stability and control.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scientific Principles",importance:1,importance_exp:"Cayley's approach to aeronautics emphasizes the importance of scientific study.",emotion:"Analytical and methodical",sentiment:1,quote:"Cayley's first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting the whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a complete design.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Foundational Concepts",importance:1,importance_exp:"Cayley's work laid the groundwork for modern aeronautics.",emotion:"Foundational and essential",sentiment:1,quote:"In 1799, he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Understanding Forces",importance:1,importance_exp:"Identifying forces is crucial for aircraft design and stability.",emotion:"Insightful and critical",sentiment:1,quote:"He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift, drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:2,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Advancements in Steam Power",summary:"Explores the impact of steam power on aviation.",chapter:"### 19th century",first_line:49,last_line:84,explanation:"Shift to the Age of Steam.",text:`#### Age of steam
Drawing directly from Cayley's work, Henson's 1842 design for an aerial steam
carriage broke new ground. Although only a design, it was the first in history
for a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft.
1866 saw the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain and two
years later the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held at the Crystal
Palace, London, where John Stringfellow was awarded a Â£100 prize for the steam
engine with the best power-to-weight ratio. In 1848, Stringfellow achieved the
first powered flight using an unmanned 10 feet (3.0Â m) wingspan steam-powered
monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two
contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew
ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt
was more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving
thirty yards of straight and level powered flight. Francis Herbert Wenham
presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the
Royal Aeronautical Society), On Aerial Locomotion. He advanced Cayley's work on
cambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had
constructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five
stacked wings. He realised that long, thin wings are better than bat-like ones
because they have more leading edge for their area. Today this relationship is
known as the aspect ratio of a wing.
The latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study,
characterized by the "gentleman scientists" who represented most research
efforts until the 20th century. Among them was the British
scientist-philosopher and inventor Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who studied
lateral flight control and was the first to patent an aileron control system in
1868.
In 1871, Wenham made the first wind tunnel using a fan, driven by a steam
engine, to propel air down a 12Â ft (3.7Â m) tube to the model.
Meanwhile, the British advances had galvanised French researchers. In 1857,
FÃ©lix du Temple proposed a monoplane with a tailplane and retractable
undercarriage. Developing his ideas with a model powered first by clockwork and
later by steam, he eventually achieved a short hop with a full-size manned
craft in 1874. It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a
ramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the
first successful powered glide in history.`,length:2502,num_lines:36,location:"Aviation History",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Innovation And Experimentation",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to the advancements described in the scene.",emotion:"Excitement and Progress",sentiment:1,quote:"Henson's 1842 design for an aerial steam carriage broke new ground.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scientific Principles",importance:1,importance_exp:"The scene highlights the efforts of scientists and inventors in aeronautics.",emotion:"Curiosity and Determination",sentiment:1,quote:"The latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study, characterized by the 'gentleman scientists' who represented most research efforts until the 20th century.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Collaboration And Competition",importance:1,importance_exp:"The scene illustrates the collaborative efforts and competitive spirit among inventors.",emotion:"Motivation and Rivalry",sentiment:1,quote:"the British advances had galvanised French researchers.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Theoretical Developments",summary:"Details various theorists and their contributions to flight.",chapter:"### 19th century",first_line:85,last_line:127,explanation:"Focus on theorists and their inventions.",text:`In 1865, Louis Pierre Mouillard published an influential book The Empire Of The
Air (l'Empire de l'Air).
In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first flight higher than his
point of departure, by having his glider "L'Albatros artificiel" pulled by a
horse on a beach. He reportedly achieved a height of 100 metres, over a
distance of 200 metres.
Alphonse PÃ©naud, a Frenchman, advanced the theory of wing contours and
aerodynamics. He also constructed successful models of aeroplanes, helicopters
and ornithopters. In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed-wing
aeroplane, a model monoplane he called the "Planophore", a distance of 40Â m
(130Â ft). PÃ©naud's model incorporated several of Cayley's discoveries,
including the use of a tail, wing dihedral for inherent stability, and rubber
power. The planophore also had longitudinal stability, being trimmed such that
the tailplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings, an
original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics. PÃ©naud's
later project for an amphibian aeroplane, although never built, incorporated
other modern features. A tailless monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin
tractor propellers, it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces,
retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit.
Another theorist was Frenchman Victor Tatin. In 1879, he flew a model which,
like PÃ©naud's project, was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also
had a separate horizontal tail. It was powered by compressed air. Flown
tethered to a pole, this was the first model to take off under its own power.
In 1884, Alexandre Goupil published his work La Locomotion AÃ©rienne (Aerial
Locomotion), although the flying machine he later constructed failed to fly.
In 1890, the French engineer ClÃ©ment Ader completed the first of three
steam-driven flying machines, the Ãole. On 9 October 1890, Ader made an
uncontrolled hop of around 50 metres (160Â ft); this was the first manned
aeroplane to take off under its own power. His Avion III of 1897, notable only
for having twin steam engines, failed to fly: Ader later claimed success and
was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his
attempt.
Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own
whirling arm rig and wind tunnel and constructed a large machine with a
wingspan of 105 feet (32Â m), a length of 145 feet (44Â m), fore and aft
horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two
lightweight compound steam engines each delivering 180Â hp (130Â kW). The overall
weight was 8,000 pounds (3,600Â kg). It was intended as a test rig to
investigate aerodynamic lift; because it lacked flight controls it ran on
rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in
1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for about 200

refining and defining the modern aeroplane. Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft
work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot
constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly.
It is preserved in the Musee de l'Air, France, and is claimed to be the
earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.
The Englishman Horatio Phillips made key contributions to aerodynamics. He
conducted extensive wind tunnel research on aerofoil sections, proving the
principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings
underpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883 and 1886, the American John
Joseph Montgomery developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting
his own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift.
Otto Lilienthal became known as the "Glider King" or "Flying Man" of Germany.
He duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his
research in 1889 as Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation (Der Vogelflug als
Grundlage der Fliegekunst), which is seen as one of the most important works in
aviation history. He also produced a series of hang gliders, including
bat-wing, monoplane, and biplane forms, such as the Derwitzer Glider and Normal
soaring apparatus, which is considered to be the first airplane in series
production, making the "Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal" the first airplane
production company in the world.
Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered
glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air
machine, stimulating interest around the world. Lilienthal's work led to him
developing the concept of the modern wing. His flights in the year 1891 are
seen as the beginning of human flight and because of that he is often referred
to as either the "father of aviation" or "father of flight".
He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason
is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000
glider flights until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider
crash.`,length:2218,num_lines:31,location:"Aviation History",importance:.9,conflict:.1,characters:[{name:"Innovation In Aviation",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to the scene as it discusses key figures and their contributions to the development of flight.",emotion:"Inspired and pioneering",sentiment:1,quote:"Otto Lilienthal became known as the 'Glider King' or 'Flying Man' of Germany.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Pioneering Spirit",importance:1,importance_exp:"The theme reflects the determination and courage of early aviators in their quest for flight.",emotion:"Adventurous and determined",sentiment:1,quote:"Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered glides routinely.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Legacy Of Flight",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme highlights the lasting impact of early aviation pioneers on modern flight.",emotion:"Respectful and historical",sentiment:1,quote:"His flights in the year 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Chanute's Contributions",summary:"Octave Chanute's work on gliders.",chapter:"### Manned gliders and Otto Lilienthal",first_line:32,last_line:36,explanation:"Location changes to Chanute's workshop.",text:`Picking up where Lilienthal left off, Octave Chanute took up aircraft design

Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a number of sophisticated
devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested. As a
result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag
and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher
aspect ratio and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of

built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved
wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to
gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as
a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of
aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a
rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers
appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly
influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to
life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine
power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind.

original Flyer. On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the Flyer
III. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made
important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the elevator and
rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two
fixed vertical vanes (called "blinkers") between the elevators and gave the
wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the
wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate
control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious
pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so
repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III
started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first
practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device),

public flight had been made in the United States before its April 1907 issue.

Although the full details of the Wright Brothers' system of flight control had
been published in l'Aerophile in January 1906, the importance of this advance
was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on
attempting to produce inherently stable machines.
Short powered flights were performed in France by Romanian engineer Traian Vuia
on 18 March and 19 August 1906 when he flew 12 and 24 metres, respectively, in
a self-designed, fully self-propelled, fixed-wing aircraft, that possessed a
fully wheeled undercarriage. He was followed by Jacob Ellehammer who built a
monoplane which he tested with a tether in Denmark on 12 September 1906, flying
42 metres.
On 13 September 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made a public flight
in Paris with the 14-bis, also known as Oiseau de proie (French for "bird of
prey"). This was canard configured with a pronounced wing dihedral, and covered
a distance of 60Â m (200Â ft) on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in
Paris' Bois de Boulogne before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented
event was the first flight verified by the AÃ©ro-Club de France of a powered
heavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the
first officially observed flight greater than 25Â m (82Â ft). On 12 November
1906, Santos-Dumont set the first world record recognized by the Federation
Aeronautique Internationale by flying 220Â m (720Â ft) in 21.5Â seconds. Only one
more brief flight was made by the 14-bis in March 1907, after which it was
abandoned.`,length:1569,num_lines:23,location:"Chateau De Bagatelle",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Innovation And Experimentation",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to the advancements in aviation described in the scene.",emotion:"Excitement and Achievement",sentiment:1,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"The verification of the first powered flight in Europe signifies excitement and achievement in aviation history.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Recognition And Legacy",importance:.8,importance_exp:"The theme highlights the delayed recognition of significant advancements in aviation.",emotion:"Frustration and Overlooked Potential",sentiment:-.5,quote:"the importance of this advance was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on attempting to produce inherently stable machines.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Competition And Controversy",importance:.7,importance_exp:"The theme reflects the competitive nature of early aviation and the race for records.",emotion:"Determination and Rivalry",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Santos-Dumont's record flight exemplifies determination and rivalry in the race for aviation milestones.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Flight as an established technology",summary:"Development of flight technology and its recognition.",chapter:"### Pioneer Era (1903â1914)",first_line:32,last_line:68,explanation:"Location change to broader aviation advancements.",text:`#### Flight as an established technology
Santos-Dumont later added ailerons between the wings in an effort to gain more
lateral stability. His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of
Demoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The Demoiselle No 19 could be
constructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production
aircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120Â km/h. The fuselage consisted of three
specially reinforced bamboo booms. The pilot sat in a seat between the main
wheels of a conventional landing gear whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were
located at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back
beneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by
a cruciform tail unit hinged on a form of universal joint at the aft end of the
fuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control
provided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping "down".
In 1908, Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a
series of flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. The first demonstration,
made on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French
aviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the
Wright Brothers' aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled
turns. The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by
almost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his
Voisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction
business, whose first product was the influential Farman III biplane.
The following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as
something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics. On 25 July 1909,
Louis BlÃ©riot won worldwide fame by winning a Â£1,000 prize offered by the
British Daily Mail newspaper for a flight across the English Channel, and in
August around half a million people, including the President of France Armand
FalliÃ¨res and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George,
attended one of the first aviation meetings, the Grande Semaine d'Aviation at
Reims.
In 1914, pioneering aviator Tony Jannus captained the inaugural flight of the
St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, the world's first commercial passenger
airline.
Historians disagree about whether the Wright brothers patent war impeded
development of the aviation industry in the United States compared to Europe.
The patent war ended during World War I when the government pressured the
industry into forming a patent pool, and major litigants had left the industry.`,length:2638,num_lines:37,location:"Aviation History",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Technological Advancement",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to the scene as it discusses the evolution of flight technology.",emotion:"Innovative and transformative",sentiment:1,quote:"The Demoiselle No 19 could be constructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production aircraft.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Recognition And Legacy",importance:1,importance_exp:"The scene highlights the growing acceptance of flight as a legitimate endeavor.",emotion:"Celebratory and significant",sentiment:1,quote:"the widespread recognition of powered flight as something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Commercial Aviation",importance:1,importance_exp:"The establishment of commercial aviation marks a significant milestone in the aviation industry.",emotion:"Pioneering and groundbreaking",sentiment:1,quote:"the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, the world's first commercial passenger airline.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Rotorcraft",summary:"Early developments in helicopter technology.",chapter:"### Pioneer Era (1903â1914)",first_line:69,last_line:76,explanation:"Location change to rotorcraft innovations.",text:`#### Rotorcraft

Forlanini developed an unmanned helicopter powered by a steam engine. It rose

vertical take-off from a park in Milan. Milan has dedicated its city airport to

Almost as soon as they were invented, aeroplanes were used for military
purposes. The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose
aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya
during the Italian-Turkish war (September 1911 â October 1912). This war also
saw Ottoman soldiers shoot down a warplane for the first time in history. The
first warplane reconnaissance mission flown on 23 October 1911 by the Italian
air force's Captain Carlo Piazza, and the first bombing mission was flown on 1
November 1911 by Italy's Second Lieutenant Giolio Gavotti. Bulgaria later
followed this example. Its planes attacked and reconnoitred Ottoman positions
during the First Balkan War 1912â13. The first war to see major use of
aeroplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World
War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used aeroplanes and airships
extensively.
While the concept of using the aeroplane as an offensive weapon was generally
discounted before World War I, the idea of using it for photography was one
that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe
had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached
to their reconnaissance departments. Radiotelephones were also being explored
on aeroplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground
commander grew more and more important.`,length:1453,num_lines:21,location:"Aviation History",importance:.5,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Military Strategy",importance:1,importance_exp:"This theme is central to the scene as it discusses the military applications of aeroplanes.",emotion:"Strategic",sentiment:1,quote:"Almost as soon as they were invented, aeroplanes were used for military purposes.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Historical Significance",importance:1,importance_exp:"The theme highlights the historical context of aeroplane use in warfare.",emotion:"Reflective",sentiment:1,quote:"The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya during the Italian-Turkish war.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Technological Advancement",importance:1,importance_exp:"The theme emphasizes the technological developments in military aviation.",emotion:"Progressive",sentiment:1,quote:"Radiotelephones were also being explored on aeroplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:4,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Combat Schemes",summary:"Introduction to aerial combat innovations during WWI.",chapter:"### World War I (1914â1918)",first_line:1,last_line:20,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`#### Combat schemes
It was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of
any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this
problem when, in late 1914, Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the
front of his plane. Adolphe Pegoud became known as the first "ace", getting
credit for five victories before also becoming the first ace to die in action,
it was German LuftstreitkrÃ¤fte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens who, on 1 July 1915,
scored the very first aerial victory by a purpose-built fighter plane, with a
synchronized machine gun.
Aviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their
enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most
well known is Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the "Red Baron", who shot
down 80 planes in air-to-air combat with several different planes, the most
celebrated of which was the Fokker Dr.I. On the Allied side, RenÃ© Paul Fonck is
credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are
considered.
France, Britain, Germany, and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter
planes that saw action during the war, with German aviation technologist Hugo
Junkers showing the way to the future through his pioneering use of all-metal
aircraft from late 1915.`,length:1319,num_lines:20,location:"Aviation History",importance:.7,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Aerial Combat",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central focus of the scene is on aerial combat.",emotion:"Heroic and competitive",sentiment:1,quote:"Aviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their enemies.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Innovation In Warfare",importance:1,importance_exp:"The scene highlights technological advancements in combat.",emotion:"Progressive and transformative",sentiment:1,quote:"the French solved this problem when, in late 1914, Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Fame And Legacy",importance:1,importance_exp:"The scene discusses the recognition of pilots and their achievements.",emotion:"Admiration and respect",sentiment:1,quote:"Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most well known is Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the 'Red Baron', who shot down 80 planes in air-to-air combat.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Advancements in Aircraft Technology",summary:"Overview of aircraft evolution post-WWI.",chapter:"### Between the World Wars (1918â1939)",first_line:1,last_line:6,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`The years between World War I and World War II saw great advancements in

Large-scale strategic bombing campaigns were launched, fighter escorts
introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks
on small targets with dive bombers, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack
aircraft. New technologies like radar also allowed more coordinated and
controlled deployment of air defence.
The first jet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel He 178 (Germany), flown by Erich
Warsitz in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the
Messerschmitt Me 262, in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the
Arado Ar 234, in June 1943. British developments, like the Gloster Meteor,
followed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise
missile (V-1), the first ballistic missile (V-2), the first (and to date only)
operational rocket-powered combat aircraft Me 163âwhich attained velocities of
up to 1,130Â km/h (700Â mph) in test flightsâand the first vertical take-off a
manned point-defence interceptor, the Bachem Ba 349 Natter, were also developed
by Germany. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to
their late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the
declining war industry of Germany.
Not only aeroplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second

and more efficient flights.
The British de Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner and was
introduced into scheduled service by 1952. The aircraft was a breakthrough in
technical achievements, but had several intense failures. The square design of
the windows caused stress cracks from metal fatigue, caused by cycles of cabin
pressurization and depressurization. This eventually led to severe structural
failures in the fuel area. These issues were resolved too late, since competing
jet airliners were already flying.
On 15 September 1956, the USSR's airline AeroflotÂ became the first to offer
continuous, regular jet services using the Tupolev Tu-104. Soon after, Boeing
