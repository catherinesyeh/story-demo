home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing t'return t'his
wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, wh'had got him
int'a large cave and wanted t'marry him. But as years went by, there
came a time when the gods settled that he should g'back t'Ithaca;
even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were
not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun t'pity him
except Neptune, wh'still persecuted him without ceasing and would not
let him get home.
Now Neptune had gone off t'the Ethiopians, wh'are at the world's end,
and lie in tw'halves, the one looking West and the other East.1 He had
gone there t'accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying
himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of
Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment
he was thinking of Aegisthus, wh'had been killed by Agamemnon's son
Orestes; s'he said t'the other gods:
"See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing
but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to
Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew
it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury t'warn him not t'do
either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure t'take his
revenge when he grew up and wanted t'return home. Mercury told him
this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for
everything in full."
Then Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served
Aegisthus right, and s'it would any one else wh'does as he did; but
Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart
bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,
far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with
forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,
daughter of the magician Atlas, wh'looks after the bottom of the
ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth
asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,
and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment t'make him forget his
home, s'that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may
once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take n'heed of
this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you
with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being s'angry
with him?"
And Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget
Ulysses than whom there is n'more capable man on earth, nor more
liberal in his offerings t'the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear
in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having
blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to
Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter t'the sea-king Phorcys;
therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by
preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together
and see how we can help him t'return; Neptune will then be pacified,

Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily
among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would
send them flying out of the house, if he were t'come t'his own again

or a prisoner among savages wh'are detaining him against his will. I

But
tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking
fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head
and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where
the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never
either of us seen the other."
"My mother," answered Telemachus, "tells me I am son t'Ulysses, but it
is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son t'one
wh'had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is
n'more ill-starred man under heaven than he wh'they tell me is my
father."
And Minerva said, "There is n'fear of your race dying out yet, while
Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,
what is the meaning of all this feasting, and wh'are these people?
What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in
the family—for n'one seems t'be bringing any provisions of his own?
And the guests—how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make
over the whole house; it is enough t'disgust any respectable person
wh'comes near them."
"Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, s'long as my father
was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their
displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more
closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it
better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before
Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting
were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his
ashes, and I should myself have been heir t'his renown; but now the
storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone
without leaving s'much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing
but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of
my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the
chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island
of Zacynthus, as als'all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are
eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court t'my
mother, wh'will neither point blank say that she will not marry,7 nor
yet bring matters t'an end; s'they are making havoc of my estate, and
before long will d's'als'with myself."
"Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you d'indeed want Ulysses home
again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he
is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and
making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,
were he t'stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming
from Ephyra, where he had been t'beg poison for his arrows from Ilus,
son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give
him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him.
If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short
shrift and a sorry wedding.
"But there! It rests with heaven t'determine whether he is t'return,
and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you
t'set about trying t'get rid of these suitors at once. Take my
advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your
case before them, and call heaven t'bear you witness. Bid the suitors
take themselves off, each t'his own place, and if your mother's mind
is set on marrying again, let her g'back t'her father, wh'will find
her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that s'dear
a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you t'take
the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and g'in quest
of your father wh'has s'long been missing. Some one may tell you
something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some
heaven-sent message may direct you. First g't'Pylos and ask Nestor;
thence g'on t'Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all
the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way
home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet
another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come
home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a
barrow t'his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having
done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or
foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are to'old to
plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing
Orestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You
are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make
yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must g'back t'my ship and
t'my crew, wh'will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think
the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said t'you."`,length:4885,num_lines:74,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"He is the main character in this scene.",emotion:"Despair and frustration",sentiment:-.8,quote:"Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island of Zacynthus, as als'all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court t'my mother.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Minerva",importance:.8,importance_exp:"She provides guidance and support to Telemachus.",emotion:"Encouraging and assertive",sentiment:.7,quote:"But there!

come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very
good one, and I will give you one of n'less value in return."
With these words she flew away like a bird int'the air, but she had
given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about
his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the
stranger had been a god, s'he went straight t'where the suitors were
sitting.
Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he
told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had
laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song
from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not
alone, but attended by tw'of her handmaids. When she reached the
suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof
of the cloisters8 with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a
veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.
"Phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods and heroes,
such as poets love t'celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,
and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for
it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I
mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas
and middle Argos."9
"Mother," answered Telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a mind
to; bards d'not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who
makes them, and wh'sends weal or woe upon mankind according t'his own
good pleasure. This fellow means n'harm by singing the ill-fated
return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most
warmly. Make up your mind t'it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only
man wh'never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well
as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily
duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for
speech is man's matter, and mine above all others 10—for it is I wh'am
master here."
She went wondering back int'the house, and laid her son's saying in
her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids int'her room, she
mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.`,length:2819,num_lines:44,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Protective and assertive",sentiment:.5,quote:`"let the bard sing what he has a mind to; bards d'not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who makes them..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Minerva",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Encouraging and resolute",sentiment:.7,quote:`"D'not try t'keep me, for I would be on my way at once..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Penelope",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important character in this scene",emotion:"Sorrowful and longing",sentiment:-.7,quote:'"...for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing..."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Phemius",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Moderately important character in this scene",emotion:"Oblivious to the emotional turmoil",sentiment:.1,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Phemius continues to sing, unaware of the emotional distress he causes Penelope.",importance_rank:4}],number:10,importance_rank:9,conflict_rank:10},{title:"Telemachus' Ultimatum",summary:"Telemachus confronts the suitors about their behavior.",chapter:"BOOK I",first_line:267,last_line:277,explanation:"Location remains in Ithaca.",text:`But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters11, and

you."
Telemachus answered, "Antinous, d'not chide with me, but, god willing,
I will be chief to'if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of
for me? It is n'bad thing t'be a chief, for it brings both riches and
honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in

sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his

that looked on t'the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and
full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son
of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes
had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the

Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus
rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on t'his comely feet,
girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an
immortal god. He at once sent the criers round t'call the people in
assembly, s'they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,
when they were got together, he went t'the place of assembly spear in
hand—not alone, for his tw'hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him
with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as
he went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat even the
oldest councillors made way for him.
Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was
the first t'speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses t'Ilius,
land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they
were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.17
He had three sons left, of whom tw'still worked on their father's
land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless
their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still
weeping for him when he began his speech.
"Men of Ithaca," he said, "hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us
there has been n'meeting of our councillors until now; wh'then can it
be, whether old or young, that finds it s'necessary t'convene us? Has
he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish t'warn us, or
would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is
an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's
desire."
Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he
was bursting with what he had t'say. He stood in the middle of the
assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,
turning t'Aegyptius, "Sir," said he, "it is I, as you will shortly
learn, wh'have convened you, for it is I wh'am the most aggrieved. I
have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you,
nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My
grievance is purely personal, and turns on tw'great misfortunes which
have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my
excellent father, wh'was chief among all you here present, and was
like a father t'every one of you; the second is much more serious, and
ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief
men among you are pestering my mother t'marry them against her will.
They are afraid t'g't'her father Icarius, asking him t'choose the
one he likes best, and t'provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but
day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our
oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving s'much
as a thought t'the quantity of wine they drink. N'estate can stand
such recklessness; we have now n'Ulysses t'ward off harm from our
doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days
be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had
power t'd'so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house
is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, t'your own
consciences and t'public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest
the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and
Themis, wh'is the beginning and the end of councils, [d'not] hold
back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded18—unless it be that my
brave father Ulysses did some wrong t'the Achaeans which you would now
avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am
t'be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the
eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you t'some
purpose, and serve you with notices from house t'house till I got paid
in full, whereas now I have n'remedy."19
With this Telemachus dashed his staff t'the ground and burst into
tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no
one ventured t'make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, wh'spoke
thus:
"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try t'throw
the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for she
is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she
had been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us,
and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And
then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great
tambour frame in her room, and began t'work on an enormous piece of
fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead,
still d'not press me t'marry again immediately, wait—for I would not
have skill in needlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall
for the her'Laertes, t'be in readiness against the time when death
shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk
if he is laid out without a pall.'
"This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her
working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick
the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three
years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now
in her fourth year, one of her maids wh'knew what she was doing told
us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, s'she had to
finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you
this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand—'Send your
mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's
choice'; for I d'not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us
much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the
accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is s'clever.
We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena,
Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing t'your
mother any one of them. It was not fair of her t'treat us in that way,
and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now
endowed her, s'long shall we g'on eating up your estate; and I d'not
see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and glory, and
it is you wh'pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not
g'back t'our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her
choice and married some one or other of us."
Telemachus answered, "Antinous, how can I drive the mother wh'bore me
from my father's house? My father is abroad and we d'not know whether
he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have t'pay Icarius the
large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter
back t'him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will
als'punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on
the Erinyes t'avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing
t'do, and I will have nothing t'say t'it. If you choose t'take
offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's
houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you
elect t'persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove
shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house
there shall be n'man t'avenge you."
As he spoke Jove sent tw'eagles from the top of the mountain, and they
flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly
flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they
wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring
death int'the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely
and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the
town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what
all this might be; whereon Halitherses, wh'was the best prophet and
reader of omens among them, spoke t'them plainly and in all honesty,
saying:
"Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly t'the suitors,
for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going t'be away
much longer; indeed he is close at hand t'deal out death and
destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us wh'live in
Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop t'this wickedness
before he comes. Let the suitors d's'of their own accord; it will be
better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;
everything has happened t'Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set
out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much
hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the
twentieth year and that n'one would know him; and now all this is
coming true."
Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, "G'home, old man, and prophesy to
your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens
myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the
sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has
died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with
him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel t'the anger
of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he
will give you something for your family, but I tell you—and it shall
surely be—when an old man like you, wh'should know better, talks a
young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his
young friend will only fare s'much the worse—he will take nothing by
it, for the suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a
heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for
it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the
presence of you all t'send his mother back t'her father, wh'will
find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts s'dear
a daughter may expect. Till then we shall g'on harassing him with our
suit; for we fear n'man, and care neither for him, with all his fine
speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much
as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall g'back
and continue t'eat up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till
such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day
after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in
his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go
after the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the
way in which she treats us."
Then Telemachus said, "Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say
n'more, and entreat you n'further, for the gods and the people of
Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty
men t'take me hither and thither, and I will g't'Sparta and t'Pylos
in quest of my father wh'has s'long been missing. Some one may tell
me something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some
heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on
his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet
another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will
return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a
barrow t'his memory, and make my mother marry again."
With these words he sat down, and Mentor20 wh'had been a friend of
Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority
over the servants, rose t'speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty
addressed them thus:
"Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and
well-disposed ruler any more, nor one wh'will govern you equitably; I
hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for
there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, wh'ruled you as
though he were your father. I am not half s'angry with the suitors,
for if they choose t'd'violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,
and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the
high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at
the way in which you all sit still without even trying t'stop such
scandalous goings on—which you could d'if you chose, for you are many
and they are few."
Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, "Mentor, what folly is
all this, that you should set the people t'stay us? It is a hard thing
for one man t'fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses
himself were t'set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do
his best t'oust us, his wife, wh'wants him back s'very badly, would
have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own
head if he fought against such great odds. There is n'sense in what
you have been saying. Now, therefore, d'you people g'about your
business, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,
speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I d'not think
he will, for he is more likely t'stay where he is till some one comes
and tells him something."
On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back t'his own
abode, while the suitors returned t'the house of Ulysses.`,length:13114,num_lines:200,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character leading the assembly",emotion:"Determined and emotional",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus is determined and emotional as he addresses his personal grievances, highlighting the weight of his family's misfortunes.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Aegyptius",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Important as a speaker in the assembly",emotion:"Grieving and concerned",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Aegyptius is grieving and concerned as he reflects on the loss of his son, which deeply affects his ability to speak.",importance_rank:5},{name:"Antinous",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Key antagonist among the suitors",emotion:"Defensive and aggressive",sentiment:-.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Antinous feels defensive and aggressive as he reacts to Telemachus's accusations, trying to shift blame away from the suitors.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Eurymachus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Important as a suitor's voice against Telemachus",emotion:"Dismissive and confrontational",sentiment:-.6,quote:"G'home, old man, and prophesy to your own children, or it may be worse for them.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Halitherses",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Prophet warning the suitors",emotion:"Foreboding and serious",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Halitherses feels foreboding and serious as he predicts Ulysses's imminent return, suggesting danger for the suitors.",importance_rank:6},{name:"Mentor",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Supportive of Telemachus and critical of the suitors",emotion:"Indignant and disappointed",sentiment:-.4,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Mentor expresses indignation and disappointment, wishing ill upon the rulers of Ithaca due to their unjust governance.",importance_rank:4}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Telemachus' Decision",summary:"Telemachus decides to seek news of his father.",chapter:"BOOK II",first_line:201,last_line:332,explanation:"Location changes to the seaside and then to the ship.",text:`Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the
grey waves, and prayed t'Minerva.
"Hear me," he cried, "you god wh'visited me yesterday, and bade me
sail the seas in search of my father wh'has s'long been missing. I
would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked
suitors, are hindering me that I cannot d'so."
As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up t'him in the likeness and
with the voice of Mentor. "Telemachus," said she, "if you are made of
the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward
henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half
done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,
but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins
I see n'likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as
their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are
not going t'be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not
entirely without some share of your father's wise discernment, I look
with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause
with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor
virtue, and give n'thought t'death and t'the doom that will shortly
fall on one and all of them, s'that they shall perish on the same day.
As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such
an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with
you myself. Now, however, return home, and g'about among the suitors;
begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well
stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of
life, in leathern bags, while I g'round the town and beat up
volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I
will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get
her ready and will put out t'sea without delay."
Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost n'time in
doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the
suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous
came up t'him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,
saying, "Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear n'more ill blood neither
in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used t'do. The
Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and a picked crew to
boot—s'that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your
noble father."
"Antinous," answered Telemachus, "I cannot eat in peace, nor take
pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that
you should waste s'much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?
Now that I am older and know more about it, I am als'stronger, and
whether here among this people, or by going t'Pylos, I will d'you all
the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain—though,
thanks t'you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must
be passenger not captain."
As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the
others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings,21 jeering at
him tauntingly as they did so.
"Telemachus," said one youngster, "means t'be the death of us; I
suppose he thinks he can bring friends t'help him from Pylos, or again
from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he g't'Ephyra as
well, for poison t'put in our wine and kill us?"
Another said, "Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be
like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should
have plenty t'do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us:
as for the house we can let his mother and the man wh'marries her have
that."
This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down int'the lofty and
spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay
heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were
kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive
oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god
t'drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home
again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in
the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter
of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and
day. Telemachus called her t'the store-room and said:
"Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are
keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should
escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve
jars, and see that they all have lids; als'fill me some well-sewn
leathern bags with barley meal—about twenty measures in all. Get these
things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take
everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for
the night. I am going t'Sparta and t'Pylos t'see if I can hear
anything about the return of my dear father."
When Euryclea heard this she began t'cry, and spoke fondly t'him,
saying, "My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into
your head? Where in the world d'you want t'g'to—you, wh'are the one
hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign
country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these
wicked ones here will be scheming t'get you put out of the way, and
will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are
among your own people, and d'not g'wandering and worrying your life
out on the barren ocean."
"Fear not, nurse," answered Telemachus, "my scheme is not without
heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this
t'my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she
hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I d'not want her t'spoil
her beauty by crying."
The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had
completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine int'jars, and
getting the barley meal int'the bags, while Telemachus went back to
the suitors.
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and
went round the town t'each one of the crew, telling them t'meet at
the ship by sundown. She went als't'Noemon son of Phronius, and asked
him t'let her have a ship—which he was very ready t'do. When the sun
had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship int'the
water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and
stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up,
and the goddess spoke encouragingly t'each of them.
Furthermore she went t'the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors
int'a deep slumber. She caused their drink t'fuddle them, and made
them drop their cups from their hands, s'that instead of sitting over
their wine, they went back int'the town t'sleep, with their eyes
heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of
Mentor, and called Telemachus t'come outside.
"Telemachus," said she, "the men are on board and at their oars,
waiting for you t'give your orders, s'make haste and let us be off."
On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When
they got t'the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and
Telemachus said, "Now my men, help me t'get the stores on board; they
are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know
anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."
With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When
they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,
Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the
vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the
hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair
wind from the West,22 that whistled over the deep blue waves23 whereon
Telemachus told them t'catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and
they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross
plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they
hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the
sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue
water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then
they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls t'the
brim, and made drink offerings t'the immortal gods that are from
everlasting, but more particularly t'the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.
Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night`,length:8548,num_lines:132,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Main character seeking his father",emotion:"Determined and defiant",sentiment:.5,quote:'"I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of any kind with such men as you are."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Minerva",importance:1,importance_exp:"Goddess guiding Telemachus",emotion:"Supportive and encouraging",sentiment:.8,quote:'"If you are made of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Antinous",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Suitor trying to manipulate Telemachus",emotion:"Mocking and condescending",sentiment:-.5,quote:`"Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear n'more ill blood neither in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used t'do."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4},{name:"Euryclea",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Nurse concerned for Telemachus",emotion:"Worried and protective",sentiment:-.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Euryclea is worried and protective as she urges Telemachus to stay safe among his own people, fearing for his well-being.",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Telemachus Arrives at Pylos",summary:"Telemachus and his crew reach Pylos.",chapter:"BOOK III",first_line:1,last_line:10,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.

There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were
nine bulls t'each guild. As they were eating the inward meats25 and

assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth

She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till
they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were
assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his
company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of
meat on t'the spits26 while other pieces were cooking. When they saw
the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade
them take their places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered his
hand t'each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were
lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he

offering, pass the cup t'your friend that he may d's'also. I doubt
not that he to'lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without
God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an

As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and
proper of him t'have given it t'herself first;27 she accordingly
began praying heartily t'Neptune. "'thou," she cried, "that

people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering
you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of
the matter that has brought us in our ship t'Pylos."
When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to
Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were
roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man
his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had
had enough t'eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began t'speak.`,length:1416,num_lines:22,location:"Pylos",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Minerva",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Respectful and earnest",sentiment:.8,quote:"'thou,' she cried, 'that encirclest the earth, vouchsafe t'grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee.'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character in the scene",emotion:"Hopeful and earnest",sentiment:.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus participates in the prayer, showing his hope for a favorable outcome.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Nestor",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Somewhat important character in the scene",emotion:"Welcoming and gracious",sentiment:.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Nestor initiates the conversation after the meal, indicating his role as a host.",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Telemachus Asks About Ulysses",summary:"Telemachus inquires about his father Ulysses.",chapter:"BOOK III",first_line:57,last_line:80,explanation:"Telemachus asks Nestor about Ulysses.",text:`"Now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it will be

have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what
fate befell each one of the other heroes wh'fought at Troy, but as
regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is
dead at all, for n'one can certify us in what place he perished, nor
say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid
the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if
haply you may be pleased t'tell me of his melancholy end, whether you
saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for
he was a man born t'trouble. D'not soften things out of any pity for

privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of
king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there—Ajax, Achilles,
Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a
man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much
more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?
Though you were t'stay here and question me for five years, or even
six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would
turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we
try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us;

eyes—and you talk just like him too—n'one would say that people of
such different ages could speak s'much alike. He and I never had any
kind of difference from first t'last neither in camp nor council, but
in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might
be ordered for the best.
"When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail
in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit t'vex the
Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise
or understanding, and hence many came t'a bad end through the
displeasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, wh'brought about a quarrel
between the tw'sons of Atreus.
"The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for
it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they
explained why they had called the people together, it seemed that
Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased
Agamemnon, wh'thought that we should wait till we had offered
hecatombs t'appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might
have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have
made up their minds they d'not change them lightly. S'the tw'stood
bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang t'their feet with a
cry that rent the air, and were of tw'minds as t'what they should do.
"That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching
mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into
the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,
about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We—the other
half—embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had
smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices t'the
gods, for we were longing t'get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet
mean that we should d'so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of
which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away
under Ulysses t'make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the
ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was
brewing. The son of Tydeus went on als'with me, and his crews with
him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our
minds about our course—for we did not know whether t'g'outside Chios
by the island of Psyra, keeping this t'our left, or inside Chios, over
against the stormy headland of Mimas. S'we asked heaven for a sign,
and were shown one t'the effect that we should be soonest out of
danger if we headed our ships across the open sea t'Euboea. This we
therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage
during the night t'Geraestus,29 where we offered many sacrifices to
Neptune for having helped us s'far on our way. Four days later Diomed
and his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos,
and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it
fair for me.

about the others.

have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the
Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus; s'also
did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no
men at sea, and all his followers wh'escaped death in the field got
safe home with him t'Crete. N'matter how far out of the world you
live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came t'at
the hands of Aegisthus—and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently
pay. See what a good thing it is for a man t'leave a son behind him to
d'as Orestes did, wh'killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble
father. You too, then—for you are a tall smart-looking fellow—show your
mettle and make yourself a name in story."
"Nestor son of Neleus," answered Telemachus, "honour t'the Achaean
name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all
time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant
me t'd'like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, wh'are
ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have n'such
happiness in store for me and for my father, s'we must bear it as best
we may."
"My friend," said Nestor, "now that you remind me, I remember t'have
heard that your mother has many suitors, wh'are ill disposed towards
you and are making havoc of your estate. D'you submit t'this tamely,
or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Wh'knows
but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in
full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If
Minerva were t'take as great a liking t'you as she did t'Ulysses
when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so
openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she
would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would
soon some of them forget their wooing."
Telemachus answered, "I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far
to'much t'hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though
the gods themselves willed it n'such good fortune could befall me."
On this Minerva said, "Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven
has a long arm if it is minded t'save a man; and if it were me, I
should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I
could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home
quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the
treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when
a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, n'matter how
fond they are of him."
"Mentor," answered Telemachus, "d'not let us talk about it any more.
There is n'chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have long
since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,
about which I should like t'ask Nestor, for he knows much more than
any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so
that it is like talking t'an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and
tell me true; how did Agamemnon come t'die in that way? What was
Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus t'kill s'far better a
man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging
elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed
Agamemnon?"
"I will tell you truly," answered Nestor, "and indeed you have yourself
divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had
found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no
barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have
been thrown outside the city t'dogs and vultures, and not a woman
would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but
we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, wh'was
taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's wife
Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.
"At first she would have nothing t'd'with his wicked scheme, for she
was of a good natural disposition;30 moreover there was a bard with
her, t'whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,
that he was t'keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled
her destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off t'a desert island and
left him there for crows and seagulls t'batten upon—after which she
went willingly enough t'the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many
burnt sacrifices t'the gods, and decorated many temples with
tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his
expectations.
"Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms
with one another. When we got t'Sunium, which is the point of Athens,
Apoll'with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of
Menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how t'handle a vessel in
rough weather) s'that he died then and there with the helm in his
hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious t'press forward, had t'wait
in order t'bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.
Presently, when he to'could put t'sea again, and had sailed on as far
as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow
hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and
took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about
the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts
stretching out int'the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along
this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there
is a south wind blowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more
protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this
part of the fleet was driven on t'the rocks and wrecked; but the crews
just managed t'save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were
taken by winds and seas t'Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and
substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at
home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed
Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him,
but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens t'be his bane,
and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral
rites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet t'the people
of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home,31 with as much
treasure as his ships could carry.
"Take my advice then, and d'not g'travelling about for long s'far
from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your
house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will
have been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means
t'g'and visit Menelaus, wh'has lately come off a voyage among such
distant peoples as n'man could ever hope t'get back from, when the
winds had once carried him s'far out of his reckoning; even birds

seas that they must cross. G't'him, therefore, by sea, and take your

As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,
"Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues
of the victims t'be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings
t'Neptune, and the other immortals, and then g't'bed, for it is bed
time. People should g'away early and not keep late hours at a
religious festival."
Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men
servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled
the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving
every man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the
victims int'the fire, and stood up t'make their drink offerings. When
they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was
minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship, but
Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.
"Heaven and the immortal gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that you should
leave my house t'g'on board of a ship. D'you think I am s'poor and
short of clothes, or that I have s'few cloaks and as t'be unable to
find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell
you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son
of my old friend Ulysses t'camp down on the deck of a ship—not while I
live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I
have done."
Then Minerva answered, "Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much
better that Telemachus should d'as you have said; he, therefore, shall
return with you and sleep at your house, but I must g'back t'give
orders t'my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older
person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' own age,
wh'have taken this voyage out of friendship; s'I must return t'the

Nestor was astonished, and took
Telemachus by the hand. "My friend," said he, "I see that you are going
t'be a great her'some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while
you are still s'young. This can have been none other of those who
dwell in heaven than Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who
shewed such favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy
queen," he continued, "vouchsafe t'send down thy grace upon myself, my
good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a
broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by
man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up t'you
in sacrifice."
Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to
his own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got
there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed
them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the
housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the
wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings t'Minerva, daughter of
Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink offerings and
had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home t'bed
each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus t'sleep in the room
that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, wh'was the only
unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room
of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.
Now when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left
his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble
that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of
gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone t'the house of
Hades; s'Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the
public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,
Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son
was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with
them. Nestor then addressed them.
"My sons," said he, "make haste t'd'as I shall bid you. I wish first
and foremost t'propitiate the great goddess Minerva, wh'manifested
herself visibly t'me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or
other of you t'the plain, tell the stockman t'look me out a heifer,
and come on here with it at once. Another must g't'Telemachus' ship,
and invite all the crew, leaving tw'men only in charge of the vessel.
Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith t'gild the
horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the
maids in the house t'prepare an excellent dinner, and t'fetch seats,
and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them als't'bring me some
clear spring water."
On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was
brought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship;
the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he
worked his gold, and Minerva herself came t'accept the sacrifice.
Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer
that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and
Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the
house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand
he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a
sharp axe, ready t'strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.
Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley
meal, and he offered many a prayer t'Minerva as he threw a lock from
the heifer's head upon the fire.
When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal32 Thrasymedes
dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut
through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and
daughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was
eldest daughter t'Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted
the heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat.
When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They
cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two
layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then
Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while
the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.
When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they
cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and
toasted them over the fire.
Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed
Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she
brought him a fair mantle and shirt,33 and he looked like a god as he
came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the
outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to`,length:4928,num_lines:75,location:"Pylos",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Nestor",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character leading the scene",emotion:"Respectful and pious",sentiment:.9,quote:"My friend, said he, I see that you are going t'be a great her'some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still s'young.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Significant character receiving guidance",emotion:"Awed and honored",sentiment:.8,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus feels honored and awed by Nestor's words and the divine favor he perceives.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Pisistratus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Important supporting character assisting Nestor",emotion:"Dutiful and respectful",sentiment:.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Pisistratus shows respect and duty as he assists in the rituals and preparations.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Minerva",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Divine presence influencing the scene",emotion:"Gracious and approving",sentiment:.9,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Minerva's presence is felt as a blessing upon the proceedings, indicating her approval.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Eurydice",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Supporting character showing familial support",emotion:"Joyful and proud",sentiment:.8,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Eurydice expresses joy and pride in the family rituals and the honor bestowed upon them.",importance_rank:5}],number:8,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:8},{title:"Telemachus Departs for Lacedaemon",summary:"Telemachus sets off for Lacedaemon with Pisistratus.",chapter:"BOOK III",first_line:361,last_line:380,explanation:"Telemachus leaves Pylos for Lacedaemon.",text:`dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, wh'kept

fleet horses t'the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision

they reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove
straight t'the abode of Menelaus36 [and found him in his own house,
feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,
and als'of his daughter, whom he was marrying t'the son of that
valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to
him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the
marriage about; s'he was sending her with chariots and horses t'the
city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning. For his
only son he had found a bride from Sparta,37 the daughter of Alector.
This son, Megapenthes, was born t'him of a bondwoman, for heaven
vouchsafed Helen n'more children after she had borne Hermione, wh'was
fair as golden Venus herself.
S'the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making
merry in his house. There was a bard als't'sing t'them and play his
lyre, while tw'tumblers went about performing in the midst of them
when the man struck up with his tune.38
Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,
whereon Eteoneus servant t'Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw
them ran hurrying back int'the house t'tell his Master. He went close
up t'him and said, "Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two
men, wh'look like sons of Jove. What are we t'do? Shall we take their
horses out, or tell them t'find friends elsewhere as they best can?"
Menelaus was very angry and said, "Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never
used t'be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses
out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;
you and I have staid often enough at other people's houses before we
got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace
henceforward."
S'Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.
They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to
the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they
leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the
way int'the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when
they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then,
when they had admired everything t'their heart's content, they went
int'the bath room and washed themselves.
When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they
brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the tw'took their seats by
the side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful
golden ewer, and poured it int'a silver basin for them t'wash their
hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought
them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the
house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and
set cups of gold by their side.
Menelaus then greeted them saying, "Fall to, and welcome; when you have
done supper I shall ask wh'you are, for the lineage of such men as you
cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of
sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people d'not have such sons as you
are."
On this he handed them39 a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set
near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good
things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough t'eat and
drink, Telemachus said t'the son of Nestor, with his head s'close
that n'one might hear, "Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see
the gleam of bronze and gold—of amber,40 ivory, and silver. Everything
is s'splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am
lost in admiration."
Menelaus overheard him and said, "N'one, my sons, can hold his own
with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but
among mortal men—well, there may be another wh'has as much wealth as I
have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and
have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I
could get home with my fleet. I went t'Cyprus, Phoenicia and the
Egyptians; I went als't'the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the
Erembians, and t'Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are
born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that
country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good
milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling
and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly
and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, s'that
I have n'pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your
parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy
loss in the ruin41 of a stately mansion fully and magnificently
furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have s'that I
had stayed at home, and all those were living wh'perished on the plain
of Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for
one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I
leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it.
Yet grieve for these as I may, I d's'for one man more than for them
all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep,
s'miserable does he make me, for n'one of all the Achaeans worked so
hard or risked s'much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a
legacy of sorrow t'myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we
know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his
long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left
behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account."
Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he
bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him
thus mentioned, s'that he held his cloak before his face with both
hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether t'let him choose his
own time for speaking, or t'ask him at once and find what it was all
about.
While he was thus in tw'minds Helen came down from her high vaulted
and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought
her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phyl'fetched her the
silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus
lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;
he gave Menelaus tw'baths, both of pure silver, tw'tripods, and ten
talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful
presents, t'wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on
wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phyl'now placed this by
her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet
coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat,
put her feet upon the footstool, and began t'question her husband.42
"D'we know, Menelaus," said she, "the names of these strangers who
have come t'visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help
saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman s'like
somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what t'think)
as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby
behind him, when you Achaeans went t'Troy with battle in your hearts,
on account of my most shameless self."
"My dear wife," replied Menelaus, "I see the likeness just as you do.
His hands and feet are just like Ulysses; s'is his hair, with the
shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was
talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my
account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle."
Then Pisistratus said, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in
thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and
is ashamed t'come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose
conversation is s'divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,
sent me t'escort him hither, for he wanted t'know whether you could
give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home
when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this
is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is
n'one among his own people t'stand by him."
"Bless my heart," replied Menelaus, "then I am receiving a visit from
the son of a very dear friend, wh'suffered much hardship for my sake.
I had always hoped t'entertain him with most marked distinction when
heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have
founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have
made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and
should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that
are subject t'me. We should thus have seen one another continually,
and nothing but death could have interrupted s'close and happy an
intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good
fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at
all."
Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,
Telemachus wept, and s'did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his
eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom
the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said t'Menelaus,
"Sir, my father Nestor, when we used t'talk about you at home, told me
you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be
possible, d'as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am
getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon
I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all
we can d'for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and
wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother wh'died at Troy; he
was by n'means the worst man there; you are sure t'have known him—his
name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say
that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant."
"Your discretion, my friend," answered Menelaus, "is beyond your years.
It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is
son t'one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and
offspring—and it has blessed Nestor from first t'last all his days,
giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who
are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore t'all
this weeping, and attend t'our supper again. Let water be poured over
our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the
morning."
On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands
and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.
Then Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged
the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.
Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest
of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop
down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very
eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to
Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all
sorts of herbs, some good t'put int'the mixing bowl and others
poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled
physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this
drug in the bowl, and had told the servants t'serve the wine round,
she said:
"Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable
men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,
and can d'what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I
tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the
exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,
and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself
with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the
enemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different
from what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he
entered the city of Troy, and n'one said anything t'him. I alone
recognised him and began t'question him, but he was to'cunning for
me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him
clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not t'betray him t'the
Trojans till he had got safely back t'his own camp and t'the ships,
he told me all that the Achaeans meant t'do. He killed many Trojans
and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all
which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I
was glad, for my heart was beginning t'yearn after my home, and I was
unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,
away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, wh'is
indeed by n'means deficient either in person or understanding."
Then Menelaus said, "All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is
true. I have travelled much, and have had much t'd'with heroes, but I
have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and
what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the
bravest of the Argives were lying in wait t'bring death and
destruction upon the Trojans.43 At that moment you came up t'us; some
god wh'wished well t'the Trojans must have set you on t'it and you
had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you g'all round our hiding
place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and
mimicked all our wives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside
heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds
whether t'spring out then and there, or t'answer you from inside, but
Ulysses held us all in check, s'we sat quite still, all except
Anticlus, wh'was beginning t'answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two
brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that
saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away
again."
"How sad," exclaimed Telemachus, "that all this was of n'avail t'save
him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased t'send us
all t'bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep."
On this Helen told the maid servants t'set beds in the room that was
in the gatehouse, and t'make them with good red rugs, and spread
coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to
wear. S'the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to
which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did
Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son
of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.`,length:14699,num_lines:224,location:"Lacedaemon",importance:.9,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Menelaus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Reflective and sorrowful",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for one and all of them.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Yearning and emotional",sentiment:-.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus feels yearning and emotional as he is moved to tears by the mention of his father, revealing his deep longing.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Helen",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important character providing context",emotion:"Nostalgic and reflective",sentiment:-.4,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Helen feels nostalgic and reflective as she observes the resemblance between Telemachus and his father, stirring memories.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Pisistratus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Moderately important character",emotion:"Respectful and supportive",sentiment:.2,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Pisistratus is respectful and supportive, acknowledging Telemachus's modesty in the presence of a great leader.",importance_rank:4}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Telemachus' Inquiry",summary:"Telemachus asks Menelaus about his father Ulysses.",chapter:"BOOK IV",first_line:225,last_line:440,explanation:"Change of focus to Telemachus' quest.",text:`When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose
and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on t'his comely feet, girded
his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an
immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:
"And what, Telemachus, has led you t'take this long sea voyage to
Lacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about
it."
"I have come, sir," replied Telemachus, "t'see if you can tell me
anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my
fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who
keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of
paying their addresses t'my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your
knees if haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end,
whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other
traveller; for he was a man born t'trouble. D'not soften things out
of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you
saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by
word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it
in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."
Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. "So," he exclaimed,
"these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay
her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then g'off t'feed in
the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back t'his
lair will make short work with the pair of them—and s'will Ulysses
with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is
still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in
Lesbos, and threw him s'heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him—if
he is still such and were t'come near these suitors, they would have a
short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I
will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without
concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.
"I was trying t'come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for
my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are
very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a
ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an
island called Pharos—it has a good harbour from which vessels can get
out int'open sea when they have taken in water—and here the gods
becalmed me twenty days without s'much as a breath of fair wind to
help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men
would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved
me in the person of Idothea, daughter t'Proteus, the old man of the
sea, for she had taken a great fancy t'me.
"She came t'me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the
men used t'g'with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope
of catching a fish or tw't'save them from the pangs of hunger.
'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems t'me that you like starving in this
way—at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day
after day, without even trying t'get away though your men are dying by
inches.'
"'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may happen
t'be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have
offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods
know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in
this way, and tell me als'how I may sail the sea s'as t'reach my
home.'
"'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear t'you. There
is an old immortal wh'lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is
Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is
Neptune's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom
of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you
about your voyage, what courses you are t'take, and how you are to
sail the sea s'as t'reach your home. He will als'tell you, if you so
will, all that has been going on at your house both good and bad, while
you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.'
"'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I may
catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a
god is not easily caught—not by a mortal man.'
"'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear t'you. About
the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the
sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs
the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and
goes t'sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals—Halosydne's chickens
as they call them—come up als'from the grey sea, and g't'sleep in
shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell d'they
bring with them. 44 Early to-morrow morning I will take you t'this
place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best
men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the
old man will play you.
"'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he
has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will g't'sleep
among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he
is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for
he will d'his very utmost t'get away from you. He will turn himself
int'every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become
als'both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him
tighter and tighter, till he begins t'talk t'you and comes back to
what he was when you saw him g't'sleep; then you may slacken your
hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that
is angry with you, and what you must d't'reach your home over the
seas.'
"Having s'said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back t'the
place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was
clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper
ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.
"When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the
three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went
along by the sea-side, praying heartily t'heaven. Meanwhile the
goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all
of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father.
Then she dug four pits for us t'lie in, and sat down t'wait till we
should come up. When we were close t'her, she made us lie down in the
pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our
ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy
seals was most distressing45—wh'would g't'bed with a sea monster if
he could help it?—but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of
something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under
each man's nostrils, which was s'fragrant that it killed the smell of
the seals.46
"We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the
seals come up in hundreds t'bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the
old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he
went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,
and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down t'sleep as
soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and
seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed
himself first int'a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he
became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running
water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck t'him and
never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became
distressed, and said, 'Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that
hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my
will? What d'you want?'
"'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain nothing
by trying t'put me off. It is because I have been kept s'long in this
island, and see n'sign of my being able t'get away. I am losing all
heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the
immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me als'how I may sail
the sea s'as t'reach my home?'
"Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,
you must offer sacrifices t'Jove and t'the rest of the gods before
embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back t'your
friends, and t'your own house, till you have returned t'the
heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs t'the immortal
gods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you
finish your voyage.'
"I was broken hearted when I heard that I must g'back all that long
and terrible voyage t'Egypt;47 nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do
all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me
true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we
set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them
came t'a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends
when the days of his fighting were done.'
"'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not know
what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard
my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many
still remain, and only tw'of the chief men among the Achaeans perished
during their return home. As for what happened on the field of
battle—you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,
alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove
him on t'the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe
out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred he would have
escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the
gods could not drown him even though they had tried t'd'so, and when
Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his tw'brawny
hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in tw'pieces. The base remained
where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into
the sea and carried Ajax with it; s'he drank salt water and was
drowned.
"'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Jun'protected him, but when
he was just about t'reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught
by a heavy gale which carried him out t'sea again sorely against his
will, and drove him t'the foreland where Thyestes used t'dwell, but
where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as
though he was t'return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind
int'its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed
his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own
country.
"'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and
t'whom he had promised tw'talents of gold. This man had been looking
out for a whole year t'make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the
slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon g'by, he
went and told Aegisthus, wh'at once began t'lay a plot for him. He
picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on
one side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a
banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen t'Agamemnon, and
invited him t'the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all
unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the
banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles;
not one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of
Aegisthus', but they were all killed there in the cloisters.'
"Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat
down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could n'longer bear
t'live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had
my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea
said, 'Son of Atreus, d'not waste any more time in crying s'bitterly;
it can d'n'manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you
can, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been
beforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his
funeral.'
"On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I know,
then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom
you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable t'get home? or is
he dead? Tell me, n'matter how much it may grieve me.'
"'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses wh'dwells in Ithaca. I can
see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph
Calypso, wh'is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for
he has n'ships nor sailors t'take him over the sea. As for your own
end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you
t'the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There
fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any
where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail,
nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly
from the sea, and gives fresh life t'all men. This will happen t'you
because you have married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law.'
"As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back t'the
ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went
along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was
falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,
rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships int'the water, and put
our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took
our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again
stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered
hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased
heaven's anger, I raised a barrow t'the memory of Agamemnon that his
name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for
the gods sent me a fair wind.`,length:13992,num_lines:216,location:"Lacedaemon",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Menelaus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"shocked and concerned",sentiment:-.5,quote:`"So," he exclaimed, "these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed?"`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"desperate and hopeful",sentiment:-.3,quote:`"I have come, sir," replied Telemachus, "t'see if you can tell me anything about my father."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Proteus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character providing crucial information",emotion:"informative but distant",sentiment:.2,quote:`"If you would finish your voyage and get home quickly, you must offer sacrifices t'Jove and t'the rest of the gods before embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back t'your friends..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Suitors' Plot",summary:"The suitors in Ithaca plot against Telemachus.",chapter:"BOOK IV",first_line:441,last_line:640,explanation:"Shift to the suitors' actions in Ithaca.",text:`"And now for yourself—stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I

chariot and three horses. I will als'give you a beautiful chalice that
s'long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a
drink-offering t'the immortal gods."
"Son of Atreus," replied Telemachus, "d'not press me t'stay longer; I
should be contented t'remain with you for another twelve months; I
find your conversation s'delightful that I should never once wish
myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos
are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any
present you may be disposed t'make me, I had rather that it should be
a piece of plate. I will take n'horses back with me t'Ithaca, but
will leave them t'adorn your own stables, for you have much flat
ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as als'meadow-sweet and
wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas
in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country
is more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that.
48 None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and
Ithaca least of all."
Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. "What you
say," said he, "shows that you come of good family. I both can, and
will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most
precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by
Vulcan's own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with
gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a
visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.
I will make you a present of it."
Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming t'the king's house.
They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for
them t'take with them; s'they were busy cooking their dinners in the
courts].49
Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a
mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and were
behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who
were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were
sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to
Antinous,
"Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?
He has a ship of mine, and I want it, t'cross over t'Elis: I have
twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet
broken in, and I want t'bring one of them over here and break him."
They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that
Telemachus had not gone t'the city of Neleus. They thought he was only
away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the
swineherd; s'Antinous said, "When did he go? Tell me truly, and what
young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own
bondsmen—for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him
have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he
take it without your leave?"
"I lent it him," answered Noemon, "what else could I d'when a man of
his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me t'oblige him? I
could not possibly refuse. As for those wh'went with him they were the
best young men we have, and I saw Mentor g'on board as captain—or some
god wh'was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor
here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for
Pylos."
Noemon then went back t'his father's house, but Antinous and
Eurymachus were very angry. They told the others t'leave off playing,
and t'come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,
Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with
rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:
"Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we
had made sure that it would come t'nothing, but the young fellow has
got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving
us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find
me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait
for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the
day that he set out t'try and get news of his father."
Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all
of them went inside the buildings.
It was not long ere Penelope came t'know what the suitors were
plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the
outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went t'tell
his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:
"Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it t'tell the
maids t'leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish
they may neither wo'nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere
else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of
my son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children,
how good Ulysses had been t'them—never doing anything high-handed, nor
speaking harshly t'anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they
may take a fancy t'one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did
an unjust thing by anybody—which shows what bad hearts you have, and
that there is n'such thing as gratitude left in this world."
Then Medon said, "I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are
plotting something much more dreadful now—may heaven frustrate their
design. They are going t'try and murder Telemachus as he is coming
home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been t'get news of his
father."
Then Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was
speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no
utterance. At last, however, she said, "Why did my son leave me? What
business had he t'g'sailing off in ships that make long voyages over
the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want t'die without leaving any one
behind him t'keep up his name?"
"I d'not know," answered Medon, "whether some god set him on t'it, or
whether he went on his own impulse t'see if he could find out if his
father was dead, or alive and on his way home."
Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.
There were plenty of seats in the house, but she had n'heart for
sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor
of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old
and young, gathered round her and began t'cry too, till at last in a
transport of sorrow she exclaimed,
"My dears, heaven has been pleased t'try me with more affliction than
any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and
lion-hearted husband, wh'had every good quality under heaven, and
whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my
darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having
heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one
of you would s'much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though
you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he
meant taking this voyage, he would have had t'give it up, n'matter
how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him—one or
other. Now, however, g'some of you and call old Dolius, wh'was given
me by my father on my marriage, and wh'is my gardener. Bid him g'at
once and tell everything t'Laertes, wh'may be able t'hit on some
plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who
are trying t'exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses."
Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, "You may kill me, Madam, or let
me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the
real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in
the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I
would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you
asked or happened t'hear of his having gone, for he did not want you
t'spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change
your dress, and g'upstairs with your maids t'offer prayers to
Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even
though he be in the jaws of death. D'not trouble Laertes: he has
trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the
race of the son of Arceisius s'much, but there will be a son left to
come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that
lie far all round it."
With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the
tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and
went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley int'a
basket and began praying t'Minerva.
"Hear me," she cried, "Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If
ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or
heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son
from the villainy of the suitors."
She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;
meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,
and one of them said:
"The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.
Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed t'die."
This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to
happen. Then Antinous said, "Comrades, let there be n'loud talking,
lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and d'that in
silence, about which we are all of a mind."
He then chose twenty men, and they went down t'their ship and t'the
sea side; they drew the vessel int'the water and got her mast and
sails inside her; they bound the oars t'the thole-pins with twisted
thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,
while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the
ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and
waited till night should fall.
But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable t'eat or drink, and
wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the
wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen
hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into
a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the
likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius wh'had
married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision t'g't'the
house of Ulysses, and t'make Penelope leave off crying, s'it came
int'her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the
door to, and hovered over her head saying,
"You are asleep, Penelope: the gods wh'live at ease will not suffer
you t'weep and be s'sad. Your son has done them n'wrong, s'he will
yet come back t'you."
Penelope, wh'was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,
"Sister, why have you come here? You d'not come very often, but I
suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to
leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?
I, wh'have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, wh'had every good
quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and
middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship—a
foolish fellow wh'has never been used t'roughing it, nor t'going
about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than
about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest
something should happen t'him, either from the people among whom he
has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies wh'are plotting against
him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home."
Then the vision said, "Take heart, and be not s'much dismayed. There
is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough t'have stand
by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she wh'has compassion upon you, and
wh'has sent me t'bear you this message."
"Then," said Penelope, "if you are a god or have been sent here by
divine commission, tell me als'about that other unhappy one—is he
still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?"
And the vision said, "I shall not tell you for certain whether he is
alive or dead, and there is n'use in idle conversation."
Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated
int'thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and
comforted, s'vivid had been her dream.
Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea,
intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called
Asteris, of n'great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and
there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie.

And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light
alike t'mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them,
Jove the lord of thunder, wh'is their king. Thereon Minerva began to
tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away
there in the house of the nymph Calypso.
"Father Jove," said she, "and all you other gods that live in
everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and
well-disposed ruler any more, nor one wh'will govern equitably. I hope
they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of
his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, wh'ruled them as though he
were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where
dwells the nymph Calypso, wh'will not let him go; and he cannot get
back t'his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to
take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to
murder his only son Telemachus, wh'is coming home from Pylos and
Lacedaemon, where he has been t'see if he can get news of his father."
"What, my dear, are you talking about?" replied her father, "did you
not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses
t'get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to
protect Telemachus, and t'see him safely home again, while the suitors
have t'come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him."
When he had thus spoken, he said t'his son Mercury, "Mercury, you are
our messenger, g'therefore and tell Calyps'we have decreed that poor
Ulysses is t'return home. He is t'be convoyed neither by gods nor
men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to
reach fertile Scheria,50 the land of the Phaeacians, wh'are near of
kin t'the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of
ourselves. They will send him in a ship t'his own country, and will
give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought
back from Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home
without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to

There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and
one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal
wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden
shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there
was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,
wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests—owls, hawks, and
chattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine
loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of
the cave; there were als'four running rills of water in channels cut
pretty close together, and turned hither and thither s'as t'irrigate
the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. 51
Even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so
Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it
sufficiently he went inside the cave.
Calyps'knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, n'matter
how far they live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was
on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears
in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calyps'gave
Mercury a seat and said: "Why have you come t'see me,
Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you d'not visit me often? Say
what you want; I will d'it for you at once if I can, and if it can be
done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you."
As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed
him some red nectar, s'Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,
and then said:
"We are speaking god and goddess t'one another, and you ask me why I
have come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove
sent me; it was n'doing of mine; wh'could possibly want t'come all
this way over the sea where there are n'cities full of people t'offer
me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had t'come, for none
of us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says
that you have here the most ill-starred of all those wh'fought nine
years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year
after having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against
Minerva,52 wh'raised both wind and waves against them, s'that all his
brave companions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and
tide. Jove says that you are t'let this man g'at once, for it is
decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but
shall return t'his house and country and see his friends again."
Calyps'trembled with rage when she heard this, "You gods," she
exclaimed, "ought t'be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous
and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy t'a mortal man, and live with
him in open matrimony. S'when rosy-fingered Dawn made love t'Orion,
you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed
him in Ortygia. S'again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and
yielded t'him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came t'hear of
it before s'very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now
you are angry with me to'because I have a man here. I found the poor
creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his
ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, s'that all his crew were
drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on t'my island.
I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him
immortal, s'that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot
cross Jove, nor bring his counsels t'nothing; therefore, if he insists
upon it, let the man g'beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him
anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men wh'can take him.

will be likely t'bring him safely t'his own country."`,length:3891,num_lines:58,location:"Ogygian Island",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Calypso",importance:1,importance_exp:"Calyps is central to the conflict.",emotion:"Angry and frustrated",sentiment:-.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Calypso is angry and frustrated with the gods, feeling wronged by their treatment of her and Odysseus.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Mercury",importance:1,importance_exp:"Mercury delivers Jove's message.",emotion:"Neutral and formal",sentiment:.2,quote:"Jove sent me; it was n'doing of mine; wh'could possibly want t'come all this way over the sea?",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Odysseus",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Ulysses is the subject of the discussion.",emotion:"Sorrowful and longing",sentiment:-.6,quote:"he was on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Ulysses on the Shore",summary:"Calypsos finds Ulysses grieving on the shore.",chapter:"BOOK V",first_line:105,last_line:120,explanation:"Location changes to the shore where Ulysses is.",text:`On this he took his leave, and Calyps'went out t'look for Ulysses,

Ulysses followed in her steps; s'the pair, goddess and man, went on

that Mercury had just left. Calyps'set meat and drink before him of
the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar
for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were
before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,
Calyps'spoke, saying:
"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, s'you would start home t'your own
land at once? Good luck g'with you, but if you could only know how
much suffering is in store for you before you get back t'your own
country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and
let me make you immortal, n'matter how anxious you may be t'see this
wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet
I flatter myself that I am n'whit less tall or well-looking than she
is, for it is not t'be expected that a mortal woman should compare in
beauty with an immortal."
"Goddess," replied Ulysses, "d'not be angry with me about this. I am
quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like s'tall or so
beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an
immortal. Nevertheless, I want t'get home, and can think of nothing
else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and
make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea
already, s'let this g'with the rest."
Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into
the inner part of the cave and went t'bed.
When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on
his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer
fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about
her waist and a veil t'cover her head. She at once set herself to
think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. S'she gave him a great
bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and
had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on t'it. She als'gave
him a sharp adze, and then led the way t'the far end of the island
where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached the
sky—very dry and well seasoned, s'as t'sail light for him in the
water.53 Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew,
Calyps'went home, leaving him t'cut them, which he soon finished
doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring
them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calyps'came back
with some augers, s'he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers
together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled
shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top
of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He als'made a mast with a
yard arm, and a rudder t'steer with. He fenced the raft all round with
wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw on
a quantity of wood. By and by Calyps'brought him some linen t'make
the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with
braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the
raft down int'the water.`,length:3237,num_lines:50,location:"Ogygian Island",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Calypso",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Very important character guiding Ulysses",emotion:"determined and persuasive",sentiment:.5,quote:"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, s'you would start home t'your own land at once?

reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go
the helm, and the force of the hurricane was s'great that it broke the
mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over int'the sea. For a
long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could d't'rise
t'the surface again, for the clothes Calyps'had given him weighed him
down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter
brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,
however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he
could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again s'as to
escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn
winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though
the South, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and
shuttlecock with it at once.
When he was in this plight, In'daughter of Cadmus, als'called
Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been
since raised t'the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great
distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like
a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.
"My poor good man," said she, "why is Neptune s'furiously angry with
you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster
he will not kill you. You seem t'be a sensible person, d'then as I
bid you; strip, leave your raft t'drive before the wind, and swim to

veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to
n'harm s'long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off,
throw it back as far as you can int'the sea, and then g'away again."
With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived
down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.
But Ulysses did not know what t'think. "Alas," he said t'himself in
his dismay, "this is only some one or other of the gods wh'is luring
me t'ruin by advising me t'quit my raft. At any rate I will not d'so
at present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all
troubles seemed t'be still a good way off. I know what I will do—I am
sure it will be best—n'matter what happens I will stick t'the raft as

"Hear me, 'King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the

his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my

suppliant."
Then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm
before him, and bringing him safely int'the mouth of the river. Here
at last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had
completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and
nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, s'that he could neither
breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,
when he had got his breath and came t'himself again, he took off the
scarf that In'had given him and threw it back int'the salt54 stream

In the end he deemed it best t'take t'the woods, and he found one
upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath
tw'shoots of olive that grew from a single stock—the one an ungrafted

about—enough t'make a covering for tw'or three men even in hard

S'here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off
t'the country and city of the Phaeacians—a people wh'used t'live in
the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes
were stronger than they and plundered them, s'their king Nausithous
moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other
people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,
and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone t'the
house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired of
heaven, was now reigning. T'his house, then, did Minerva hie in
furtherance of the return of Ulysses.
She went straight t'the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there
slept a girl wh'was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter t'King
Alcinous. Tw'maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,
one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made
folding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's
daughter, wh'was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;
then, coming up t'the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she
hovered over her head and said:
"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, t'have such a lazy
daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are
going t'be married almost immediately, and should not only be well
dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those wh'attend
you. This is the way t'get yourself a good name, and t'make your
father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a
washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you s'that
you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best
young men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going
t'remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, t'have a
waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, t'take the rugs, robes, and
girdles, and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you
than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town."
When she had said this Minerva went away t'Olympus, which they say is
the everlasting home of the gods. Here n'wind beats roughly, and
neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine
and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are
illumined for ever and ever. This was the place t'which the goddess

father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her
mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her
maids around her, and she happened t'catch her father just as he was
going out t'attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian
aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:
"Papa dear, could you manage t'let me have a good big waggon? I want
t'take all our dirty clothes t'the river and wash them. You are the
chief man here, s'it is only right that you should have a clean shirt
when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons
at home, tw'of them married, while the other three are good looking
bachelors; you know they always like t'have clean linen when they go
t'a dance, and I have been thinking about all this."
She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,
but her father knew and said, "You shall have the mules, my love, and
whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall
get you a good strong waggon with a body t'it that will hold all your
clothes."
On this he gave his orders t'the servants, wh'got the waggon out,
harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the

mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good
things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got int'the waggon,

laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach

with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream,
and waited for the sun t'finish drying the clothes. When they had done

of the maids, which missed her and fell int'deep water. On this they
all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, wh'sat up in his

"Alas," said he t'himself, "what kind of people have I come amongst?

delighted they must feel when they see s'fair a scion as yourself
going out t'a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose
wedding gifts have been the richest, and wh'takes you t'his own home.
I never yet saw any one s'beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am
lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you t'a young
palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of
Apollo—for I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on
that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet
did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I
admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at
yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress;
yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the
sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian
island,55 and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure
still further suffering; for I d'not think that I have yet come t'the
end of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for me.
"And now, 'queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I
have met, and I know n'one else in this country. Show me the way to
your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to
wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's
desire—husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing
better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a
house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends
glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one."
T'this Nausicaa answered, "Stranger, you appear t'be a sensible,
well-disposed person. There is n'accounting for luck; Jove gives
prosperity t'rich and poor just as he chooses, s'you must take what
he has seen fit t'send you, and make the best of it. Now, however,

On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another
back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told
them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They als'brought him the
little golden cruse of oil, and told him t'g'and wash in the stream.
But Ulysses said, "Young women, please t'stand a little on one side
that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,
for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I
cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to
strip56 before a number of good looking young women."
Then they stood on one side and went t'tell the girl, while Ulysses
washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and
from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and
had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and
put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him
look taller and stronger than before, she als'made the hair grow thick
on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;

went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young
and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said
t'her maids:
"Hush, my dears, for I want t'say something. I believe the gods who
live in heaven have sent this man t'the Phaeacians. When I first saw
him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the
gods wh'dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband t'be just
such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want t'go
away. However, give him something t'eat and drink."
They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, wh'ate and
drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.
Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen`,length:2068,num_lines:32,location:"Scheria",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Ashamed yet grateful",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Odysseus feels ashamed for being vulnerable in front of young women, yet he is grateful for their kindness.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Nausicaa",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Admiring and hopeful",sentiment:.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Nausicaa admires Odysseus and feels hopeful that the gods have brought him to her people.",importance_rank:2}],number:6,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:6},{title:"Journey to the Town",summary:"Nausicaa leads Ulysses to the city of the Phaeacians.",chapter:"BOOK VI",first_line:199,last_line:266,explanation:"They leave the washing site for the town.",text:`folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she
took her seat, she called Ulysses:
"Stranger," said she, "rise and let us be going back t'the town; I
will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can
tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians.
But be sure and d'as I bid you, for you seem t'be a sensible person.
As long as we are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly
behind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.
Presently, however, we shall come t'the town, where you will find a
high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side with
a narrow entrance int'the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the
road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You
will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it,
and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in
ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are
the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of
archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring
folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which
they travel far over the sea.
"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against
me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low
fellow, if he met us, might say, 'Wh'is this fine-looking stranger
that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose
she is going t'marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has
taken from some foreign vessel, for we have n'neighbours; or some god
has at last come down from heaven in answer t'her prayers, and she is
going t'live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good
thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else,
for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who
are in love with her.' This is the kind of disparaging remark that
would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself
be scandalised at seeing any other girl d'the like, and g'about with
men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still
alive, and without having been married in the face of all the world.
"If, therefore, you want my father t'give you an escort and t'help
you home, d'as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by
the road side dedicated t'Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow
all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about
as far from the town as a man's voice will carry. Sit down there and
wait for a while till the rest of us can get int'the town and reach my
father's house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into
the town and ask the way t'the house of my father Alcinous. You will
have n'difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out t'you,
for n'one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house
as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer
court, g'right across the inner court till you come t'my mother. You
will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by
firelight. It is a fine sight t'see her as she leans back against one
of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close t'her
seat stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an
immortal god. Never mind him, but g'up t'my mother, and lay your
hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her
over, you may hope t'see your own country again, n'matter how distant
it may be."
S'saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.
The mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.
She was careful not t'g'to'fast for Ulysses and the maids wh'were
following on foot along with the waggon, s'she plied her whip with
judgement. As the sun was going down they came t'the sacred grove of
Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed t'the mighty daughter
of Jove.
"Hear me," he cried, "daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear
me now, for you gave n'heed t'my prayers when Neptune was wrecking
me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends
and be hospitably received by the Phaeacians."
Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show
herself t'him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, wh'was
still furious in his endeavors t'prevent Ulysses from getting home.`,length:4496,num_lines:68,location:"Scheria",importance:.9,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Nausicaa",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character guiding Ulysses",emotion:"cautious and concerned",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low fellow, if he met us, might say, 'Wh'is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with Nausicaa?'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character receiving guidance",emotion:"hopeful and desperate",sentiment:.7,quote:"Hear me,",fake_quote:"Ulysses is praying for help and guidance, showing his desperation for assistance from the Phaeacians.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Minerva",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Important as a divine figure",emotion:"watchful and protective",sentiment:.6,quote:"Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show herself t'him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:7,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Ulysses Arrives at Palace",summary:"Ulysses arrives at the palace of King Alcinous.",chapter:"BOOK VII",first_line:1,last_line:61,explanation:"Start of chapter",text:`RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.
Thus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on t'the
town. When she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway,
and her brothers—comely as the gods—gathered round her, took the mules
out of the waggon, and carried the clothes int'the house, while she
went t'her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit
the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,
and had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over
the Phaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god.57
She had been nurse t'Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and
brought her supper for her int'her own room.
Presently Ulysses got up t'g'towards the town; and Minerva shed a
thick mist all round him t'hide him in case any of the proud
Phaeacians wh'met him should be rude t'him, or ask him wh'he was.
Then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the
likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front
of him, and Ulysses said:
"My dear, will you be s'kind as t'show me the house of king Alcinous?
I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and d'not know one in your
town and country."
Then Minerva said, "Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you
want, for Alcinous lives quite close t'my own father. I will g'before
you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and d'not look at
any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide
strangers, and d'not like men wh'come from some other place. They are
a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships
that glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air."
On this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one
of the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the
midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards
him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their
harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,
which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when
they reached the king's house Minerva said:
"This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.
You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but d'not be
afraid; g'straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is
t'carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen.
Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband
Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, wh'was father to
Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the
youngest daughter of Eurymedon, wh'at one time reigned over the
giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to
boot.
"Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the
great Nausithous, wh'reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two
sons Rhexenor and Alcinous;58 Apoll'killed the first of them while he
was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter
Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as n'other woman is honoured
of all those that keep house along with their husbands.
"Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her
children, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, wh'look upon
her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for
she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any
women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands als't'settle
their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope
of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back t'your home and
country."
Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to
Marathon59 and t'the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered the
abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on t'the house of Alcinous, and`,length:3901,num_lines:61,location:"Scheria",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Main character seeking help",emotion:"Hopeful and desperate",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and d'not know one in your town and country.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Minerva",importance:1,importance_exp:"Guiding Ulysses to safety",emotion:"Supportive and protective",sentiment:.8,quote:"Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you want, for Alcinous lives quite close t'my own father.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Arete",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Potential ally for Ulysses",emotion:"Respected and revered",sentiment:.7,quote:"she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Ulysses Enters the Palace",summary:"Ulysses enters the palace and is welcomed by the Phaeacians.",chapter:"BOOK VII",first_line:62,last_line:110,explanation:"Ulysses enters the palace.",text:`he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of
bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or
moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end t'end, and the
cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of
silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver
and the hook of the door was of gold.
On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with
his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly t'keep watch over the
palace of king Alcinous; s'they were immortal and could never grow
old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end
t'the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the
house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used t'sit
and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there
were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands,
raised on pedestals, t'give light by night t'those wh'were at table.
There are60 fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always
grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom,
or sit and spin, and their shuttles g'backwards and forwards like the
fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is s'closely woven that it
will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so
their women excel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them
all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.
Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about
four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful
trees—pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are
luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor
fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so
soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on
pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and s'als'with the grapes, for
there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,
the grapes are being made int'raisins; in another part they are being
gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on
have shed their blossom and are beginning t'show fruit, others again
are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are
beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year
round. Tw'streams g'through it, the one turned in ducts throughout
the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the
outer court t'the house itself, and the town's people draw water from
it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the
house of king Alcinous.
S'here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had
looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the
precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the
Phaeacians making their drink offerings t'Mercury, which they always
did the last thing before going away for the night.61 He went straight
through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which
Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King Alcinous;
then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment
the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible.

began at once with his petition.
"Queen Arete," he exclaimed, "daughter of great Rhexenor, in my
distress I humbly pray you, as als'your husband and these your guests
(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they
leave their possessions t'their children, and all the honours
conferred upon them by the state) t'help me home t'my own country as
soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my
friends."
Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their
peace, till presently the old her'Echeneus, wh'was an excellent
speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty
addressed them thus:
"Alcinous," said he, "it is not creditable t'you that a stranger
should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is
waiting t'hear what you are about t'say; tell him, then, t'rise and
take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix
some wine and water that we may make a drink offering t'Jove the lord
of thunder, wh'takes all well disposed suppliants under his
protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever
there may be in the house."
When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from
the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, wh'had been
sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then
brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it int'a
silver basin for him t'wash his hands, and she drew a clean table
beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many
good things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.
Then Alcinous said t'one of the servants, "Pontonous, mix a cup of
wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings t'Jove the
lord of thunder, wh'is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants."
Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving
every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and
had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:
"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You
have had your supper, s'now g'home t'bed. To-morrow morning I shall
invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial
banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his
escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing t'his
own country without trouble or inconvenience t'himself, n'matter how
distant it may be. We must see that he comes t'n'harm while on his
homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have t'take the
luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is
possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals wh'has
come down from heaven t'visit us; but in this case the gods are
departing from their usual practice, for hithert'they have made
themselves perfectly clear t'us when we have been offering them
hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,
and if any solitary wayfarer happens t'stumble upon some one or other
of them, they affect n'concealment, for we are as near of kin t'the
gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are."62
Then Ulysses said: "Pray, Alcinous, d'not take any such notion into
your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor
mind, and most resemble those among you wh'are the most afflicted.
Indeed, were I t'tell you all that heaven has seen fit t'lay upon me,
you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,
let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very
importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice n'matter how
dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I
shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and
dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, d'as
you propose, and at break of day set about helping me t'get home. I
shall be content t'die if I may first once more behold my property, my
bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house."63
Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he`,length:4188,num_lines:65,location:"Scheria",importance:.9,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Ulysses is the main character seeking help.",emotion:"Desperate and sorrowful",sentiment:-.8,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Odysseus expresses desperation and sorrow as he pleads for help to return home after enduring many hardships.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Alcinous",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Alcinous is the host and decision-maker.",emotion:"Concerned and hospitable",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Alcinous shows concern for his guests and hospitality by urging them to rest after their meal.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Echeneus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Echeneus provides wise counsel to Alcinous.",emotion:"Wise and authoritative",sentiment:.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Echeneus speaks wisely and authoritatively, emphasizing the importance of addressing the needs of a stranger.",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Ulysses Shares His Story",summary:"Ulysses recounts his journey and misfortunes to Arete and Alcinous.",chapter:"BOOK VII",first_line:176,last_line:232,explanation:"Ulysses shares his backstory.",text:`should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when
they had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he
was minded they went home t'bed every man in his own abode, leaving
Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were
taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first t'speak, for
she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was
wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; s'she said,
"Stranger, before we g'any further, there is a question I should like
t'ask you. Who, and whence are you, and wh'gave you those clothes?
Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?"
And Ulysses answered, "It would be a long story Madam, were I t'relate
in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been
laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island
far away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the
cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by
herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,
brought me t'her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my
ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave
comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck t'the keel and
was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last
during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me t'the
Ogygian island where the great goddess Calyps'lives. She took me in
and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted t'make me
immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to
let her d'so.
"I stayed with Calyps'seven years straight on end, and watered the
good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at
last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free
will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because she had
changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she
provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good
stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days
seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught
sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast—and glad
indeed was I t'set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much
trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me g'no
further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was s'terribly
high that I could n'longer keep t'my raft, which went t'pieces under
the fury of the gale, and I had t'swim for it, till wind and current
brought me t'your shores.
"There I tried t'land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the
waves dashed me against the rocks, s'I again took t'the sea and swam
on till I came t'a river that seemed the most likely landing place,
for there were n'rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then,
I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was
coming on, s'I left the river, and went int'a thicket, where I
covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off
int'a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the
leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke
as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing
upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I
besought her aid, and she proved t'be of an excellent disposition,
much more s'than could be expected from s'young a person—for young
people are apt t'be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,
and when she had had me washed in the river she als'gave me the
clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to
d'so, I have told you the whole truth."`,length:3783,num_lines:57,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Reflective and sorrowful",sentiment:.2,quote:"Now, therefore, though it has pained me to d'so, I have told you the whole truth.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Arete",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character asking questions",emotion:"Curious and attentive",sentiment:.5,quote:"Stranger, before we g'any further, there is a question I should like t'ask you.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Alcinous",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Moderately important character present",emotion:"Neutral and observant",sentiment:0,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Alcinous listens to the conversation, showing interest but not actively participating.",importance_rank:3}],number:4,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Ulysses is Offered Hospitality",summary:"Alcinous offers Ulysses hospitality and a chance to stay.",chapter:"BOOK VII",first_line:233,last_line:265,explanation:"Alcinous proposes to Ulysses.",text:`Then Alcinous said, "Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to
bring you on at once t'my house along with the maids, seeing that she
was the first person whose aid you asked."
"Pray d'not scold her," replied Ulysses; "she is not t'blame. She did
tell me t'follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,
for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every
human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."
"Stranger," replied Alcinous, "I am not the kind of man t'get angry
about nothing; it is always better t'be reasonable; but by Father
Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are,
and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my
daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a
house and an estate, but n'one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here
against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend
tomorrow t'the matter of your escort. You can sleep64 during the whole
voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters
either t'your own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a
long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people wh'saw it
when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus t'see Tityus the son of
Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place—and yet they did the whole
voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and came back
again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others,
and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."
Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, "Father Jove, grant that
Alcinous may d'all as he has said, for s'he will win an imperishable
name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return t'my country."
Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids t'set a bed in the
room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to
spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to
wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when

Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous
and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way t'the Phaeacian place
of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat
down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the
form of one of Alcinous' servants, and went round the town in order to
help Ulysses t'get home. She went up t'the citizens, man by man, and
said, "Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come t'the
assembly all of you and listen t'the stranger wh'has just come off a
long voyage t'the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal
god."
With these words she made them all want t'come, and they flocked to
the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one
was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified
him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter
than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as
being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials
of skill t'which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got
together, Alcinous spoke:
"Hear me," said he, "aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,
that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be,
has found his way t'my house from somewhere or other either East or
West. He wants an escort and wishes t'have the matter settled. Let us
then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him;
indeed, n'one wh'ever yet came t'my house has been able t'complain
of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into
the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with tw'and
fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your
oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come t'my house to
prepare a feast.65 I will find you in everything. I am giving these
instructions t'the young men wh'will form the crew, for as regards
you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining our
guest in the cloisters. I can take n'excuses, and we will have
Demodocus t'sing t'us; for there is n'bard like him whatever he may

servant went t'fetch Demodocus. The fifty-tw'picked oarsmen went to
the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew
the ship int'the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the
oars t'the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due
course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a
little way out from land, and then came on shore and went t'the house
of King Alcinous. The out houses,66 yards, and all the precincts were
filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and
Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two
oxen. These they skinned and dressed s'as t'provide a magnificent
banquet.
A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had
dearly loved, but t'whom she had given both good and evil, for though
she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of
his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it
up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his
head, and showed him where he was t'feel for it with his hands. He
als'set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup
of wine from which he might drink whenever he was s'disposed.
The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before
them, but as soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink, the muse
inspired Demodocus t'sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a
matter that was then in the mouths of all men, t'wit, the quarrel
between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on
one another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad
when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo
had foretold him this at Pyth'when he crossed the stone floor to
consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will
of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.
Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head
and covered his face, for he was ashamed t'let the Phaeacians see that
he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from
his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a
drink-offering t'the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus
t'sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again
drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. N'one noticed his
distress except Alcinous, wh'was sitting near him, and heard the heavy
sighs that he was heaving. S'he at once said, "Aldermen and town
councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the
feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us
proceed therefore t'the athletic sports, s'that our guest on his
return home may be able t'tell his friends how much we surpass all
other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners."

cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief
men of the Phaeacians were going t'see the sports; a crowd of several
thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent
competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,
Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,
and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was als'Euryalus
son of Naubolus, wh'was like Mars himself, and was the best looking
man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous,
Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.
The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the
starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew
forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he
left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a
couple of mules can plough in a fallow field.67 They then turned t'the
painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved t'be the best man.
Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the
disc there was n'one wh'could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's son
Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was wh'presently said, when
they had all been diverted with the games, "Let us ask the stranger
whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully
built; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,
nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is
nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, n'matter how strong
he is."
"You are quite right, Laodamas," replied Euryalus, "g'up t'your guest
and speak t'him about it yourself."
When Laodamas heard this he made his way int'the middle of the crowd
and said t'Ulysses, "I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for
some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of
them—and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is
nothing that does any one s'much credit all his life long as the
showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try
therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your
return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn
int'the water, and the crew is found."
Ulysses answered, "Laodamas, why d'you taunt me in this way? my mind
is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite
trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king
and people t'further me on my return home."
Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, "I gather, then, that you
are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.
I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that g'about in ships
as captains or merchants, and wh'think of nothing but of their outward
freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem t'be much of the
athlete about you."
"For shame, Sir," answered Ulysses, fiercely, "you are an insolent
fellow—s'true is it that the gods d'not grace all men alike in
speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but
heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms
every one wh'sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with
him s'that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever
he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but
his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No
god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool.
Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are
quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed,
s'long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of
the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have
gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the
weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts
have stung me t'the quick."
S'he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,
larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians
when disc-throwing among themselves.68 Then, swinging it back, he threw
it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he
did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it
sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been
made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place
where it had fallen. "A blind man, Sir," said she, "could easily tell
your mark by groping for it—it is s'far ahead of any other. You may
make your mind easy about this contest, for n'Phaeacian can come near
t'such a throw as yours."
Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so
he began t'speak more pleasantly. "Young men," said he, "come up to
that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even
heavier. If anyone wants t'have a bout with me let him come on, for I
am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I d'not care what
it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him
because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal
friend. At least I d'not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a
guest t'challenge his host's family at any game, especially when he is
in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if
he does; but I make n'exception as regards any one else, for I want to
have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at
every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent
archer. In battle I am always the first t'bring a man down with my
arrow, n'matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.
Philoctetes was the only man wh'could shoot better than I could when
we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one
else in the whole world, of those wh'still eat bread upon the face of
the earth, but I should not like t'shoot against the mighty dead, such
as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men wh'could shoot against the
gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his
end, for Apoll'was angry with him and killed him because he challenged
him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can
shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am
afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought
down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still
weak."`,length:6544,num_lines:100,location:"Scheria",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central character facing challenges",emotion:"Angry and defiant",sentiment:-.5,quote:"For shame, Sir, answered Ulysses, fiercely, you are an insolent fellow—s'true is it that the gods d'not grace all men alike in speech, person, and understanding.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Laodamas",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Encourages Ulysses to compete",emotion:"Encouraging and friendly",sentiment:.5,quote:"I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of them—and you must have gone in for many a one before now.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Euryalus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Provokes Ulysses into competition",emotion:"Mocking and confrontational",sentiment:-.6,quote:"I gather, then, that you are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Ulysses' Challenge",summary:"Ulysses responds to taunts and challenges the Phaeacians.",chapter:"BOOK VIII",first_line:181,last_line:278,explanation:"Location changes as Ulysses speaks to the crowd.",text:`They all held their peace except King Alcinous, wh'began, "Sir, we
have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which
I understand that you are willing t'show your prowess, as having been
displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made t'you by one
of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who
knows how t'talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,
and will explain t'any one of your chief men wh'may be dining with
yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary
aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly
remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly
fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good
dinners, music, and dancing; we als'like frequent changes of linen,
warm baths, and good beds, s'now, please, some of you wh'are the best
dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be
able t'tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as
sailors, runners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre
at my house, s'run some one or other of you and fetch it for him."
On this a servant hurried off t'bring the lyre from the king's house,
and the nine men wh'had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was
their business t'manage everything connected with the sports, s'they
made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.
Presently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took his
place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town
began t'foot and trip it s'nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the
merry twinkling of their feet.
Meanwhile the bard began t'sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how
they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus
many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, s'the sun, who
saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he
heard such dreadful news, s'he went t'his smithy brooding mischief,
got his great anvil int'its place, and began t'forge some chains
which none could either unloose or break, s'that they might stay there
in that place.69 When he had finished his snare he went int'his
bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs;
he als'let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even
a god could see them s'fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had
spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting
out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was
the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept n'blind look out, and as
soon as he saw him start, hurried off t'his house, burning with love
for Venus.
Now Venus was just come in from a visit t'her father Jove, and was
about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took
her hand in his own, "Let us g't'the couch of Vulcan: he is not at
home, but is gone off t'Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is
barbarous."
She was nothing loth, s'they went t'the couch t'take their rest,
whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread
for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too
late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up t'them, for he had
turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him
what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the
vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted t'all the gods.
"Father Jove," he cried, "and all you other blessed gods wh'live for
ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I
will show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because
I am lame. She is in love with Mars, wh'is handsome and clean built,
whereas I am a cripple—but my parents are t'blame for that, not I;
they ought never t'have begotten me. Come and see the pair together
asleep on my bed. It makes me furious t'look at them. They are very
fond of one another, but I d'not think they will lie there longer than
they can help, nor d'I think that they will sleep much; there,
however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave
him for his baggage of a daughter, wh'is fair but not honest."
On this the gods gathered t'the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling
Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the
goddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all
good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with
inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,
whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:
"Ill deeds d'not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how
limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars wh'is the fleetest god
in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages."
Thus did they converse, but King Apoll'said t'Mercury, "Messenger
Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains
were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?"
"King Apollo," answered Mercury, "I only wish I might get the chance,
though there were three times as many chains—and you might look on, all
of you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could."
The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune
took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan t'set Mars free
again. "Let him go," he cried, "and I will undertake, as you require,
that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among
the immortal gods."
"D'not," replied Vulcan, "ask me t'd'this; a bad man's bond is bad
security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go
away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?"
"Vulcan," said Neptune, "if Mars goes away without paying his damages,
I will pay you myself." S'Vulcan answered, "In this case I cannot and
must not refuse you."
Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were
free they scampered off, Mars t'Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to
Cyprus and t'Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with
burnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil
of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her
in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.
Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were
charmed as they heard him.`,length:6375,num_lines:98,location:"Scheria",importance:.9,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Alcinous",importance:.8,importance_exp:"He initiates the festivities and speaks to Ulysses.",emotion:"Welcoming and proud",sentiment:.7,quote:'"Sir, we have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us..."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Odysseus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"He is the guest and the focus of the scene.",emotion:"Delighted and entertained",sentiment:.8,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Ulysses is captivated by the dancers and the music, enjoying the hospitality.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Demodocus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"He provides entertainment through his singing.",emotion:"Artistic and engaging",sentiment:.6,quote:`"Meanwhile the bard began t'sing the loves of Mars and Venus..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Vulcan",importance:.6,importance_exp:"His actions drive the narrative of the song.",emotion:"Angry and vengeful",sentiment:-.5,quote:'"Come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I will show you."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4},{name:"Mars",importance:.5,importance_exp:"He is central to the story being sung by Demodocus.",emotion:"Passionate and reckless",sentiment:.5,quote:`"Let us g't'the couch of Vulcan: he is not at home..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:5},{name:"Venus",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Her actions are pivotal in the story sung by Demodocus.",emotion:"Seductive and carefree",sentiment:.6,quote:`"She was nothing loth, s'they went t'the couch t'take their rest..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:6},{name:"Neptune",importance:.4,importance_exp:"He tries to intervene in the conflict between Vulcan and Mars.",emotion:"Serious and concerned",sentiment:.4,quote:'"Let him go," he cried, "and I will undertake..."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:7},{name:"Mercury",importance:.4,importance_exp:"He adds humor and lightness to the scene.",emotion:"Playful and flirtatious",sentiment:.5,quote:'"King Apollo," answered Mercury, "I only wish I might get the chance..."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:8},{name:"Apollo",importance:.4,importance_exp:"He observes and comments on the situation.",emotion:"Amused and light-hearted",sentiment:.5,quote:'"Messenger Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains were..."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:9}],number:4,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Demodocus' Song",summary:"Demodocus sings about the Trojan War, moving Ulysses.",chapter:"BOOK VIII",first_line:279,last_line:446,explanation:"Location changes as the bard begins to sing.",text:`Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius t'dance alone, for there was no
one t'compete with them. S'they took a red ball which Polybus had
made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up
towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and
caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done
throwing the ball straight up int'the air they began t'dance, and at
the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards t'one
another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great
stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:
"King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the
world, and indeed they have proved themselves t'be so. I was
astonished as I saw them."
The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed t'the Phaeacians,
"Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems t'be a person of
singular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he
may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and
counting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean
cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in
a lump down at once, s'that when he gets his supper he may d's'with
a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have t'make a formal apology
and a present too, for he has been rude."
Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and
sent their servants t'fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, "King
Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He
shall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of
silver. I will als'give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into
which it fits. It will be worth a great deal t'him."
As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, "Good
luck t'you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the
winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,
for I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone
through much hardship."
T'which Ulysses answered, "Good luck t'you to'my friend, and may the
gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you
have given me along with your apology."
With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards
sundown the presents began t'make their appearance, as the servants of
the donors kept bringing them t'the house of King Alcinous; here his
sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then
Alcinous led the way t'the house and bade his guests take their seats.
"Wife," said he, turning t'Queen Arete, "Go, fetch the best chest we
have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the
fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see als'to
the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made
him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that
will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet—which is of
exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his
life whenever he makes a drink offering t'Jove, or t'any of the
gods."70
Then Arete told her maids t'set a large tripod upon the fire as fast
as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on t'a
clear fire; they threw on sticks t'make it blaze, and the water became
hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.71 Meanwhile
Arete brought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she
packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the
Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from
Alcinous, and said t'Ulysses:
"See t'the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for
fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your
ship." 72
When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast
with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done s'before an upper
servant told him t'come t'the bath and wash himself. He was very glad
of a warm bath, for he had had n'one t'wait upon him ever since he
left the house of Calypso, wh'as long as he remained with her had
taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the
servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him
a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests
wh'were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the
bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as
she saw him pass. "Farewell stranger," said she, "d'not forget me when
you are safe at home again, for it is t'me first that you owe a ransom
for having saved your life."
And Ulysses said, "Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the
mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; s'shall I
bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you wh'saved
me."
When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was
then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the
favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near
one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean
against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of
fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said t'a servant,
"Take this piece of pork over t'Demodocus and tell him t'eat it; for
all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;
bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse
teaches them their songs and loves them."
The servant carried the pork in his fingers over t'Demodocus, wh'took
it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good
things that were before them, and as soon as they had had t'eat and
drink, Ulysses said t'Demodocus, "Demodocus, there is n'one in the
world whom I admire more than I d'you. You must have studied under the
Muse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, s'accurately d'you sing the
return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you
were not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who
was. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse
which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got
by stratagem int'the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who
afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will
tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you."
The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some
of the Argives set fire t'their tents and sailed away while others,
hidden within the horse,73 were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan
place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into
their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it,
and were in three minds as t'what they should do. Some were for
breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged t'the top
of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the
precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering
and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the
end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which
were all the bravest of the Argives waiting t'bring death and
destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans
issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their
ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and
ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus
t'the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most
furiously, nevertheless by Minerva's help he was victorious.
All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his
cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws
herself on the body of her husband wh'has fallen before his own city
and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She
screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for
breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back
and shoulders, and carry her off int'slavery, t'a life of labour and
sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks—even s'piteously did
Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except
Alcinous, wh'was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs
that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:
"Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease
his song, for there are those present wh'd'not seem t'like it. From
the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began t'sing, our
guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in
great trouble, s'let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy
ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should
be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we
are making with s'much good will are wholly in his honour, and any one
with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to
treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.
"Therefore, Sir, d'you on your part affect n'more concealment nor
reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more
polite in you t'give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your
father and mother over yonder used t'call you, and by which you were
known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is n'one,
neither rich nor poor, wh'is absolutely without any name whatever, for
people's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.
Tell me als'your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape
their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have
n'pilots; their vessels have n'rudders as those of other nations
have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are
thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the
whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is
covered with mist and cloud, s'that there is n'danger of being
wrecked or coming t'any harm. Still I d'remember hearing my father
say that Neptune was angry with us for being to'easy-going in the
matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he
should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted
some one,74 and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my
father used t'say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no
is a matter which he will decide for himself.
"And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and
in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples
themselves, and of their cities—wh'were hostile, savage and
uncivilised, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us
als'why you are made s'unhappy on hearing about the return of the
Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them
their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something
t'sing about.

And Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous, it is a good thing t'hear a bard
with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or
more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the
guests sitting orderly t'listen, while the table is loaded with bread
and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every
man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,
since you are inclined t'ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my
own sad memories in respect of them, I d'not know how t'begin, nor
yet how t'continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has
been laid heavily upon me.
"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you to'may know it, and
one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though
I live s'far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,
renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, s'that my fame
ascends t'heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain
called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a
group of islands very near t'one another—Dulichium, Same, and the
wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest
up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it
towards dawn.75 It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my
eyes know none that they better love t'look upon. The goddess Calypso
kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me t'marry her, as did also
the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them
persuade me, for there is nothing dearer t'a man than his own country
and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign
country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it.
Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by
Jove's will I met with on my return from Troy.`,length:1949,num_lines:30,location:"Scheria",importance:.9,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Ulysses is the main character sharing his story.",emotion:"Reflective and sorrowful",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I am Ulysses son of Laertes, renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, s'that my fame ascends t'heaven.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Alcinous",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Alcinous is the host and initiator of the storytelling.",emotion:"Curious and welcoming",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"King Alcinous shows interest in Ulysses' story and encourages him to share.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:7},{title:"The Cicones Encounter",summary:"Ulysses recounts the attack on the Cicones.",chapter:"BOOK IX",first_line:31,last_line:49,explanation:"Change of location to Ismarus.",text:`"When I had set sail thence the wind took me first t'Ismarus, which is

Cicons cried out for help t'other Cicons wh'lived inland. These were

war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the
occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as

that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships,

them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went

had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows wh'had perished by the
hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it
blew a hurricane, s'that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and
night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the
gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails t'tatters, s'we took
them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the
land. There we lay tw'days and tw'nights suffering much alike from
toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again
raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and
steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed

doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of
Cythera.

live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed t'take
in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near
the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent tw'of my company to
see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a
third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the
Lotus-eaters, wh'did them n'hurt, but gave them t'eat of the lotus,

wept bitterly I forced them back t'the ships and made them fast under

grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes
yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no
laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of
high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no
account of their neighbours.
"Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite
close t'the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run
with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never
disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen—wh'as a rule will suffer so
much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices—d'not g'there,
nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness
untilled and unsown from year t'year, and has n'living thing upon it

could make ships for them; they cannot therefore g'from city t'city,

"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired the
island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters
roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On
this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and
dividing ourselves int'three bands began t'shoot the goats. Heaven
sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got
nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to
the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty
of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we
sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we
were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the
Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires.
We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their
sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we
camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.
"'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you, while I

are uncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'

we got t'the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff
near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a
station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large
yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built int'the ground
and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster

"I told my men t'draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all
but the twelve best among them, wh'were t'g'along with myself. I
als'took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by
Maron, son of Euanthes, wh'was priest of Apoll'the patron god of
Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we
were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also
his wife and child; s'he made me some presents of great value—seven
talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet
wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid
in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one
housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water t'one of
wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was s'exquisite that
it was impossible t'refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with
this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind
misgave me that I might have t'deal with some savage wh'would be of
great strength, and would respect neither right nor law.
"We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, s'we went
inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were
loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could
hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets,
then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones80
all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels,
bowls, and milk pails int'which he milked, were swimming with whey.
When they saw all this, my men begged me t'let them first steal some
cheeses, and make off with them t'the ship; they would then return,
drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with
them. It would have been indeed better if we had done s'but I would
not listen t'them, for I wanted t'see the owner himself, in the hope
that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men
found him ill t'deal with.
"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of
them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his
sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood
t'light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise
on t'the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far
end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as
the she-goats that he was going t'milk, leaving the males, both rams
and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone t'the
mouth of the cave—s'huge that tw'and twenty strong four-wheeled
waggons would not be enough t'draw it from its place against the
doorway. When he had s'done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats,
all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He
curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the
other half he poured int'bowls that he might drink it for his supper.
When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then
caught sight of us, whereon he said:
"'Strangers, wh'are you? Where d'sail from? Are you traders, or do
you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and
every man's hand against you?'
"We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous
form, but I managed t'say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,
but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far
out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who
has won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking s'great
a city and killing s'many people. We therefore humbly pray you t'show
us some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors
may reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven,
for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers
under his protection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and
foreigners in distress.'
"T'this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you
are a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk t'me,
indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do
not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so
much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your
companions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for
doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the
land?'
"He said this t'draw me out, but I was to'cunning t'be caught in
that way, s'I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship on
t'the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were
driven on t'them from the open sea, but I and those wh'are with me
escaped the jaws of death.'
"The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a
sudden clutch he gripped up tw'of my men at once and dashed them down
upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed
upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore
them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a
lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without
leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to
heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to

his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be
lost, for we should never be able t'shift the stone which the monster
had put in front of the door. S'we stayed sobbing and sighing where we
were till morning came.
"When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit
his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let
each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his
work, he clutched up tw'more of my men, and began eating them for his
morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone
away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back
again—as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on t'a
quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done s'he shouted, and cried
'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep t'drive them on t'the mountain; s'I
was left t'scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself
with glory.
"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan t'd'as follows: The
Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it
was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending t'use it for a
staff as soon as it should be dry. It was s'huge that we could only
compare it t'the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large
burden, and able t'venture out int'open sea. I went up t'this club
and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece t'the men and
told them t'fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded t'do,
and lastly I brought it t'a point myself, charring the end in the fire
t'make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was
lying about all over the cave, and told the men t'cast lots which of
them should venture along with myself t'lift it and bore it int'the
monster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom
I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch
came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks int'the cave—this
time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I
suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him
t'd'so. As soon as he had put the stone back t'its place against the
door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and
then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all
this work, he gripped up tw'more of my men, and made his supper off
them. S'I went up t'him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my
hands:
"'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal of
man's flesh, s'take this and drink some wine, that you may see what
kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it t'you as a
drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and
further me on my way home, whereas all you d'is t'g'on ramping and
raving most intolerably. You ought t'be ashamed of yourself; how can
you expect people t'come see you any more if you treat them in this
way?'
"He then took the cup and drank. He was s'delighted with the taste of
the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be s'kind,' he
said, 'as t'give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want
t'make you a present that you will be glad t'have. We have wine even
in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but
this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.'
"I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,
and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I
saw that the wine had got int'his head, I said t'him as plausibly as
I could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,
therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what
my father and mother and my friends have always called me.'
"But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades
before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the
present that I will make him.'
"As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.
His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon
him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets
of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.
Then I thrust the beam of wood far int'the embers t'heat it, and
encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the
wood, green though it was, was about t'blaze, I drew it out of the
fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had
filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam
int'the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept
turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's
plank with an auger, which tw'men with a wheel and strap can keep on
turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam
int'his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked
it round and round, s'that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded
his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the
fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet int'cold water to
temper it—for it is this that gives strength t'the iron—and it makes a
great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the
beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We
ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore
from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain,
shouting as he did s't'the other Cyclopes wh'lived on the bleak
headlands near him; s'they gathered from all quarters round his cave
when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.
"'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,
breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able
t'sleep? Surely n'man is carrying off your sheep? Surely n'man is
trying t'kill you either by fraud or by force?'
"But Polyphemus shouted t'them from inside the cave, 'Noman is killing
me by fraud; n'man is killing me by force.'
"'Then,' said they, 'if n'man is attacking you, you must be ill; when
Jove makes people ill, there is n'help for it, and you had better pray
t'your father Neptune.'
"Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my
clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,
felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the
door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it
t'catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be
foolish enough t'attempt this.
"As for myself I kept on puzzling t'think how I could best save my own
life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who
knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In
the end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were
well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, s'I bound them
noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the
wicked monster used t'sleep. There was t'be a man under the middle
sheep, and the tw'on either side were t'cover him, s'that there were
three sheep t'each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any
of the others, s'I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in
the thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently t'his fleece,
face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time.
"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but
when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep
hurried out t'feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens
waiting t'be milked, for their udders were full t'bursting; but their
master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they
stood upright, without being sharp enough t'find out that the men were
underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy
with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid
hold of it and said:
"'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last t'leave my cave this
morning? You are not wont t'let the ewes g'before you, but lead the
mob with a run whether t'flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are
the first t'come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is
it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because
that wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and
blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and
talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash
his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should
thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done
me.'
"As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way
out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,
and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by
constantly heading them in the right direction we managed t'drive them
down t'the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who
had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.
However, I made signs t'them by nodding and frowning that they were to
hush their crying, and told them t'get all the sheep on board at once
and put out t'sea; s'they went aboard, took their places, and smote
the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my
voice would reach, I began t'jeer at the Cyclops.
"'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your man
before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your
visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would
find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.'
"He got more and more furious as he heard me, s'he tore the top from
off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship s'that it
was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.81 The sea quaked
as the rock fell int'it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us
back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I
snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs t'my men
by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they
laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I
was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of
me t'hold my tongue.
"'D'not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough t'provoke this savage
creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us
back again t'the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of
us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have
pounded our heads and our ship's timbers int'a jelly with the rugged
rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'
"But I would not listen t'them, and shouted out t'him in my rage,
'Cyclops, if any one asks you wh'it was that put your eye out and
spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of
Laertes, wh'lives in Ithaca.'`,length:11027,num_lines:169,location:"Land Of The Cyclopes",importance:1,conflict:1,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Main character executing the plan",emotion:"Cunning and vengeful",sentiment:.8,quote:"'Cyclops, if any one asks you wh'it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of Laertes, wh'lives in Ithaca.'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Polyphemus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Antagonist and victim of Odysseus",emotion:"Angry and in pain",sentiment:-.8,quote:"'Noman is killing me by fraud; n'man is killing me by force.'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:7,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"The Escape and Jeering",summary:"Ulysses taunts the Cyclops as they escape.",chapter:"BOOK IX",first_line:402,last_line:445,explanation:"Change of location as they leave the Cyclops' island.",text:`"On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy
about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man
both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, wh'was an
excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he
grew old; he told me that all this would happen t'me some day, and
said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all
along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,
whereas he turns out t'be a little insignificant weakling, wh'has
managed t'blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come
here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents t'show my
hospitality, and urge Neptune t'help you forward on your journey—for
Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he s'will, shall heal me,
which n'one else neither god nor man can do.'
"Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and
sending you down t'the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more
than Neptune t'cure that eye of yours.'
"On this he lifted up his hands t'the firmament of heaven and prayed,
saying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten
son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must
get back t'his friends at last, let him d's'late and in sore plight
after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's ship
and find trouble in his house.'82
"Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a
rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with
prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a
little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock
fell int'it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on
our way towards the shore of the island.
"When at last we got t'the island where we had left the rest of our
ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our
return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on t'the
sea shore; we als'landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them
equitably amongst us s'that none might have reason t'complain. As for
the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share;
s'I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to
Jove, wh'is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only
thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.
"Thus through the livelong day t'the going down of the sun we feasted
our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on
dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered
Dawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they
took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; s'we sailed
on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad t'have escaped death though we
had lost our comrades.`,length:2852,num_lines:44,location:"Land Of The Cyclopes",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Cyclopes",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central character in the conflict",emotion:"Despair and anger",sentiment:-.8,quote:"Alas, alas, then the old prophecy about me is coming true.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Protagonist and key figure",emotion:"Defiant and strategic",sentiment:.5,quote:"I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and sending you down t'the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more than Neptune t'cure that eye of yours.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Neptune",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Influential but not present",emotion:"Indifferent",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Neptune is invoked by Polyphemus but does not respond to Ulysses' sacrifice.",importance_rank:3}],number:8,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Arrival at Aeolian Island",summary:"Ulysses and his men arrive at Aeolus's island.",chapter:"BOOK X",first_line:1,last_line:11,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.

been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre
Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing
t'be got by crying, s'I divided them int'tw'companies and set a
captain over each; I gave one company t'Eurylochus, while I took
command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot

wept, as als'did we wh'were left behind.`,length:1099,num_lines:17,location:"Beach",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Odysseus is the leader and strategist.",emotion:"worried and determined",sentiment:-.5,quote:"My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore t'me.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eurylochus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Eurylochus is a key character chosen for the mission.",emotion:"fearful and resigned",sentiment:-.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Eurylochus feels fearful about the dangerous mission ahead.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Crew Members",importance:.6,importance_exp:"The crew's emotional response highlights their fear.",emotion:"dismayed and sorrowful",sentiment:-.7,quote:"They wept bitterly in their dismay.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:7,importance_rank:10,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Encounter with Circe",summary:"Ulysses's men meet Circe and are transformed.",chapter:"BOOK X",first_line:158,last_line:185,explanation:"The men enter Circe's house.",text:`"When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, on
a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There
were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor
bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged
int'subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great
tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against

stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as
she worked at her loom, making a web s'fine, s'soft, and of such
dazzling colours as n'one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites,
whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, 'There
is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the
whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is
woman or goddess.'

enter. They, thinking n'evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who
suspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them int'her
house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with
cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked
poisons t'make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she
turned them int'pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her
pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and all, and they grunted
just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they

protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which

"'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try
t'practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you t'drink, and she
will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to
charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will
prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it. When
Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as

good care als'of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all
the blessed gods that she will plot n'further mischief against you, or
else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for
nothing.'

work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the
holy waters that run down int'the sea. One of them spread a fair
purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another
brought tables of silver up t'the seats, and set them with baskets of
gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put
golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set
it t'boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted.
When the water in the cauldron was boiling,87 she poured cold int'it
till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began
washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, t'take the
tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me
and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and
led me t'a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a
footstool als'under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a
beautiful golden ewer and poured it int'a silver basin for me t'wash
my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant
brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the
house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without
heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.
"When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,
she came t'me and said, 'Ulysses, why d'you sit like that as though
you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and

of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his
friends free and let him see them. If you want me t'eat and drink, you
must free my men and bring them t'me that I may see them with my own
eyes.'

in her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like s'many
prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and
anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad
drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than
they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at

have left your ship, and first draw it on t'the land. Then, hide all
your ship's gear and property in some cave, and come back here with
your men.'
"I agreed t'this, s'I went back t'the sea shore, and found the men
at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the
silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out
and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home t'be
milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds
with their lowing. They seemed as glad t'see me as though they had got
back t'their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred.
'Sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad t'see you back
as though we had got safe home t'Ithaca; but tell us all about the
fate of our comrades.'
"I spoke comfortingly t'them and said, 'We must draw our ship on to
the land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave;
then come with me all of you as fast as you can t'Circe's house, where
you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great
abundance.'
"On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried
t'hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will
become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going t'the house of Circe, who
will turn us all int'pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to
keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our
comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all
through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'
"When I heard him I was in tw'minds whether or n't'draw the keen
blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his
being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and
said, 'Sir, if it may s'be, let this fellow stay here and mind the
ship, but take the rest of us with you t'Circe's house.'
"On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after
all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand
that I had given him.
"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men wh'had been left behind
were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had als'given them
woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all
comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other
face t'face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud
till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up t'me and said,
'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men t'leave off crying; I
know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have
fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so
stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and
hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are
weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the
hardships you have suffered during your travels, s'that you have no
more cheerfulness left in you.'
"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole
twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But
when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had
come round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time you began
t'think about going home, if s'be you are t'be spared t'see your
house and native country at all.'

t'the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but
when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down
t'sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got int'bed
with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened t'what
I had got t'say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please t'keep the promise you made
me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want t'get back and so
d'my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon
as ever your back is turned.'
"And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall
none of you stay here any longer if you d'not want to, but there is
another journey which you have got t'take before you can sail
homewards. You must g't'the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to

n'ship can reach.'
"'You will want n'guide,' she answered; 'raise your mast, set your
white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of
itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will
reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall
poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your
ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and g'straight on t'the dark abode of
Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon
and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow int'Acheron,
and you will see a rock near it, just where the tw'roaring rivers run
int'one another.
"'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a
cubit or s'in length, breadth, and depth, and pour int'it as a
drink-offering t'all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then
wine, and in the third place water—sprinkling white barley meal over
the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers t'the poor feeble
ghosts, and promise them that when you get back t'Ithaca you will
sacrifice a barren heifer t'them, the best you have, and will load the
pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that
Teiresias shall have a black sheep all t'himself, the finest in all
your flocks.
"'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer
them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but
yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the
river. On this, many dead men's ghosts will come t'you, and you must
tell your men t'skin the tw'sheep that you have just killed, and
offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers t'Hades and to
Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, s'as t'prevent any
other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias
shall have answered your questions. The seer will presently come to
you, and will tell you about your voyage—what stages you are t'make,
and how you are t'sail the sea s'as t'reach your home.'
"It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, s'she dressed me
in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light
gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle
round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went
about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to
each of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,'
said I t'them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.'
And on this they did as I bade them.
"Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had

land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one
long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with

my son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she
could and married again?'
"My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she is
in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night
and day. N'one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and
Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has t'entertain

magistrate,92 and how every one invites him; your father remains at his
old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no

front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in
summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the
vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown any how upon the ground. He
grieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers more
and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise:
heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was
I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out

hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at
once. S'they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned
her told me her race and lineage.
"The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of
Cretheus the son of Aeolus.94 She fell in love with the river Enipeus
wh'is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she
was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her
lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave
arched itself like a mountain over them t'hide both woman and god,
whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.
When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his
own and said, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods
are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve
months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, s'now g'home, but hold
your tongue and d'not tell any one.'
"Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and
Neleus, wh'both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a
great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in
Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,
Pheres, and Amythaon, wh'was a mighty warrior and charioteer.
"Next t'her I saw Antiope, daughter t'Asopus, wh'could boast of
having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and wh'bore him two
sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and
built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not
hold Thebes till they had walled it.
"Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, wh'als'bore t'Jove
indomitable Hercules; and Megara wh'was daughter t'great King Creon,
and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.
"I als'saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it
was t'marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after
having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to
the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the
spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went t'the house of the
mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging
spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother—t'his ruing bitterly
thereafter.
"Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given
priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter t'Amphion son of
Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore
Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she als'bore that marvellously
lovely woman Pero, wh'was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus
would only give her t'him wh'should raid the cattle of Iphicles from
the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man
wh'would undertake t'raid them was a certain excellent seer,95 but
the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle
caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had
passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at
liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then,
was the will of Jove accomplished.
"And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, wh'bore him tw'famous sons,
Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these
heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a
special dispensation of Jove, they die and come t'life again, each one
of them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of
gods.
"After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus wh'boasted the embrace of
Neptune. She bore tw'sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short
lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,
and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they
were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They
threatened t'make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried t'set Mount
Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,
that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it to'if
they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,
before they had got s'much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or
chin.
"Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the
magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete t'Athens, but
he did not enjoy her, for before he could d's'Diana killed her in the
island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.
"I als'saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, wh'sold her own
husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were t'name
every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and

come by your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his
winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies
make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or
sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their wives
and city?'
"'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea
in any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the
mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between
them. He asked me t'his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most
miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all
around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding
breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You
must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or
in single combat, but you never saw anything s'truly pitiable as the
way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the
loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I
heard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her
close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body,
and raised my hands t'kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped
away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was
dying, for there is nothing in this world s'cruel and s'shameless as
a woman when she has fallen int'such guilt as hers was. Fancy
murdering her own husband! I thought I was going t'be welcomed home by
my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought
disgrace on herself and all women wh'shall come after—even on the good
ones.'
"And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to
last in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us fell
for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief
against you to'during your absence.'
"'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be to'friendly
even with your own wife. D'not tell her all that you know perfectly
well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about
the rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely t'murder you, for
Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We
left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for
Troy. This child n'doubt is now grown up happily t'man's estate,96
and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one
another as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not
even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I
could d'so. Furthermore I say—and lay my saying t'your heart—d'not
tell people when you are bringing your ship t'Ithaca, but steal a
march upon them, for after all this there is n'trusting women. But now
tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?
Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelaus—for
I presume that he is still living.'
"And I said, 'Agamemnon, why d'you ask me? I d'not know whether your
son is alive or dead, and it is not right t'talk when one does not
know.'

about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros
with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always
first t'speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the
only tw'wh'could surpass him; and when it came t'fighting on the
plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but
would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man
did he kill in battle—I cannot name every single one of those whom he
slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how
he killed that valiant her'Eurypylus son of Telephus, wh'was the
handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others als'of the
Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when
all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had
made, and it was left t'me t'settle when we should either open the
door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and
chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every
limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he
was all the time urging me t'break out from the horse—grasping the
handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury
against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his
handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the
fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear
nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'
"When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a
meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the
prowess of his son.
"The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own
melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof—still
angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour
of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners
and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in
such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, wh'was foremost of all
the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.
"When I saw him I tried t'pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you not
forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that
hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to
lose such a tower of strength as you were t'us. We mourned you as much
as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid
on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for
it was this that made him counsel your destruction—come hither,
therefore, bring your proud spirit int'subjection, and hear what I can
tell you.'
"He would not answer, but turned away t'Erebus and t'the other
ghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk t'me in spite of his
being s'angry, or I should have gone on talking t'him,97 only that
there were still others among the dead whom I desired t'see.

some nine acres of ground. Tw'vultures on either side of him were
digging their beaks int'his liver, and he kept on trying t'beat them
off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's mistress
Let'as she was going through Panopeus on her way t'Pytho.

reached his chin; he was dying t'quench his thirst, but could never
reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped t'drink, it
dried up and vanished, s'that there was nothing but dry ground—parched
by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that shed
their fruit over his head—pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and
juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to
take some, the wind tossed the branches back again t'the clouds.
"And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone
with both his hands. With hands and feet he tried t'roll it up t'the
top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on to
the other side, its weight would be to'much for him, and the pitiless
stone98 would come thundering down again on t'the plain. Then he would
begin trying t'push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and
the steam rose after him.
"After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he
is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe t'wife,
wh'is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him
like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with
his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around

wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears,
wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was als'war, battle,
and death. The man wh'made that belt, d'what he might, would never be
able t'make another like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me,

above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of

the hell-hound—for he did not think he could find anything harder for
me than this, but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him t'him,

adventures.
"'S'far s'good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay
attention t'what I am about t'tell you—heaven itself, indeed, will
recall it t'your recollection. First you will come t'the Sirens who
enchant all wh'come near them. If any one unwarily draws in to'close
and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never
welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to
death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead
men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them.
Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that
none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you
may get the men t'bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half
way up the mast,99 and they must lash the rope's ends t'the mast
itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and
pray the men t'unloose you, then they must bind you faster.
"'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you
coherent directions100 as t'which of tw'courses you are t'take; I
will lay the tw'alternatives before you, and you must consider them
for yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against
which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the
blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may
pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia t'Father Jove,
but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has
t'send another t'make up their number; n'ship that ever yet came to
these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire
are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only
vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Arg'on her way
from the house of Aetes, and she to'would have gone against these
great rocks, only that Jun'piloted her past them for the love she bore
t'Jason.
"'Of these tw'rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a
dark cloud. This never leaves it, s'that the top is never clear not
even in summer and early autumn. N'man though he had twenty hands and
twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer
up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there
is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must
take your ship this way, but the cave is s'high up that not even the
stoutest archer could send an arrow int'it. Inside it Scylla sits and
yelps with a voice that you might take t'be that of a young hound, but
in truth she is a dreadful monster and n'one—not even a god—could face
her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and
six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck
she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very
close together, s'that they would crunch any one t'death in a moment,
and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and
peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any
larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which
Amphitrite teems. N'ship ever yet got past her without losing some
men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in
each mouth.
"'You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are s'close
together that there is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large
fig tree in full leaf101 grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking
whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her
waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not
there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not
save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you
can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'
"'Is there n'way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same
time keeping Scylla off when she is trying t'harm my men?'
"'You dare devil,' replied the goddess, 'you are always wanting to
fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even
by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,
extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is n'help for it; your best
chance will be t'get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle
about her rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you
with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of
your men; s'drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out
lustily t'Crataiis wh'is Scylla's dam, bad luck t'her; she will then
stop her from making a second raid upon you.'
"'You will now come t'the Thrinacian island, and here you will see
many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging t'the sun-god—seven
herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each
flock. They d'not breed, nor d'they become fewer in number, and they
are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, wh'are children of
the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them
and had done suckling them sent them t'the Thrinacian island, which
was a long way off, t'live there and look after their father's flocks
and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but
getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you
harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and
of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will

they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it

which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were
s'frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea
resounded with the rushing of the waters,103 but the ship stayed where
it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and
exhorted them man by man not t'lose heart.
"'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have been in
danger, and we are in nothing like s'bad a case as when the Cyclops
shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved
us then, and we shall live t'look back on all this as well. Now,
therefore, let us all d'as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might
and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend t'them,
for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming
rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over
yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.'
"S'they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster
Scylla, for I knew the men would not g'on rowing if I did, but would
huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's
strict instructions—I put on my armour. Then seizing tw'strong spears
I took my stand on the ship's bows, for it was there that I expected
first t'see the monster of the rock, wh'was t'd'my men s'much
harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes
with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.
"Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand
was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt
water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when
it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of
the rocks on either side. When she began t'suck again, we could see
the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening
sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the
whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wits
ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting
each moment t'be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and
snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and
men, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever s'high above me,
struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them
call out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated,
spear in hand, upon some jutting rock104 throws bait int'the water to
deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with
which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on t'the land as he
catches them one by one—even s'did Scylla land these panting creatures
on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they
screamed and stretched out their hands t'me in their mortal agony.
This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.

insolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very
strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem t'be made of iron,
and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you
will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this
island, but bid them put out t'sea and g'faring fruitlessly on
through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds
blow hardest and d's'much damage; how can we escape should one of
those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which s'often
wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,
therefore, let us obey the behests of night and prepare our supper here
hard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will g'on board again and put
out t'sea.'
"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that
heaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me t'yield, for you
are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his
solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of
sheep, he will not be s'mad as t'kill a single head of either, but
will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'
"They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath
we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh
water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as
they had had enough t'eat and drink, they began talking about their
poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them
weeping and they went on crying till they fell off int'a sound sleep.
"In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their
places, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane s'that
land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out
of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
appeared, we brought the ship t'land and drew her int'a cave wherein
the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men
together in council.
"'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us
mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it;
for these cattle and sheep belong t'the mighty sun, wh'sees and gives
ear t'everything.' And again they promised that they would obey.
"For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was
n'other wind, but only South and East.105 As long as corn and wine
held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,
however, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to
g'further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking
whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One
day, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven t'show me
some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough t'be clear of
all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the
wind, I washed my hands and prayed t'all the gods in Olympus till by
and by they sent me off int'a sweet sleep.
"Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel t'the men, 'Listen
t'me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there
is none s'bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these
cows and offer them in sacrifice t'the immortal gods? If we ever get
back t'Ithaca, we can build a fine temple t'the sun-god and enrich it
with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined t'sink our
ship out of revenge for these horned cattle, and the other gods are of
the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and
have done with it, than be starved t'death by inches in such a desert
island as this is.'
"Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,
s'fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men,
therefore, drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them
saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of
barley-meal, for there was n'barley left. When they had done praying
they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the
thigh bones, wrapped them round in tw'layers of fat, and set some
pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had n'wine with which t'make
drink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, s'they kept
pouring on a little water from time t'time while the inward meats were
being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had
tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces
upon the spits.
"By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back t'the ship
and t'the sea shore. As I drew near I began t'smell hot roast meat,
s'I groaned out a prayer t'the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I
exclaimed, 'and all you other gods wh'live in everlasting bliss, you
have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep int'which you have sent me;
see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my absence.'
"Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off t'the sun and told him we had
been killing his cows, whereon he flew int'a great rage, and said to
the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods wh'live in
everlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:
they have had the insolence t'kill my cows, which were the one thing I
loved t'look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If
they d'not square accounts with me about my cows, I will g'down to
Hades and shine there among the dead.'
"'Sun,' said Jove, 'g'on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over
the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship int'little pieces with a
bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out t'sea.'
"I was told all this by Calypso, wh'said she had heard it from the
mouth of Mercury.
"As soon as I got down t'my ship and t'the sea shore I rebuked each
one of the men separately, but we could see n'way out of it, for the
cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once t'show signs
and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and
the joints upon the spits began t'low like cows, and the meat, whether
cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.`,length:6153,num_lines:95,location:"Desolate Island",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Eurylochus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"He leads the dissent among the men.",emotion:"Defiant and desperate",sentiment:-.5,quote:"'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem t'be made of iron.'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Odysseus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"He is the leader trying to maintain order.",emotion:"Frustrated and concerned",sentiment:-.3,quote:"'You force me t'yield, for you are many against one.'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Lampetie",importance:.6,importance_exp:"She informs the sun about the cows being killed.",emotion:"Angry and vengeful",sentiment:-.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Lampetie expresses her anger to the sun about the crew's actions.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Jove",importance:.7,importance_exp:"He decides the fate of Ulysses' crew.",emotion:"Indifferent and vengeful",sentiment:-.6,quote:"'I will shiver their ship int'little pieces with a bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out t'sea.'",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:8,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"The Storm and Shipwreck",summary:"Jove punishes the crew, leading to their shipwreck.",chapter:"BOOK XII",first_line:307,last_line:330,explanation:"Location changes to the sea after leaving the island.",text:`"For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon

Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered
cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous
began t'speak.
"Ulysses," said he, "now that you have reached my house I doubt not you
will get home without further misadventure n'matter how much you have
suffered in the past. T'you others, however, wh'come here night after
night t'drink my choicest wine and listen t'my bard, I would insist
as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought
gold,108 and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;
let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a
large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a
general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected t'bear the
burden of such a handsome present."
Every one approved of this, and then they went home t'bed each in his
own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they
hurried down t'the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.
Alcinous went on board and saw everything s'securely stowed under the
ship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.
Then they went t'the house of Alcinous t'get dinner, and he
sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove wh'is the lord of all.
They set the steaks t'grill and made an excellent dinner, after which
the inspired bard, Demodocus, wh'was a favourite with every one, sang
t'them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as
though t'hasten his setting, for he was longing t'be on his way. As
one wh'has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen
keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he
may g'and get it, for it is all his legs can d't'carry him, even so
did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said t'the
Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly t'King Alcinous:
"Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me
on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving
me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may
turn t'good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace
among friends,109 and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction
t'your wives and children;110 may heaven vouchsafe you every good
grace, and may n'evil thing come among your people."
Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and
agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken
reasonably. Alcinous therefore said t'his servant, "Pontonous, mix
some wine and hand it round t'everybody, that we may offer a prayer to
father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way."
Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it t'every one in turn; the others
each from his own seat made a drink-offering t'the blessed gods that
live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands
of queen Arete.
"Farewell, queen," said he, "henceforward and for ever, till age and
death, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take
my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and
with king Alcinous."
As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to
conduct him t'his ship and t'the sea shore. Arete als'sent some
maidservants with him—one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to
carry his strong box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to
the water side the crew took these things and put them on board, with
all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen
sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.
Then he to'went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew
took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone
t'which it had been bound.

The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies
over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it
were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water
seethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a
falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus,
then, she cut her way through the water, carrying one wh'was as
cunning as the gods, but wh'was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of
all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves
of the weary sea.
When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began t'show,
the ship drew near t'land.112 Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the
old merman Phorcys, which lies between tw'points that break the line
of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of
wind and sea that rage outside, s'that, when once within it, a ship
may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is
a large olive tree, and at n'great distance a fine overarching cavern
sacred t'the nymphs wh'are called Naiads.113 There are mixing bowls
within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,
there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of
sea purple—very curious t'see—and at all times there is water within
it. It has tw'entrances, one facing North by which mortals can g'down
int'the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more

Int'this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the
place.114 She had s'much way upon her that she ran half her own length
on t'the shore;115 when, however, they had landed, the first thing
they did was t'lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the
ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took
out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians t'give him
when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all
together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear
some passer by116 might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and
then they made the best of their way home again.`,length:2278,num_lines:35,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.1,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character, central to the scene",emotion:"Peaceful and restful",sentiment:1,quote:"Ulysses fell int'a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Phaeacians",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Important for their actions regarding Ulysses",emotion:"Caring and cautious",sentiment:1,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"The Phaeacians carefully lifted Ulysses and placed him on the sand, showing their concern for his well-being.",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:6},{title:"Neptune's Anger 2",summary:"Neptune plots revenge against the Phaeacians.",chapter:"BOOK XIII",first_line:96,last_line:128,explanation:"Location changes to Neptune's realm.",text:`But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already
threatened Ulysses, s'he took counsel with Jove. "Father Jove," said
he, "I shall n'longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods,
if mortals like the Phaeacians, wh'are my own flesh and blood, show
such small regard for me. I said I would let Ulysses get home when he
had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home
at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it, and
promised that he should d'so; but now they have brought him in a ship
fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more
magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever
have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and
got home without misadventure."
And Jove answered, "What, 'Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking
about? The gods are by n'means wanting in respect for you. It would be
monstrous were they t'insult one s'old and honoured as you are. As
regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and
treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself t'deal
with him as you may think proper, s'd'just as you please."
"I should have done s'at once," replied Neptune, "if I were not
anxious t'avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I
should like t'wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its
escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I
should als'like t'bury their city under a huge mountain."
"My good friend," answered Jove, "I should recommend you at the very
moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,
t'turn it int'a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will
astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the
mountain."
When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went t'Scheria where the
Phaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid
way, had got close in. Then he went up t'it, turned it int'stone, and
drove it down with the flat of his hand s'as t'root it in the ground.

more upon his own soil. He had been s'long away that he did not know
it again; moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so

him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and
friends recognising him119 until he had taken his revenge upon the
wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to
him—the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the
goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his
native land. S'he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and
cried aloud despairingly.

Then Minerva came up t'him
disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a
good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her
comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he
saw her, and went straight up t'her.
"My friend," said he, "you are the first person whom I have met with in
this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you t'be well disposed
towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your
knees and pray t'you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell
me truly, what land and country is this? Wh'are its inhabitants? Am I
on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?"
Minerva answered, "Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come
from somewhere a long way off, not t'know what country this is. It is
a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is
rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by n'means a bad
island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also
wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle als'and
goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places
where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known
even as far as Troy, which I understand t'be a long way off from this
Achaean country."
Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own
country, and he began t'answer, but he did not speak the truth, and
made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.
"I heard of Ithaca," said he, "when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and
now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as
much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed
Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him
because he wanted t'rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so
much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of
the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as
vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, s'I lay in wait
for him with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as
he was coming int'town from the country. It was a very dark night and
nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but
as soon as I had done s'I went t'a ship and besought the owners, who
were Phoenicians, t'take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis
where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.
They meant n'guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we
sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could d't'get
inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we
wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were.
I was very tired and fell asleep directly, s'they took my goods out of
the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand.
Then they sailed away t'Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress
of mind."
Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.
Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, "He must be
indeed a shifty lying fellow," said she, "wh'could surpass you in all
manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare
devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not
drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are
in your own country again? We will say n'more, however, about this,
for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are the most
accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for
diplomacy and subtlety have n'equal among the gods. Did you not know
Jove's daughter Minerva—me, wh'have been ever with you, wh'kept watch
over you in all your troubles, and wh'made the Phaeacians take so
great a liking t'you? And now, again, I am come here t'talk things
over with you, and help you t'hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians
give you; I want t'tell you about the troubles that await you in your
own house; you have got t'face them, but tell n'one, neither man nor
woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, and put up with
every man's insolence, without a word."
And Ulysses answered, "A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you
are s'constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is
a hard matter for him t'know whether it is you or not. This much,
however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind t'me as long as
we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we
went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven
dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw n'more of you, and cannot
ever remember your coming t'my ship t'help me in a difficulty; I had
t'wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I
reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me
int'the town.120 And now, I beseech you in your father's name, tell me
the truth, for I d'not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in
some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you
have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back t'my own
country?"
"You are always taking something of that sort in your head," replied
Minerva, "and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you
are s'plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning
from s'long a voyage would at once have gone home t'see his wife and
children, but you d'not seem t'care about asking after them or
hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who
remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having n'peace night or
day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near
you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back
safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to
quarrel with my uncle Neptune, wh'never forgave you for having blinded
his son.121 I will now, however, point out t'you the lie of the land,
and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old
merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of
it; [near it is the cave sacred t'the Naiads;122 here to'is the
overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable
hecatomb t'the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum."
As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then
Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed
the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed t'the nymphs,
saying, "Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never
again t'see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving
salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if
Jove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to
manhood."
"Take heart, and d'not trouble yourself about that," rejoined Minerva,
"let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where
they will be quite safe.

"Ulysses," said Minerva, "noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay
hands on these disreputable people wh'have been lording it in your
house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents
t'her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and
sending encouraging messages123 t'every one of them, but meaning the
very opposite of all she says."
And Ulysses answered, "In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have
come t'much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you
had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best
avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage int'my heart as
on the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow. Help me now
as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess,
will be with me."
"Trust me for that," said she, "I will not lose sight of you when once
we set about it, and I imagine that some of those wh'are devouring
your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and
brains. I will begin by disguising you s'that n'human being shall
know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your
yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all wh'see
it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an
unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the
son whom you left behind you. Then g'at once t'the swineherd wh'is
in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you,
and is devoted t'Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his
pigs near the rock that is called Raven124 by the fountain Arethusa,
where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their
manner. Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I
proceed t'Sparta and see your son, wh'is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon,
where he has gone t'try and find out whether you are still alive."125
"But why," said Ulysses, "did you not tell him, for you knew all about
it? Did you want him to't'g'sailing about amid all kinds of hardship
while others are eating up his estate?"
Minerva answered, "Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be
well spoken of for having gone. He is in n'sort of difficulty, but is
staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with
abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out t'sea and are lying
in wait for him, for they mean t'kill him before he can get home. I do
not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those wh'are
now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves."
As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with
wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over
his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine
ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him,
and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she als'gave
him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with
a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to
sling it over his shoulder.

Ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the
wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the
place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, wh'was
the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his
hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be
seen from far. He had made them spacious126 and fair t'see, with a
free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his
master's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,
without saying anything t'Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them
on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of
oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had
built twelve styes near one another for the sows t'lie in. There were
fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the
boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept
on eating them, and the swineherd had t'send them the best he had
continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the
herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always
with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of
sandals127 from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding
the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth t'town
with a boar that he had been forced t'send the suitors that they might
sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.
When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at
him, but Ulysses was cunning enough t'sit down and loose his hold of
the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by
them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,
rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off
by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said t'Ulysses, "Old
man, the dogs were likely t'have made short work of you, and then you
would have got me int'trouble. The gods have given me quite enough
worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in
continual grief on his account. I have t'attend swine for other people
t'eat, while he, if he yet lives t'see the light of day, is starving
in some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill
of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your
misfortunes."
On this the swineherd led the way int'the hut and bade him sit down.`,length:2515,num_lines:38,location:"Ulysses' Hut With Eumaeus",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Cunning and cautious",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Ulysses is cautious as he approaches the hut, aware of the danger posed by the dogs.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Concerned and loyal",sentiment:.4,quote:"Old man, the dogs were likely t'have made short work of you, and then you would have got me int'trouble.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Dinner Preparations",summary:"Eumaeus prepares a meal for Ulysses.",chapter:"BOOK XIV",first_line:39,last_line:350,explanation:"Transition to inside the hut for dinner.",text:`He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of
this he threw the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he
used t'sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,
and said "May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your
heart's desire in return for the kind way in which you have received
me."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Stranger, though a still
poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me t'insult
him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what
you can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have
young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for
heaven has hindered the return of him wh'would have been always good
t'me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of land, a good
looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who
has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as
they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown
old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I
wish that Helen's whole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been
the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to
Ilius, the land of noble steeds, t'fight the Trojans in the cause of
king Agamemnon."
As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went t'the styes where
the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out tw'which he brought
back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted
them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before
Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over
with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of
ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him t'begin.
"Fall to, stranger," said he, "on a dish of servant's pork. The fat
pigs have t'g't'the suitors, wh'eat them up without shame or
scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and
respect those wh'd'what is lawful and right. Even the fierce
freebooters wh'g'raiding on other people's land, and Jove gives them
their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and got home
again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but
some god seems t'have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone;
they will not, therefore, g'back t'their own homes and make their
offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force,
without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they
sacrifice not one victim nor tw'only, and they take the run of his
wine, for he was exceedingly rich. N'other great man either in Ithaca
or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men
put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of
cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also
twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him
twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even
large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the
charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the
best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the
pigs that you see here, and I have t'keep picking out the best I have
and sending it t'them."
This was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously
without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was
satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,
filled it with wine, and gave it t'Ulysses, wh'was pleased, and said
as he took it in his hands, "My friend, wh'was this master of yours
that bought you and paid for you, s'rich and s'powerful as you tell
me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me wh'he
was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods
know, but I may be able t'give you news of him, for I have travelled
much."
Eumaeus answered, "Old man, n'traveller wh'comes here with news will
get Ulysses' wife and son t'believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in
want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a
word of truth; every one wh'finds his way t'Ithaca goes t'my
mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes
much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the
time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old
man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty
story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to
pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones are
lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone,
and a bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go
where I may I shall never find s'good a master, not even if I were to
g'home t'my mother and father where I was bred and born. I d'not so
much care, however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like
t'see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that
grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is
here n'longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me
that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory."
"My friend," replied Ulysses, "you are very positive, and very hard of
belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will not
merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. D'not give me anything
for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and
cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take
anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,
wh'lets his poverty tempt him int'lying. I swear by king Jove, by the
rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses t'which I have now
come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will
return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the
beginning of the next he will be here t'd'vengeance on all those who
are ill treating his wife and son."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Old man, you will neither
get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink
your wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. D'not keep
on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks
about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I
only wish he may come, as d'Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his
son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy to'about this same boy of his;
he was running up fast int'manhood, and bade fare t'be n'worse man,
face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has
been unsettling his mind, s'he has gone off t'Pylos t'try and get
news of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is
coming home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a
name in Ithaca. But let us say n'more about him, and leave him t'be
taken, or else t'escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him
t'protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also,
for I want t'know, wh'you are and where you come from. Tell me of
your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew
brought you t'Ithaca, and from what country they professed t'come—for
you cannot have come by land."
And Ulysses answered, "I will tell you all about it. If there were meat
and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing t'do
but t'eat and drink while the others g't'their work, I could easily
talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of
the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven t'visit me.
"I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well t'd'man, wh'had many
sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had
purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax
(whose lineage I claim, and wh'was held in the highest honour among
the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put
me on the same level with my brothers wh'had been born in wedlock.
When, however, death took him t'the house of Hades, his sons divided
his estate and cast lots for their shares, but t'me they gave a
holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me t'marry
int'a rich family, for I was not given t'bragging, or shirking on the
field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw
you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to
spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my
men t'surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death s'much
as a thought, but was the first t'leap forward and spear all whom I
could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm
work, nor the frugal home life of those wh'would bring up children. My
delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things that most
men shudder t'think of; but one man likes one thing and another
another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the
Achaeans went t'Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on
foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil
in the first instance, and much more was allotted t'me later on.
"My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but
when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which s'many
perished, the people required me and Idomeneus t'lead their ships to
Troy, and there was n'way out of it, for they insisted on our doing
so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked
the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it
was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily
with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of
making a descent on Egypt, s'I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.
I had nine ships, and the people flocked t'fill them. For six days I
and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice
t'the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board
and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were
going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had
n'sickness on board, but sat where we were and let the ships g'as the
wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river
Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay
by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts t'reconnoitre
from every point of vantage.
"But the men disobeyed my orders, took t'their own devices, and
ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their
wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried t'the city, and
when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the
plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of
armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would n'longer
face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians
killed many of us, and took the rest alive t'd'forced labour for
them. Jove, however, put it in my mind t'd'thus—and I wish I had died
then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for
me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand;
then I went straight up t'the king's chariot, clasped his knees and
kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get int'his chariot,
and took me weeping t'his own home. Many made at me with their ashen
spears and tried t'kill me in their fury, but the king protected me,
for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who
punishes those wh'd'evil.
"I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the
Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on
for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who
had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me
over int'going with him t'Phoenicia, where his house and his
possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the
end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season
had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a
pretence that I was t'take a carg'along with him t'that place, but
really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I
suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not
help it.
"The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea
that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled
their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could
see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and
the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts
and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and
brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all int'the sea;
they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so
many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of
getting home again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship's
mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung t'it, and
drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the
darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on t'the Thesprotian
coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably
without charging me anything at all—for his son found me when I was
nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand,
took me t'his father's house and gave me clothes t'wear.
"There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had
entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his
homeward journey. He showed me als'the treasure of gold, and wrought
iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough t'keep his family
for ten generations, s'much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.
But the king said Ulysses had gone t'Dodona that he might learn Jove's
mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after s'long an
absence he should return t'Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the
king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as
he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,
that should take him t'his own country. He sent me off however before
Ulysses returned, for there happened t'be a Thesprotian ship sailing
for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge
of her t'be sure and take me safely t'King Acastus.
"These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me t'the
very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from
land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the
shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered
old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they
reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a
strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore t'get supper by
the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn
my rags over my head I slid down the rudder int'the sea, where I
struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near
a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my
having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they
thought it was n'further use and went back t'their ship. The gods,
having hidden me thus easily, then took me t'a good man's door—for it
seems that I am not t'die yet awhile."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Poor unhappy stranger, I
have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but
that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to
believe it. Why should a man like you g'about telling lies in this
way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of
them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him
die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;
for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his
son would have been heir t'his renown, but now the storm winds have
spirited him away we know not whither.
"As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never g'to
the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news
about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those
wh'grieve over the king's absence, and those wh'rejoice at it because
they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I
have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was
taken in by an Aetolian, wh'had killed a man and come a long way till
at last he reached my station, and I was very kind t'him. He said he
had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships
which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the
following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back
much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has
brought you t'my door, d'not try t'flatter me in this way with vain
hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but
only out of respect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and
pitying you."
Ulysses answered, "I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have
given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a
bargain, and call all the gods in heaven t'witness it. If your master
comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to
Dulichium where I want t'go; but if he does not come as I say he will,
set your men on t'me, and tell them t'throw me from yonder precipice,
as a warning t'tramps not t'g'about the country telling lies."
"And a pretty figure I should cut then," replied Eumaeus, "both now and
hereafter, if I were t'kill you after receiving you int'my hut and
showing you hospitality. I should have t'say my prayers in good
earnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will
come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper."
Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the
pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a
tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven int'them. But
Eumaeus called t'his men and said, "Bring in the best pig you have,
that I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of
him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs,
while others reap the fruit of our labour."
On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine
fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not
forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, s'the first
thing he did was t'cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them
int'the fire, praying t'all the gods as he did s'that Ulysses might
return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which
he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it,
while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and
Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on t'some of the
fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers;
they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits
and roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the
spits they threw them on t'the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who
was a most equitable man, then stood up t'give every one his share. He
made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of
Maia and the nymphs, praying t'them as he did so; the others he dealt
out t'the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways
down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much
pleased. "I hope, Eumaeus," said he, "that Jove will be as well
disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing t'an
outcast like myself."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Eat, my good fellow, and
enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,
just as he thinks right, for he can d'whatever he chooses."
As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt
sacrifice t'the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put
the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down t'his own portion.
Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man
on his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence,
and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either
t'his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good
things that were before them, and when they had had enough t'eat and
drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all
went t'bed after having made a hearty supper.`,length:20811,num_lines:312,location:"Ulysses' Hut With Eumaeus",importance:.9,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character, protagonist",emotion:"Brooding and vengeful",sentiment:-.5,quote:`Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome, and said "May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your heart's desire in return for the kind way in which you have received me."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character, swineherd",emotion:"Nostalgic and sorrowful",sentiment:-.7,quote:"I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is here n'longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Nightfall and Rest",summary:"Ulysses and Eumaeus settle down for the night.",chapter:"BOOK XIV",first_line:351,last_line:410,explanation:"Transition to nighttime activities.",text:`Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was n'moon. It
poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which
is a wet quarter, s'Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in
the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and
give it him, or make one of his men give him one. "Listen t'me," said
he, "Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell
you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will
make even a wise man fall t'singing; it will make him chuckle and
dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as
I have begun, I will g'on. Would that I were still young and strong as
when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the
leaders, but I was in command also, for the other tw'would have it so.
When we had come up t'the wall of the city we crouched down beneath
our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood
that grew about the swamp. It came on t'freeze with a North wind
blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields
were coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts,
and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders,
but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I
should be to'cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and
shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted
their places, I nudged Ulysses wh'was close t'me with my elbow, and
he at once gave me his ear.
"'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no
cloak; some god fooled me int'setting off with nothing on but my
shirt, and I d'not know what t'do.'
"Ulysses, wh'was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following
plan:
"'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'
Then he raised his head on his elbow.
"'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We
are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would g'down and tell
Agamemnon t'send us up more men at once.'
"On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running
t'the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough
till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in
those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak
both out of good will and for the respect due t'a brave soldier; but
now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby."
And Eumaeus answered, "Old man, you have told us an excellent story,
and have said nothing s'far but what is quite satisfactory; for the
present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else
that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow
morning you have t'shake your own old rags about your body again, for
we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has
only one. When Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both
cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want t'go."
With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some
goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here
Ulysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak
that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.
Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the
swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, s'he got ready to
g'outside, and Ulysses was glad t'see that he looked after his
property during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his
brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak t'keep out the wind. He also
took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of
attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went t'his rest where the
pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from
the North wind.`,length:3873,num_lines:60,location:"Stormy Night",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Nostalgic and vulnerable",sentiment:.2,quote:"Would that I were still young and strong as when we got up an ambuscade before Troy.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character providing care",emotion:"Caring and practical",sentiment:.5,quote:"Old man, you have told us an excellent story, and have said nothing s'far but what is quite satisfactory; for the present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Minerva's Visit to Telemachus",summary:"Minerva visits Telemachus in Lacedaemon.",chapter:"BOOK XV",first_line:1,last_line:34,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`MINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON—HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS

in the forecourt of Menelaus's house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but
Telemachus could get n'rest all night for thinking of his unhappy

will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a

find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father
and brothers are already urging her t'marry Eurymachus, wh'has given
her more than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his
wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the
house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they always want to
d'the best they can for the man wh'marries them, and never give
another thought t'the children of their first husband, nor t'their
father either when he is dead and done with. G'home, therefore, and
put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you
have, until it shall please heaven t'send you a wife of your own. Let
me tell you als'of another matter which you had better attend to. The
chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait128
between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean t'kill you before you can
reach home. I d'not much think they will succeed; it is more likely
that some of those wh'are now eating up your property will find a
grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from
the islands; the god wh'watches over you and protects you will send
you a fair wind. As soon as you get t'Ithaca send your ship and men on
t'the town, but yourself g'straight t'the swineherd wh'has charge
of your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him,

his heel t'rouse him, and said, "Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the

in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought
his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good
bye t'us in the usual way. S'long as he lives a guest should never
forget a host wh'has shown him kindness."
As he spoke day began t'break, and Menelaus, wh'had already risen,
leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put
on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his
shoulders, and went out t'meet him. "Menelaus," said he, "let me go
back now t'my own country, for I want t'get home."
And Menelaus answered, "Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not
detain you. I d'not like t'see a host either to'fond of his guest or
to'rude t'him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a
man g'when he wants t'd's'is as bad as telling him t'g'if he
would like t'stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in
the house and speed him when he wants t'leave it. Wait, then, till I
can get your beautiful presents int'your chariot, and till you have
yourself seen them. I will tell the women t'prepare a sufficient
dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once
more proper and cheaper for you t'get your dinner before setting out
on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a

conduct you myself through all our principal cities. N'one will send
us away empty handed; every one will give us something—a bronze tripod,
a couple of mules, or a gold cup."
"Menelaus," replied Telemachus, "I want t'g'home at once, for when I

prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At
this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got
up; s'Menelaus told him t'light the fire and cook some meat, which he
at once did. Then Menelaus went down int'his fragrant store room,130
not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the
place where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double
cup, and told his son Megapenthes t'bring als'a silver mixing bowl.
Meanwhile Helen went t'the chest where she kept the lovely dresses
which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was
largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered
like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. 131 Then they all
came back through the house again till they got t'Telemachus, and
Menelaus said, "Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring
you safely home according t'your desire. I will now present you with
the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a
mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,
and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a
present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on
my return home. I should like t'give it t'you."
With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,
while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before
him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.
"I too, my son," said she, "have something for you as a keepsake from
the hand of Helen; it is for your bride t'wear upon her wedding day.
Till then, get your dear mother t'keep it for you; thus may you go
back rejoicing t'your own country and t'your home."
S'saying she gave the robe over t'him and he received it gladly. Then
Pisistratus put the presents int'the chariot, and admired them all as
he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus int'the
house, and they both of them sat down t'table. A maid servant brought
them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it int'a silver
basin for them t'wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside
them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good
things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and
gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine.
Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,
but as soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink Telemachus and
Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot.
They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing
gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came after them with a
golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a
drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and

gave his orders. "Now, my men," said he, "get everything in order on
board the ship, and let us set out home."
Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as
Telemachus was thus busied, praying als'and sacrificing t'Minerva in
the ship's stern, there came t'him a man from a distant country, a
seer, wh'was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was
descended from Melampus, wh'used t'live in Pylos, the land of sheep;
he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven int'exile by
the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held
them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the
house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of
the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow
that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped
with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace t'Pylos, avenged the
wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus t'his
brother. Then he left the country and went t'Argos, where it was
ordained that he should reign over much people. There he married,
established himself, and had tw'famous sons Antiphates and Mantius.
Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, wh'was
dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live t'old
age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts. His sons
were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was
father t'Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off
Cleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals,
but Apoll'made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now
that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to
live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men.
His son, Theoclymenus, it was wh'now came up t'Telemachus as he was
making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. "Friend," said he, "now
that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your
sacrifices themselves, and by the god t'whom you make them, I pray you
als'by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth
and nothing but the truth. Wh'and whence are you? Tell me als'of your
town and parents."
Telemachus said, "I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and
my father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come
t'some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew
together t'see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a
long time."
"I too," answered Theoclymenus, "am an exile, for I have killed a man
of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they
have great power among the Argives. I am flying t'escape death at
their hands, and am thus doomed t'be a wanderer on the face of the
earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that
they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."

hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had t'eat and
drink, Ulysses began trying t'prove the swineherd and see whether he
would continue t'treat him kindly, and ask him t'stay on at the
station or pack him off t'the city; s'he said:
"Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want t'g'away and begin begging
about the town, s'as t'be n'more trouble t'you or t'your men. Give
me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide t'g'with me
and show me the way. I will g'the round of the city begging as I needs
must, t'see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I
should like als't'g't'the house of Ulysses and bring news of her
husband t'Queen Penelope. I could then g'about among the suitors and
see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should
soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and
believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury wh'gives grace
and good name t'the works of all men, there is n'one living wh'would
make a more handy servant than I should—t'put fresh wood on the fire,
chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and d'all those services that
poor men have t'd'for their betters."
The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. "Heaven help
me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion as that into
your head? If you g'near the suitors you will be undone t'a
certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They
would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their
servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and
shirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables
are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay
where you are, then; you are not in anybody's way; I d'not mind your
being here, n'more d'any of the others, and when Telemachus comes
home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you
want t'go."
Ulysses answered, "I hope you may be as dear t'the gods as you are to
me, for having saved me from going about and getting int'trouble;
there is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men
have once got low down in the world they will g'through a great deal
on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to
stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses'
mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he
set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in
the house of Hades?"
"I will tell you all about them," replied Eumaeus, "Laertes is still
living and prays heaven t'let him depart peacefully in his own house,
for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also
about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him
more than anything else did. She came t'an unhappy end133 through
sorrow for her son: may n'friend or neighbour wh'has dealt kindly by
me come t'such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,
though she was always grieving, I used t'like seeing her and asking
her how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,
the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she
made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they
sent Ctimene t'Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me,
my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for
my feet, and sent me off int'the country, but she was just as fond of
me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to
prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough t'eat
and drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who
comes here; but there is n'getting a kind word or deed out of my
mistress, for the house has fallen int'the hands of wicked people.
Servants want sometimes t'see their mistress and have a talk with her;
they like t'have something t'eat and drink at the house, and
something to't'take back with them int'the country. This is what
will keep servants in a good humour."
Ulysses answered, "Then you must have been a very little fellow,
Eumaeus, when you were taken s'far away from your home and parents.
Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother
lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you
were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for
whatever your master gave them?"

yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen t'me. The nights are
now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and
sitting up talking together; you ought not t'g't'bed till bed time,

In the mean time Telemachus and his
crew were nearing land, s'they loosed the sails, took down the mast,
and rowed the ship int'the harbour.136 They cast out their mooring
stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,
mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough
t'eat and drink Telemachus said, "Take the ship on t'the town, but
leave me here, for I want t'look after the herdsmen on one of my
farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to
the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give
you all a good dinner with meat and wine." 137
Then Theoclymenus said, "And what, my dear young friend, is t'become
of me? T'whose house, among all your chief men, am I t'repair? or
shall I g'straight t'your own house and t'your mother?"
"At any other time," replied Telemachus, "I should have bidden you go
t'my own house, for you would find n'want of hospitality; at the
present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I
shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show
herself even t'the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper
chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can
g'to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, wh'is held in the highest
estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most
persistent wooer, of all those wh'are paying court t'my mother and
trying t'take Ulysses' place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows
whether or n'they will come t'a bad end before the marriage takes
place."
As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo's
messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore
them off,138 fell t'the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.
On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.
"Telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your right hand
without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew
it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there
will be n'house in Ithaca more royal than your own."
"I wish it may prove so," answered Telemachus. "If it does, I will show
you s'much good will and give you s'many presents that all wh'meet
you will congratulate you."
Then he said t'his friend Piraeus, "Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have
throughout shown yourself the most willing t'serve me of all those who
have accompanied me t'Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to
your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him."
And Piraeus answered, "Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you
please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find n'lack of
hospitality."
As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others d's'als'and loose
the hawsers, s'they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus
bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of
sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the
hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as
they had been told t'do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he
could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine
were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, wh'was so
devoted a servant t'his master.`,length:3336,num_lines:52,location:"Harbour",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Main character making decisions",emotion:"determined and hopeful",sentiment:.5,quote:"Take the ship on t'the town, but leave me here, for I want t'look after the herdsmen on one of my farms.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Theoclymenus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Significant role as an omen interpreter",emotion:"anxious yet hopeful",sentiment:.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Theoclymenus feels anxious yet hopeful, interpreting a bird's flight as a sign from the gods.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Piraeus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Supportive friend of Telemachus",emotion:"loyal and supportive",sentiment:.7,quote:"Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find n'lack of hospitality.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:10,importance_rank:8,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Ulysses and Telemachus Meet",summary:"Ulysses reveals himself to Telemachus in the hut.",chapter:"BOOK XVI",first_line:1,last_line:135,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF T'TELEMACHUS.
Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were
were getting breakfast ready at daybreak, for they had sent the men out
with the pigs. When Telemachus came up, the dogs did not bark but
fawned upon him, s'Ulysses, hearing the sound of feet and noticing
that the dogs did not bark, said t'Eumaeus:
"Eumaeus, I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of
your acquaintance is coming here, for the dogs are fawning upon him and
not barking."
The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the
door. Eumaeus sprang t'his feet, and the bowls in which he was mixing
wine fell from his hands, as he made towards his master. He kissed his
head and both his beautiful eyes, and wept for joy. A father could not
be more delighted at the return of an only son, the child of his old
age, after ten years' absence in a foreign country and after having
gone through much hardship. He embraced him, kissed him all over as
though he had come back from the dead, and spoke fondly t'him saying:
"S'you are come, Telemachus, light of my eyes that you are. When I
heard you had gone t'Pylos I made sure I was never going t'see you
any more. Come in, my dear child, and sit down, that I may have a good
look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into
the country t'see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close t'the town
generally. I suppose you think it better t'keep an eye on what the
suitors are doing."
"S'be it, old friend," answered Telemachus, "but I am come now because
I want t'see you, and t'learn whether my mother is still at her old
home or whether some one else has married her, s'that the bed of
Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs."
"She is still at the house," replied Eumaeus, "grieving and breaking
her heart, and doing nothing but weep, both night and day continually."
As he spoke he took Telemachus' spear, whereon he crossed the stone
threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat t'give him place
as he entered, but Telemachus checked him; "Sit down, stranger," said
he, "I can easily find another seat, and there is one here wh'will lay
it for me."
Ulysses went back t'his own place, and Eumaeus strewed some green
brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for
Telemachus t'sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of
cold meat, the remains from what they had eaten the day before, and he
filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine
als'in bowls of ivy-wood, and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they
laid their hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon
as they had had enough t'eat and drink Telemachus said t'Eumaeus,
"Old friend, where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring
him t'Ithaca, and wh'were they?—for assuredly he did not come here by
land."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "My son, I will tell you the
real truth. He says he is a Cretan, and that he has been a great
traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,
and has taken refuge at my station, s'I will put him int'your hands.
D'whatever you like with him, only remember that he is your
suppliant."
"I am very much distressed," said Telemachus, "by what you have just
told me. How can I take this stranger int'my house? I am as yet young,
and am not strong enough t'hold my own if any man attacks me. My
mother cannot make up her mind whether t'stay where she is and look
after the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her
husband, or whether the time is now come for her t'take the best man
of those wh'are wooing her, and the one wh'will make her the most
advantageous offer; still, as the stranger has come t'your station I
will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear, with a sword and sandals,
and will send him wherever he wants t'go. Or if you like you can keep
him here at the station, and I will send him clothes and food that he
may be n'burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go
near the suitors, for they are very insolent, and are sure t'ill treat
him in a way that would greatly grieve me; n'matter how valiant a man
may be he can d'nothing against numbers, for they will be to'strong
for him."
Then Ulysses said, "Sir, it is right that I should say something
myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent
way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you
are. Tell me, d'you submit t'such treatment tamely, or has some god
set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers—for
it is t'these that a man may look for support, however great his
quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present
mind; if I were son t'Ulysses, or, indeed, Ulysses himself, I would
rather some one came and cut my head off, but I would g't'the house
and be the bane of every one of these men.139 If they were to'many for
me—I being single-handed—I would rather die fighting in my own house
than see such disgraceful sights day after day, strangers grossly
maltreated, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an
unseemly way, wine drawn recklessly, and bread wasted all t'n'purpose
for an end that shall never be accomplished."
And Telemachus answered, "I will tell you truly everything. There is no
enmity between me and my people, nor can I complain of brothers, to
whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove
has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius,
and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses
wh'left me behind him when he went away, s'that I have never been of
any use t'him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of
numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands,
Dulichium, Same, Zacynthus, as als'all the principal men of Ithaca
itself, are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court t'my
mother, wh'will neither say point blank that she will not marry, nor
yet bring matters t'an end, s'they are making havoc of my estate, and
before long will d's'with myself int'the bargain. The issue,
however, rests with heaven. But d'you, old friend Eumaeus, g'at once
and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it
t'herself alone, and then come back here without letting any one else
know, for there are many wh'are plotting mischief against me."
"I understand and heed you," replied Eumaeus; "you need instruct me no
further, only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let
poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used t'superintend the
work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses, and he
would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me
that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten
nor drunk as he ought t'do, nor does he look after his farm, but sits
weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones."
"More's the pity," answered Telemachus, "I am sorry for him, but we
must leave him t'himself just now. If people could have everything
their own way, the first thing I should choose would be the return of
my father; but go, and give your message; then make haste back again,
and d'not turn out of your way t'tell Laertes. Tell my mother t'send
one of her women secretly with the news at once, and let him hear it
from her."
Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus, therefore, took his sandals,
bound them t'his feet, and started for the town. Minerva watched him
well off the station, and then came up t'it in the form of a
woman—fair, stately, and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,
and revealed herself t'Ulysses, but Telemachus could not see her, and
knew not that she was there, for the gods d'not let themselves be seen
by everybody. Ulysses saw her, and s'did the dogs, for they did not
bark, but went scared and whining off t'the other side of the yards.
She nodded her head and motioned t'Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon
he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the
yards. Then she said t'him:
"Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is now time for you t'tell your
son: d'not keep him in the dark any longer, but lay your plans for the
destruction of the suitors, and then make for the town. I will not be
long in joining you, for I to'am eager for the fray."
As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a
fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him
younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,
filled out his cheeks, and let his beard become dark again. Then she
went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded`,length:8723,num_lines:135,location:"Ulysses' Hut With Eumaeus",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character revealing himself",emotion:"Joyful and proud",sentiment:1,quote:"Ulysses saw her, and s'did the dogs, for they did not bark, but went scared and whining off t'the other side of the yards.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character receiving his father",emotion:"Surprised and emotional",sentiment:1,quote:"I can easily find another seat, and there is one here wh'will lay it for me.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character facilitating the reunion",emotion:"Joyful and supportive",sentiment:1,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Eumaeus feels joyful and supportive, sharing news of Penelope's enduring love and grief.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Eumaeus Delivers News",summary:"Eumaeus goes to inform Penelope about Telemachus's return.",chapter:"BOOK XVI",first_line:136,last_line:250,explanation:"Change of location to Penelope's house.",text:`when he saw him, and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking
upon a god.
"Stranger," said he, "how suddenly you have changed from what you were
a moment or tw'ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not
the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If
so, be propitious t'me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings
of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me."
And Ulysses said, "I am n'god, why should you take me for one? I am
your father, on whose account you grieve and suffer s'much at the
hands of lawless men."
As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on t'the
ground, for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could
not yet believe that it was his father, and said:
"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes
that I may grieve the more hereafter; n'mortal man could of himself
contrive t'd'as you have been doing, and make yourself old and young
at a moment's notice, unless a god were with him. A second ag'you were
old and all in rags, and now you are like some god come down from
heaven."
Ulysses answered, "Telemachus, you ought not t'be s'immeasurably
astonished at my being really here. There is n'other Ulysses wh'will
come hereafter. Such as I am, it is I, wh'after long wandering and
much hardship have got home in the twentieth year t'my own country.
What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva, who
does with me whatever she will, for she can d'what she pleases. At one
moment she makes me like a beggar, and the next I am a young man with
good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods wh'live in
heaven t'make any man look either rich or poor."
As he spoke he sat down, and Telemachus threw his arms about his father
and wept. They were both s'much moved that they cried aloud like
eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their
half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep, and the
sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not
suddenly said, "In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you
t'Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves t'be—for you
cannot have come by land?"
"I will tell you the truth, my son," replied Ulysses. "It was the
Phaeacians wh'brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the
habit of giving escorts t'any one wh'reaches their coasts. They took
me over the sea while I was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after
giving me many presents in bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by
heaven's mercy are lying concealed in a cave, and I am now come here on
the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our
enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the suitors, with their
number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can then turn
the matter over in my mind, and see whether we tw'can fight the whole
body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others t'help us."
T'this Telemachus answered, "Father, I have always heard of your
renown both in the field and in council, but the task you talk of is a
very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; tw'men cannot
stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only, nor
twice ten, but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at
once. There are fifty-tw'chosen youths from Dulichium, and they have
six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans
from Zacynthus, and twelve from Ithaca itself, all of them well born.
They have with them a servant Medon, a bard, and tw'men wh'can carve
at table. If we face such numbers as this, you may have bitter cause to
rue your coming, and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some
one wh'would be willing t'come and help us."
"Listen t'me," replied Ulysses, "and think whether Minerva and her
father Jove may seem sufficient, or whether I am t'try and find some
one else as well."
"Those whom you have named," answered Telemachus, "are a couple of good
allies, for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power
over both gods and men."
"These two," continued Ulysses, "will not keep long out of the fray,
when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now, therefore, return
home early to-morrow morning, and g'about among the suitors as before.
Later on the swineherd will bring me t'the city disguised as a
miserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me, steel your heart
against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of
the house, or throw things at me, look on and d'nothing beyond gently
trying t'make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to
you, for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say, and
lay my saying t'your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind, I
will nod my head t'you, and on seeing me d'this you must collect all
the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.
Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say
that you have taken it t'be out of the way of the smoke, inasmuch as
it is n'longer what it was when Ulysses went away, but has become
soiled and begrimed with soot. Add t'this more particularly that you
are afraid Jove may set them on t'quarrel over their wine, and that
they may d'each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and
wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people t'use them. But
leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me, and a couple of
oxhide shields s'that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and
Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There is als'another
matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins, let
n'one know that Ulysses is within the house—neither Laertes, nor yet
the swineherd, nor any of the servants, nor even Penelope herself. Let
you and me exploit the women alone, and let us als'make trial of some
other of the men servants, t'see wh'is on our side and whose hand is
against us."
"Father," replied Telemachus, "you will come t'know me by and by, and
when you d'you will find that I can keep your counsel. I d'not think,
however, the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us.
Think it over. It will take us a long time t'g'the round of the farms
and exploit the men, and all the time the suitors will be wasting your
estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all
means, t'see wh'are disloyal and wh'guiltless, but I am not in
favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend t'that later
on, if you really have some sign from Jove that he will support you."
Thus did they converse, and meanwhile the ship which had brought
Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When
they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on t'the land;
their servants came and took their armour from them, and they left all
the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant t'tell
Penelope that Telemachus had gone int'the country, but had sent the
ship t'the town t'prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.
This servant and Eumaeus happened t'meet when they were both on the
same errand of going t'tell Penelope. When they reached the House, the
servant stood up and said t'the queen in the presence of the waiting
women, "Your son, Madam, is now returned from Pylos"; but Eumaeus went
close up t'Penelope, and said privately all that her son had bidden
him tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its`,length:7500,num_lines:115,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Emotional and determined",sentiment:.8,quote:"As he spoke he kissed his son, and a tear fell from his cheek on t'the ground, for he had restrained all tears till now.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Skeptical and emotional",sentiment:.5,quote:"You are not my father, but some god is flattering me with vain hopes that I may grieve the more hereafter; n'mortal man could of himself contrive t'd'as you have been doing.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Suitors Plot Against Telemachus",summary:"The suitors discuss their plans against Telemachus after his return.",chapter:"BOOK XVI",first_line:251,last_line:334,explanation:"Change of location to the suitors' assembly.",text:`outbuildings and went back t'his pigs again.
The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened, s'they went
outside the great wall that ran round the outer court, and held a
council near the main entrance. Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the
first t'speak.
"My friends," said he, "this voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious
matter; we had made sure that it would come t'nothing. Now, however,
let us draw a ship int'the water, and get a crew together t'send
after the others and tell them t'come back as fast as they can."
He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw
the ship inside the harbour, with the crew lowering her sails, and
putting by their oars; s'he laughed, and said t'the others, "We need
not send them any message, for they are here. Some god must have told
them, or else they saw the ship g'by, and could not overtake her."
On this they rose and went t'the water side. The crew then drew the
ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them, and they
went up in a body t'the place of assembly, but they would not let any
one old or young sit along with them, and Antinous, son of Eupeithes,
spoke first.
"Good heavens," said he, "see how the gods have saved this man from
destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day
long, and when the sun was down we never went on shore t'sleep, but
waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and
killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us
consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our
affair is never likely t'come off while he is alive, for he is very
shrewd, and public feeling is by n'means all on our side. We must make
haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose n'time
in doing so, for he will be furious with us, and will tell all the
world how we plotted t'kill him, but failed t'take him. The people
will not like this when they come t'know of it; we must see that they
d'us n'hurt, nor drive us from our own country int'exile. Let us try
and lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town, or on the
road hither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us, and let his
mother and the man wh'marries her have the house. If this does not
please you, and you wish Telemachus t'live on and hold his father's
property, then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this
way, but must make our offers t'Penelope each from his own house, and
she can marry the man wh'will give the most for her, and whose lot it
is t'win her."
They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose t'speak. He was the
son of Nisus, wh'was son t'king Aretias, and he was foremost among
all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of
Dulichium; his conversation, moreover, was more agreeable t'Penelope
than that of any of the other suitors, for he was a man of good natural
disposition. "My friends," said he, speaking t'them plainly and in all
honestly, "I am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous
thing t'kill one wh'is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of
the gods, and if the oracles of Jove advise it, I will both help to
kill him myself, and will urge everyone else t'd'so; but if they
dissuade us, I would have you hold your hands."
Thus did he speak, and his words pleased them well, s'they rose
forthwith and went t'the house of Ulysses, where they took their
accustomed seats.
Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself t'the suitors. She
knew of the plot against Telemachus, for the servant Medon had
overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to
the court attended by her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she
stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister
holding a veil before her face, and rebuked Antinous saying:
"Antinous, insolent and wicked schemer, they say you are the best
speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca, but you are
nothing of the kind. Madman, why should you try t'compass the death of
Telemachus, and take n'heed of suppliants, whose witness is Jove
himself? It is not right for you t'plot thus against one another. Do
you not remember how your father fled t'this house in fear of the
people, wh'were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian
pirates and plundered the Thesprotians wh'were at peace with us? They
wanted t'tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had, but Ulysses
stayed their hands although they were infuriated, and now you devour
his property without paying for it, and break my heart by wooing his
wife and trying t'kill his son. Leave off doing so, and stop the
others also."
T'this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered, "Take heart, Queen Penelope
daughter of Icarius, and d'not trouble yourself about these matters.
The man is not yet born, nor never will be, wh'shall lay hands upon
your son Telemachus, while I yet live t'look upon the face of the
earth. I say—and it shall surely be—that my spear shall be reddened
with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees, held
wine up t'my lips t'drink, and put pieces of meat int'my hands.
Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing
t'fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death comes t'him
from the gods, he cannot escape it." He said this t'quiet her, but in
reality he was plotting against Telemachus.`,length:5416,num_lines:84,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Eurymachus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Key instigator of the suitors' plot",emotion:"determined and scheming",sentiment:-.7,quote:`"This voyage of Telemachus's is a very serious matter; we had made sure that it would come t'nothing."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Amphinomus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Voice of reason among the suitors",emotion:"cautious and reasonable",sentiment:.2,quote:`"I am not in favour of killing Telemachus.

When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus
bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands, for
he wanted t'g'int'the city. "Old friend," said he t'the swineherd,
"I will now g't'the town and show myself t'my mother, for she will
never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate
stranger, take him t'the town and let him beg there of any one who
will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my
own, and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry
s'much the worse for him, but I like t'say what I mean."
Then Ulysses said, "Sir, I d'not want t'stay here; a beggar can
always d'better in town than country, for any one wh'likes can give
him something. I am to'old t'care about remaining here at the beck
and call of a master. Therefore let this man d'as you have just told
him, and take me t'the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,
and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly
thin, and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold, for you
say the city is some way off."
On this Telemachus strode off through the yards, brooding his revenge
upon the suitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a
bearing-post of the cloister, crossed the stone floor of the cloister
itself, and went inside.
Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting
the fleeces on t'the seats, and she burst out crying as she ran up to
him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and
shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like
Diana or Venus, and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She
kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes, "Light of my eyes,"
she cried as she spoke fondly t'him, "s'you are come home again; I
made sure I was never going t'see you any more. T'think of your
having gone off t'Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining
my consent. But come, tell me what you saw."
"D'not scold me, mother," answered Telemachus, "nor vex me, seeing
what a narrow escape I have had, but wash your face, change your dress,
g'upstairs with your maids, and promise full and sufficient hecatombs
t'all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the
suitors. I must now g't'the place of assembly t'invite a stranger
wh'has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew, and
told Piraeus t'take him home and look after him till I could come for
him myself."
She heeded her son's words, washed her face, changed her dress, and
vowed full and sufficient hecatombs t'all the gods if they would only
vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.`,length:2924,num_lines:46,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"He is central to the scene's action.",emotion:"Determined and conflicted",sentiment:.5,quote:"I have trouble enough of my own, and cannot be burdened with other people.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Odysseus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"His presence drives the plot forward.",emotion:"Resigned and pragmatic",sentiment:.3,quote:"I d'not want t'stay here; a beggar can always d'better in town than country.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Penelope",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Her emotional response is pivotal to the scene.",emotion:"Joyful yet anxious",sentiment:.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Penelope feels joyful yet anxious upon Odysseus's return, fearing she might never see him again.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Euryclea",importance:.5,importance_exp:"She adds emotional depth but is not central to the plot.",emotion:"Joyful",sentiment:.6,quote:"she burst out crying as she ran up to him; all the other maids came up too, and covered his head and shoulders with their kisses.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Telemachus and Eumaeus",summary:"Telemachus discusses plans with Eumaeus before heading to the town.",chapter:"BOOK XVII",first_line:47,last_line:66,explanation:"Location changes to the cloisters.",text:`Telemachus went through, and out of, the cloisters spear in hand—not
alone, for his tw'fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a
presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went
by, and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths
and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them, and went t'sit with
Mentor, Antiphus, and Halitherses, old friends of his father's house,
and they made him tell them all that had happened t'him. Then Piraeus
came up with Theoclymenus, whom he had escorted through the town t'the
place of assembly, whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was
first t'speak: "Telemachus," said he, "I wish you would send some of
your women t'my house t'take away the presents Menelaus gave you."
"We d'not know, Piraeus," answered Telemachus, "what may happen. If
the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,
I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people
should get hold of them. If on the other hand I managed t'kill them, I
shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents."

A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden
ewer, and poured it int'a silver basin for them t'wash their hands;
and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them
bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.
Opposite them sat Penelope, reclining on a couch by one of the
bearing-posts of the cloister, and spinning. Then they laid their hands
on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had
enough t'eat and drink Penelope said:
"Telemachus, I shall g'upstairs and lie down on that sad couch, which
I have not ceased t'water with my tears, from the day Ulysses set out
for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed, however, t'make it clear
t'me before the suitors came back t'the house, whether or n'you had
been able t'hear anything about the return of your father."
"I will tell you then truth," replied her son. "We went t'Pylos and
saw Nestor, wh'took me t'his house and treated me as hospitably as
though I were a son of his own wh'had just returned after a long
absence; s'als'did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from
any human being about Ulysses, whether he was alive or dead. He sent
me, therefore, with a chariot and horses t'Menelaus. There I saw
Helen, for whose sake s'many, both Argives and Trojans, were in
heaven's wisdom doomed t'suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that
had brought me t'Lacedaemon, and I told him the whole truth, whereon
he said, 'So, then, these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind
might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion, and then go
off t'feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion, when he
comes back t'his lair, will make short work with the pair of them, and
s'will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and
Apollo, if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with
Philomeleides in Lesbos, and threw him s'heavily that all the Greeks
cheered him—if he is still such, and were t'come near these suitors,
they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your
question, however, I will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but what the
old man of the sea told me, s'much will I tell you in full. He said he
could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the
nymph Calypso, wh'was keeping him prisoner, and he could not reach his
home, for he had n'ships nor sailors t'take him over the sea.' This
was what Menelaus told me, and when I had heard his story I came away;
the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again."
With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said
t'her:

that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca, and, either going about the
country or staying in one place, is enquiring int'all these evil deeds
and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I
was on the ship which meant this, and I told Telemachus about it."
"May it be even so," answered Penelope; "if your words come true, you
shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all wh'see you
shall congratulate you."
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs, or
aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the
house, and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now
time for dinner, and the flock of sheep and goats had come int'the
town from all the country round, 140 with their shepherds as usual,
then Medon, wh'was their favourite servant, and wh'waited upon them
at table, said, "Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport,
s'come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing,
at dinner time."
They left their sports as he told them, and when they were within the
house, they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside, and then
sacrificed some sheep, goats, pigs, and a heifer, all of them fat and
well grown.141 Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime
Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town, and the
swineherd said, "Stranger, I suppose you still want t'g't'town
to-day, as my master said you were t'do; for my own part I should have
liked you t'stay here as a station hand, but I must d'as my master
tells me, or he will scold me later on, and a scolding from one's
master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off, for it is now broad
day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it
colder."142
"I know, and understand you," replied Ulysses; "you need say n'more.
Let us be going, but if you have a stick ready cut, let me have it to
walk with, for you say the road is a very rough one."
As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,
by the cord from which it hung, and Eumaeus gave him a stick t'his
liking. The tw'then started, leaving the station in charge of the dogs
and herdsmen wh'remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his
master followed after, looking like some broken down old tramp as he`,length:2455,num_lines:38,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Determined and hopeful",sentiment:.7,quote:"I know, and understand you.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Penelope",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Significant role in the conversation",emotion:"Hopeful yet anxious",sentiment:.6,quote:"May it be even so,",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important supporting character",emotion:"Obedient and respectful",sentiment:.5,quote:"Let us then be off, for it is now broad day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it colder.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Medon",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Minor but relevant character",emotion:"Practical and dutiful",sentiment:.4,quote:"Now then, my young masters, you have had enough sport, s'come inside that we may get dinner ready.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:4,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Ulysses Meets Melanthius",summary:"Ulysses encounters Melanthius, who insults him.",chapter:"BOOK XVII",first_line:147,last_line:194,explanation:"Location changes to the fountain.",text:`leaned upon his staff, and his clothes were all in rags. When they had
got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached
the fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been
made by Ithacus, Neritus, and Polyctor. There was a grove of
water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it, and the clear
cold water came down t'it from a rock high up,143 while above the
fountain there was an altar t'the nymphs, at which all wayfarers used
t'sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was
driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors'
dinner, and there were tw'shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus and
Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language, which
made Ulysses very angry.
"There you go," cried he, "and a precious pair you are. See how heaven
brings birds of the same feather t'one another. Where, pray, master
swineherd, are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any
one sick t'see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won
a prize for anything in his life, but will g'about rubbing his
shoulders against every man's door post, and begging, not for swords
and cauldrons144 like a man, but only for a few scraps not worth
begging for. If you would give him t'me for a hand on my station, he
might d't'clean out the folds, or bring a bit of sweet feed t'the
kids, and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but
he has taken t'bad ways and will not g'about any kind of work; he
will d'nothing but beg victuals all the town over, t'feed his
insatiable belly. I say, therefore—and it shall surely be—if he goes
near Ulysses' house he will get his head broken by the stools they will
fling at him, till they turn him out."
On this, as he passed, he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure
wantonness, but Ulysses stood firm, and did not budge from the path.
For a moment he doubted whether or n't'fly at Melanthius and kill him
with his staff, or fling him t'the ground and beat his brains out; he
resolved, however, t'endure it and keep himself in check, but the
swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him, lifting up his
hands and praying t'heaven as he did so.
"Fountain nymphs," he cried, "children of Jove, if ever Ulysses burned
you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids, grant my
prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end t'the
swaggering threats with which such men as you g'about insulting
people—gadding all over the town while your flocks are going t'ruin
through bad shepherding."
Then Melanthius the goatherd answered, "You ill conditioned cur, what
are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship
and take you t'a foreign country, where I can sell you and pocket the
money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apoll'would strike
Telemachus dead this very day, or that the suitors would kill him, as I
am that Ulysses will never come home again."
With this he left them t'come on at their leisure, while he went
quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master.

Eurymachus, wh'liked him better than any of the others. The servants
brought him a portion of meat, and an upper woman servant set bread
before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came
up t'the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music, for Phemius was
just beginning t'sing t'the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the
swineherd's hand, and said:
"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. N'matter how far
you go, you will find few like it. One building keeps following on
after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round
it; the doors are double folding, and of good workmanship; it would be
a hard matter t'take it by force of arms. I perceive, too, that there
are many people banqueting within it, for there is a smell of roast
meat, and I hear a sound of music, which the gods have made t'g'along
with feasting."
Then Eumaeus said, "You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally
do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you g'inside
first and join the suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you
wait here and let me g'in first? But d'not wait long, or some one may
see you loitering about outside, and throw something at you. Consider
this matter I pray you."
And Ulysses answered, "I understand and heed. G'in first and leave me
here where I am. I am quite used t'being beaten and having things
thrown at me. I have been s'much buffeted about in war and by sea that
I am case-hardened, and this to'may g'with the rest. But a man cannot
hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives
much trouble t'all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted
out t'sail the seas, and t'make war upon other people."
As they were thus talking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his
head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Ulysses had bred
before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any work out of him.
In the old days he used t'be taken out by the young men when they went
hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone
he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in
front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to
manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw
Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he
could not get close up t'his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the
other side of the yard, he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus
seeing it, and said:
"Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:
his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he
only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept
merely for show?"
"This hound," answered Eumaeus, "belonged t'him wh'has died in a far
country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy, he would
soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the
forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But
now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and
the women take n'care of him. Servants never d'their work when their
master's hand is n'longer over them, for Jove takes half the goodness
out of a man when he makes a slave of him."
As he spoke he went inside the buildings t'the cloister where the
suitors were, but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.
Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did, and beckoned him
t'come and sit beside him; s'he looked about and saw a seat lying
near where the carver sat serving out their portions t'the suitors; he
picked it up, brought it t'Telemachus's table, and sat down opposite
him. Then the servant brought him his portion, and gave him bread from
the bread-basket.
Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside, looking like a poor
miserable old beggar, leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in
rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors
leading from the outer t'the inner court, and against a bearing-post
of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed, and had made
t'join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the
bread-basket, with as much meat as he could hold in his tw'hands, and
said t'Eumaeus, "Take this t'the stranger, and tell him t'g'the
round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be
shamefaced."
S'Eumaeus went up t'him and said, "Stranger, Telemachus sends you
this, and says you are t'g'the round of the suitors begging, for
beggars must not be shamefaced."
Ulysses answered, "May King Jove grant all happiness t'Telemachus, and
fulfil the desire of his heart."
Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him, and laid it
on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the
bard was singing, and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The
suitors applauded the bard, whereon Minerva went up t'Ulysses and
prompted him t'beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors, that
he might see what kind of people they were, and tell the good from the
bad; but come what might she was not going t'save a single one of
them. Ulysses, therefore, went on his round, going from left t'right,
and stretched out his hands t'beg as though he were a real beggar.`,length:5344,num_lines:84,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central character in the scene",emotion:"Determined and reflective",sentiment:.5,quote:"Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Key ally of Ulysses",emotion:"Concerned and loyal",sentiment:.6,quote:"You have perceived aright, as indeed you generally do; but let us think what will be our best course.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Argos",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Symbol of Ulysses' past",emotion:"Sad and neglected",sentiment:-.5,quote:"As soon as he saw Ulysses standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up t'his master.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Supportive of Ulysses",emotion:"Generous and caring",sentiment:.7,quote:"Take this t'the stranger, and tell him t'g'the round of the suitors, and beg from them; a beggar must not be shamefaced.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:6,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Penelope's Concern",summary:"Penelope expresses her concerns about the suitors and the beggar.",chapter:"BOOK XVII",first_line:279,last_line:422,explanation:"Location changes to Penelope's room.",text:`Some of them pitied him, and were curious about him, asking one another
wh'he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius
said, "Suitors of my noble mistress, I can tell you something about
him, for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here, but I
know nothing about the man himself, nor where he comes from."
On this Antinous began t'abuse the swineherd. "You precious idiot," he
cried, "what have you brought this man t'town for? Have we not tramps
and beggars enough already t'pester us as we sit at meat? D'you think
it a small thing that such people gather here t'waste your master's
property—and must you needs bring this man as well?"
And Eumaeus answered, "Antinous, your birth is good but your words
evil. It was n'doing of mine that he came here. Wh'is likely to
invite a stranger from a foreign country, unless it be one of those who
can d'public service as a seer, a healer of hurts, a carpenter, or a
bard wh'can charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the
world over, but n'one is likely t'ask a beggar wh'will only worry
him. You are always harder on Ulysses' servants than any of the other
suitors are, and above all on me, but I d'not care s'long as
Telemachus and Penelope are alive and here."
But Telemachus said, "Hush, d'not answer him; Antinous has the
bitterest tongue of all the suitors, and he makes the others worse."
Then turning t'Antinous he said, "Antinous, you take as much care of
my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want t'see this
stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and
give it him yourself; I d'not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind
my mother, nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you
will not d'what I say, for you are more fond of eating things yourself
than of giving them t'other people."
"What d'you mean, Telemachus," replied Antinous, "by this swaggering
talk? If all the suitors were t'give him as much as I will, he would
not come here again for another three months."
As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from
under the table, and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses, but
the other suitors all gave him something, and filled his wallet with
bread and meat; he was about, therefore, t'g'back t'the threshold
and eat what the suitors had given him, but he first went up to
Antinous and said:
"Sir, give me something; you are not, surely, the poorest man here; you
seem t'be a chief, foremost among them all; therefore you should be
the better giver, and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too
was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I
gave t'many a tramp such as I now am, n'matter wh'he might be nor
what he wanted. I had any number of servants, and all the other things
which people have wh'live well and are accounted wealthy, but it
pleased Jove t'take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving
robbers t'Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I
stationed my ships in the river Aegyptus, and bade my men stay by them
and keep guard over them, while I sent out scouts t'reconnoitre from
every point of vantage.
"But the men disobeyed my orders, took t'their own devices, and
ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their
wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried t'the city,
and when they heard the war-cry, the people came out at daybreak till
the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot, and with the gleam
of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would no
longer face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The
Egyptians killed many of us, and took the rest alive t'd'forced
labour for them; as for myself, they gave me t'a friend wh'met them,
t'take t'Cyprus, Dmetor by name, son of Iasus, wh'was a great man in
Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery."
Then Antinous said, "What god can have sent such a pestilence t'plague
us during our dinner? Get out, int'the open part of the court,145 or I
will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and
importunity; you have begged of all the others, and they have given you
lavishly, for they have abundance round them, and it is easy t'be free
with other people's property when there is plenty of it."
On this Ulysses began t'move off, and said, "Your looks, my fine sir,
are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would
not spare a poor man s'much as a pinch of salt, for though you are in
another man's, and surrounded with abundance, you cannot find it in you
t'give him even a piece of bread."
This made Antinous very angry, and he scowled at him saying, "You shall
pay for this before you get clear of the court." With these words he
threw a footstool at him, and hit him on the right shoulder blade near
the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not
even stagger him, but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his
revenge. Then he went back t'the threshold and sat down there, laying
his well filled wallet at his feet.
"Listen t'me," he cried, "you suitors of Queen Penelope, that I may
speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets
hit while fighting for his money, or for his sheep or his cattle; and
even s'Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,
which is always getting people int'trouble. Still, if the poor have
gods and avenging deities at all, I pray them that Antinous may come to
a bad end before his marriage."
"Sit where you are, and eat your victuals in silence, or be off
elsewhere," shouted Antinous. "If you say more I will have you dragged
hand and foot through the courts, and the servants shall flay you
alive."
The other suitors were much displeased at this, and one of the young
men said, "Antinous, you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a
tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out t'be some
god—and we know the gods g'about disguised in all sorts of ways as
people from foreign countries, and travel about the world t'see wh'do
amiss and wh'righteously."146
Thus said the suitors, but Antinous paid them n'heed. Meanwhile
Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given t'his
father, and though n'tear fell from him, he shook his head in silence
and brooded on his revenge.
Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the
banqueting-cloister, she said before her maids, "Would that Apollo
would s'strike you, Antinous," and her waiting woman Eurynome
answered, "If our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would
ever again see the sun rise." Then Penelope said, "Nurse,147 I hate
every single one of them, for they mean nothing but mischief, but I
hate Antinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate
tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else
has given him something t'put in his wallet, but Antinous has hit him
on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool."
Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room, and in the
meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the
swineherd and said, "Eumaeus, g'and tell the stranger t'come here, I
want t'see him and ask him some questions. He seems t'have travelled
much, and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "If these Achaeans, Madam,
would only keep quiet, you would be charmed with the history of his
adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,
which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,
and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had
been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world, on whose lips
all hearers hang entranced, I could not have been more charmed as I sat
in my hut and listened t'him. He says there is an old friendship
between his house and that of Ulysses, and that he comes from Crete
where the descendants of Minos live, after having been driven hither
and thither by every kind of misfortune; he als'declares that he has
heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the
Thesprotians, and that he is bringing great wealth home with him."
"Call him here, then," said Penelope, "that I to'may hear his story.
As for the suitors, let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they
will, for they have nothing t'fret about. Their corn and wine remain
unwasted in their houses with none but servants t'consume them, while
they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,
sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving s'much as a
thought t'the quantity of wine they drink. N'estate can stand such
recklessness, for we have now n'Ulysses t'protect us. If he were to
come again, he and his son would soon have their revenge."
As she spoke Telemachus sneezed s'loudly that the whole house
resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this, and said to
Eumaeus, "G'and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed
just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are
going t'be killed, and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore

stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you;
she is in great grief, but she wishes t'hear anything you can tell her
about her husband, and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the
truth, she will give you a shirt and cloak, which are the very things
that you are most in want of. As for bread, you can get enough of that
t'fill your belly, by begging about the town, and letting those give
that will."
"I will tell Penelope," answered Ulysses, "nothing but what is strictly
true. I know all about her husband, and have been partner with him in
affliction, but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel
suitors, for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now,
moreover, as I was going about the house without doing any harm, a man
gave me a blow that hurt me very much, but neither Telemachus nor any
one else defended me. Tell Penelope, therefore, t'be patient and wait
till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up t'the fire, for my
clothes are worn very thin—you know they are, for you have seen them
ever since I first asked you t'help me—she can then ask me about the
return of her husband."
The swineherd went back when he heard this, and Penelope said as she
saw him cross the threshold, "Why d'you not bring him here, Eumaeus?
Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming
inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced."
T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "The stranger is quite
reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one
else would do. He asks you t'wait till sundown, and it will be much
better, madam, that you should have him all t'yourself, when you can
hear him and talk t'him as you will."
"The man is n'fool," answered Penelope, "it would very likely be as he
says, for there are n'such abominable people in the whole world as
these men are."
When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back t'the suitors, for he had
explained everything. Then he went up t'Telemachus and said in his ear
s'that none could overhear him, "My dear sir, I will now g'back to
the pigs, t'see after your property and my own business. You will look
t'what is going on here, but above all be careful t'keep out of
danger, for there are many wh'bear you ill will. May Jove bring them
t'a bad end before they d'us a mischief."
"Very well," replied Telemachus, "g'home when you have had your
dinner, and in the morning come here with the victims we are to
sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest t'heaven and me."
On this Eumaeus took his seat again, and when he had finished his
dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table, and
went back t'his pigs. As for the suitors, they presently began to
amuse themselves with singing and dancing, for it was now getting on
towards evening.`,length:2871,num_lines:46,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Key messenger and supporter of Ulysses",emotion:"Concerned and loyal",sentiment:.5,quote:`"Father stranger, my mistress Penelope, mother of Telemachus, has sent for you; she is in great grief, but she wishes t'hear anything you can tell her about her husband..."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Odysseus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Protagonist seeking to reunite with Penelope",emotion:"Cautious and determined",sentiment:.4,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Odysseus is determined to be truthful with Penelope, showing his cautious nature in a delicate situation.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Penelope",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Grieving wife seeking news of Ulysses",emotion:"Anxious and hopeful",sentiment:.3,quote:`"Why d'you not bring him here, Eumaeus?

the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and
drunkard. This man had n'strength nor stay in him, but he was a great
hulking fellow t'look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him,
was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,148 because
he used t'run errands for any one wh'would send him. As soon as he
came he began t'insult Ulysses, and t'try and drive him out of his
own house.
"Be off, old man," he cried, "from the doorway, or you shall be dragged
out neck and heels. D'you not see that they are all giving me the
wink, and wanting me t'turn you out by force, only I d'not like t'do
so? Get up then, and g'of yourself, or we shall come t'blows."
Ulysses frowned on him and said, "My friend, I d'you n'manner of
harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room
enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me
things that are not yours t'give. You seem t'be just such another
tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and
by. D'not, however, talk to'much about fighting or you will incense
me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood.
I shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come t'the
house of Ulysses any more."
Irus was very angry and answered, "You filthy glutton, you run on
trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind t'lay both hands
about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like s'many boar's
tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and
look on. You will never be able t'fight one wh'is s'much younger
than yourself."
Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front
of the doorway,149 and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed
heartily and said t'the others, "This is the finest sport that you
ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it int'this house. The
stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going t'fight, let us set
them on t'd's'at once."
The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the tw'ragged
tramps. "Listen t'me," said Antinous, "there are some goats' paunches
down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set
aside for supper; he wh'is victorious and proves himself t'be the
better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our
table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all."
The others all agreed, but Ulysses, t'throw them off the scent, said,
"Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his
own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though
I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,
however that none of you will give me a foul blow t'favour Irus and
secure him the victory."
They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath
Telemachus put in a word and said, "Stranger, if you have a mind to
settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.
Whoever strikes you will have t'fight more than one. I am host, and
the other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of
understanding, are of the same mind as I am."
Every one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,
thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his
mighty arms; but Minerva came up t'him and made his limbs even
stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one
would turn towards his neighbour saying, "The stranger has brought such
a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of
Irus."
Irus began t'be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded
him by force, and brought him [int'the open part of the court] in such
a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and
said, "You swaggering bully, you ought never t'have been born at all
if you are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.
I say, therefore—and it shall surely be—if he beats you and proves
himself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship t'the
mainland and send you t'king Echetus, wh'kills every one that comes
near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your
entrails for the dogs t'eat."
This frightened Irus still more, but they brought him int'the middle
of the court, and the tw'men raised their hands t'fight. Then Ulysses
considered whether he should let drive s'hard at him as t'make an end
of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow
that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best t'give
the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin t'suspect wh'he
was. Then they began t'fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right
shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that
broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his
mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on
the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of
laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him
int'the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up
against the wall and put his staff in his hands. "Sit here," said he,
"and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you
try t'make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still
worse."
Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his
shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back t'sit down upon
the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and`,length:5611,num_lines:88,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.9,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Determined and confident",sentiment:.8,quote:"You seem t'be just such another tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and by.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Irus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important as the antagonist in the scene",emotion:"Angry and fearful",sentiment:-.5,quote:"You filthy glutton, you run on trippingly like an old fish-fag.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Antinous",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Important as a catalyst for the conflict",emotion:"Amused and mocking",sentiment:.5,quote:"This is the finest sport that you ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it int'this house.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Moderately important as a supporter of Ulysses",emotion:"Supportive and encouraging",sentiment:.7,quote:"Stranger, if you have a mind to settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:1,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Penelope's Decision",summary:"Penelope decides to show herself to the suitors.",chapter:"BOOK XVIII",first_line:127,last_line:146,explanation:"Location changes to Penelope's room.",text:`Then Minerva put it int'the mind of Penelope t'show herself t'the

still further honour from her son and husband. S'she feigned a mocking
laugh and said, "Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to
show myself t'the suitors although I detest them. I should like also
t'give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more t'do

"My dear child," answered Eurynome, "all that you have said is true, go

not right that you should grieve s'incessantly; for Telemachus, whom

With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but
attended by tw'of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she
stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,
holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either
side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were s'overpowered and
became s'desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might
win her for his own bed fellow.

Telemachus, "I understand all about it and know when things are not as
they should be, which I could not d'when I was younger; I cannot,
however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then
another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,
and I have n'one t'stand by me. After all, however, this fight
between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it
t'do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,
Minerva, and Apoll'would break the neck of every one of these wooers
of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all
be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See
how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing
that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back t'his home, wherever
that may be, for he has n'strength left in him."
Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, "Queen
Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos
could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your
house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the
whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of
understanding."
T'this Penelope replied, "Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my
beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and
my dear husband with them. If he were t'return and look after my
affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence to
the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions
which heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,
and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand—'Wife,'
he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the
Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent als'at
fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner
than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to
you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do
you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at
present, and even more s'during my absence, but when you see our son
growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave this your present
home.' This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will
come when I shall have t'yield myself t'a marriage which I detest,
for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief,
moreover, cuts me t'the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me
after the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman wh'they
think will be a good wife t'them and wh'is of noble birth, and when
they are each trying t'win her for himself, they usually bring oxen
and sheep t'feast the friends of the lady, and they make her
magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's property
without paying for it."
This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying
t'get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words
which he knew she did not mean.
Then Antinous said, "Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many
presents as you please from any one wh'will give them t'you; it is
not well t'refuse a present; but we will not g'about our business nor
stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us
whoever he may be."
The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his
servant t'bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large and
lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully
made brooch pins of pure gold with which t'fasten it. Eurymachus
immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads
that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's tw'men returned with some
earrings fashioned int'three brilliant pendants which glistened most
beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of
the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful
present of some kind.
Then the queen went back t'her room upstairs, and her maids brought
the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took t'singing and
dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it
grew dark; they then brought in three braziers151 t'give light, and
piled them up with chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit
torches from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then
Ulysses said:
"Maids, servants of Ulysses wh'has s'long been absent, g't'the
queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick
wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till
morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal."
The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho
began t'gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter t'Dolius, but
had been brought up by Penelope, wh'used t'give her toys t'play
with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all
this she showed n'consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and
used t'misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.
"Poor wretch," said she, "are you gone clean out of your mind? G'and
sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering
here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters—so
many of them too? Has the wine been getting int'your head, or d'you
always babble in this way? You seem t'have lost your wits because you
beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come
and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the
house."
"Vixen," replied Ulysses, scowling at her, "I will g'and tell
Telemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb
from limb."
With these words he scared the women, and they went off int'the body
of the house. They trembled all over, for they thought he would d'as
he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding
up torches and looking at the people—brooding the while on things that
should surely come t'pass.
But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their
insolence, for she wanted Ulysses t'become even more bitter against
them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on t'gibe at him,
which made the others laugh. "Listen t'me," said he, "you suitors of
Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for
nothing that this man has come t'the house of Ulysses; I believe the
light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head—for
his hair is all gone, every bit of it."
Then turning t'Ulysses he said, "Stranger, will you work as a servant,
if I send you t'the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you
build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year
round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not
you; for you have got int'bad ways, and d'not want t'work; you had
rather fill your belly by going round the country begging."
"Eurymachus," answered Ulysses, "if you and I were t'work one against
the other in early summer when the days are at their longest—give me a
good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will last
the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing
grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a
yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance:
turn me int'a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the
straighter furrow. If, again, war were t'break out this day, give me a
shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my
temples—you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your
gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a
great man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If
Ulysses comes t'his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but
you will find them narrow when you try t'fly through them."
Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, "You
wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring t'say such things t'me,
and in public too. Has the wine been getting int'your head or d'you
always babble in this way? You seem t'have lost your wits because you
beat the tramp Irus." With this he caught hold of a footstool, but
Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for
he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and
knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his
wine-jug fell ringing t'the ground. The suitors in the covered
cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his
neighbour, saying, "I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad
luck t'him, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such
disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are t'prevail we
shall have n'more pleasure at our banquet."
On this Telemachus came forward and said, "Sirs, are you mad? Can you
not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has
possessed you. I d'not wish t'drive any of you away, but you have had
your suppers, and the sooner you all g'home t'bed the better."
The suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;
but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, wh'was son t'Aretias, said, "D'not
let us take offence; it is reasonable, s'let us make n'answer.
Neither let us d'violence t'the stranger nor t'any of Ulysses'
servants. Let the cupbearer g'round with the drink-offerings, that we
may make them and g'home t'our rest. As for the stranger, let us
leave Telemachus t'deal with him, for it is t'his house that he has
come."
Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, s'Mulius of
Dulichium, servant t'Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water
and handed it round t'each of them man by man, whereon they made their`,length:9851,num_lines:153,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Telemachus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Telemachus is defending his home.",emotion:"Frustrated and defiant",sentiment:.1,quote:"I wish Father Jove, Minerva, and Apoll'would break the neck of every one of these wooers of yours...",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Penelope",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Penelope expresses her sorrow and defiance.",emotion:"Sorrowful and defiant",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Eurymachus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Eurymachus is antagonizing Ulysses.",emotion:"Arrogant and mocking",sentiment:-.6,quote:"You wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring t'say such things t'me, and in public too.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4},{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Ulysses is the central character in conflict with the suitors.",emotion:"Defiant and calculating",sentiment:.2,quote:"If Ulysses comes t'his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but you will find them narrow when you try t'fly through them.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Antinous",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Antinous is leading the suitors' actions.",emotion:"Dismissive and commanding",sentiment:-.4,quote:"Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many presents as you please from any one wh'will give them t'you; it is not well t'refuse a present; but we will not g'about our business nor stir from where we are...",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:5},{name:"Melantho",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Melantho mocks Ulysses, showing her disdain.",emotion:"Contemptuous",sentiment:-.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Melantho's contempt for the beggar highlights her disdain for those she considers inferior.",importance_rank:6},{name:"Amphinomus",importance:.4,importance_exp:"Amphinomus tries to calm the situation.",emotion:"Pragmatic",sentiment:0,quote:"D'not let us take offence; it is reasonable, s'let us make n'answer.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:7}],number:4,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Ulysses and Telemachus Plan",summary:"Ulysses instructs Telemachus to remove the armor.",chapter:"BOOK XIX",first_line:1,last_line:40,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`TELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR—ULYSSES INTERVIEWS

Minerva's help he might be able t'kill the suitors. Presently he said
t'Telemachus, "Telemachus, we must get the armour together and take it
down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have

smoke, inasmuch as it is n'longer what it was when Ulysses went away,
but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add t'this more
particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on t'quarrel over
their wine, and that they may d'each other some harm which may
disgrace both banquet and wooing, for the sight of arms sometimes
tempts people t'use them."
Telemachus approved of what his father had said, s'he called nurse
Euryclea and said, "Nurse, shut the women up in their room, while I
take the armour that my father left behind him down int'the store
room. N'one looks after it now my father is gone, and it has got all
smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want t'take it down where
the smoke cannot reach it."
"I wish, child," answered Euryclea, "that you would take the management
of the house int'your own hands altogether, and look after all the
property yourself. But wh'is t'g'with you and light you t'the
store-room? The maids would have done so, but you would not let them."
"The stranger," said Telemachus, "shall show me a light; when people
eat my bread they must earn it, n'matter where they come from."
Euryclea did as she was told, and bolted the women inside their room.
Then Ulysses and his son made all haste t'take the helmets, shields,
and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her
hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance, whereon Telemachus said,
"Father, my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls, with the rafters,
crossbeams, and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a
flaming fire. Surely there is some god here wh'has come down from
heaven."
"Hush," answered Ulysses, "hold your peace and ask n'questions, for
this is the manner of the gods. Get you t'your bed, and leave me here
t'talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will
ask me all sorts of questions."
On this Telemachus went by torch-light t'the other side of the inner
court, t'the room in which he always slept.

means whereby with Minerva's help he might be able t'kill the suitors.
Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana, and
they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the
fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a
footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered
with a thick fleece: on this she now sat, and the maids came from the
women's room t'join her. They set about removing the tables at which
the wicked suitors had been dining, and took away the bread that was
left, with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers
out of the braziers, and heaped much wood upon them t'give both light
and heat; but Melanth'began t'rail at Ulysses a second time and said,
"Stranger, d'you mean t'plague us by hanging about the house all
night and spying upon the women? Be off, you wretch, outside, and eat
your supper there, or you shall be driven out with a firebrand."
Ulysses scowled at her and answered, "My good woman, why should you be
s'angry with me? Is it because I am not clean, and my clothes are all
in rags, and because I am obliged t'g'begging about after the manner
of tramps and beggars generally? I to'was a rich man once, and had a
fine house of my own; in those days I gave t'many a tramp such as I
now am, n'matter wh'he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number
of servants, and all the other things which people have wh'live well
and are accounted wealthy, but it pleased Jove t'take all away from
me; therefore, woman, beware lest you to'come t'lose that pride and
place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you
get out of favour with your mistress, and lest Ulysses should come
home, for there is still a chance that he may d'so. Moreover, though
he be dead as you think he is, yet by Apollo's will he has left a son
behind him, Telemachus, wh'will note anything done amiss by the maids
in the house, for he is now n'longer in his boyhood."
Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid, "Impudent
baggage," said she, "I see how abominably you are behaving, and you
shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well, for I told you myself,
that I was going t'see the stranger and ask him about my husband, for
whose sake I am in such continual sorrow."
Then she said t'her head waiting woman Eurynome, "Bring a seat with a
fleece upon it, for the stranger t'sit upon while he tells his story,
and listens t'what I have t'say. I wish t'ask him some questions."
Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it, and as soon
as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying, "Stranger, I shall`,length:2721,num_lines:40,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Determined and reflective",sentiment:.5,quote:"I to'was a rich man once, and had a fine house of my own; in those days I gave t'many a tramp such as I now am, n'matter wh'he might be nor what he wanted.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Penelope",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Sorrowful and assertive",sentiment:.4,quote:"I see how abominably you are behaving, and you shall smart for it.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Melanthius",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Somewhat important character in this scene",emotion:"Hostile and contemptuous",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Stranger, d'you mean t'plague us by hanging about the house all night and spying upon the women?",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Ulysses Reveals His Identity",summary:"Ulysses speaks to Penelope about his past and their shared history.",chapter:"BOOK XIX",first_line:81,last_line:130,explanation:"Location changes to Ulysses recounting his story.",text:`first ask you wh'and whence are you? Tell me of your town and
parents."
"Madam," answered Ulysses, "wh'on the face of the whole earth can dare
t'chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself;
you are like some blameless king, wh'upholds righteousness, as the
monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and
barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, the ewes bring forth lambs,
and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues, and his people
d'good deeds under him. Nevertheless, as I sit here in your house, ask
me some other question and d'not seek t'know my race and family, or
you will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am
full of heaviness, but I ought not t'sit weeping and wailing in
another person's house, nor is it well t'be thus grieving continually.
I shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me,
and saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine."
Then Penelope answered, "Stranger, heaven robbed me of all beauty,
whether of face or figure, when the Argives set sail for Troy and my
dear husband with them. If he were t'return and look after my affairs
I should be both more respected and should show a better presence to
the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions
which heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me. The chiefs from all our
islands—Dulichium, Same, and Zacynthus, as als'from Ithaca itself, are
wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore
show n'attention t'strangers, nor suppliants, nor t'people wh'say
that they are skilled artisans, but am all the time broken-hearted
about Ulysses. They want me t'marry again at once, and I have to
invent stratagems in order t'deceive them. In the first place heaven
put it in my mind t'set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to
begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to
them, 'Sweethearts, Ulysses is indeed dead, still, d'not press me to
marry again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in
needlework perish unrecorded—till I have finished making a pall for the
her'Laertes, t'be ready against the time when death shall take him.
He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out
without a pall.' This was what I said, and they assented; whereon I
used t'keep working at my great web all day long, but at night I would
unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for
three years without their finding it out, but as time wore on and I was
now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days had been
accomplished, those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to
the suitors, wh'broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry
with me, s'I was forced t'finish my work whether I would or no. And
now I d'not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of
this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me, and my
son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate, for
he is now old enough t'understand all about it and is perfectly able
t'look after his own affairs, for heaven has blessed him with an
excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this, tell me wh'you
are and where you come from—for you must have had father and mother of
some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock."`,length:3376,num_lines:50,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Sorrowful and heavy-hearted",sentiment:-.7,quote:"I am full of heaviness, but I ought not t'sit weeping and wailing in another person's house, nor is it well t'be thus grieving continually.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Penelope",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Desperate and sorrowful",sentiment:-.8,quote:"I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions which heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Penelope's Dream",summary:"Penelope shares her dream with Ulysses and seeks interpretation.",chapter:"BOOK XIX",first_line:131,last_line:180,explanation:"Location changes to Penelope's dream discussion.",text:`Then Ulysses answered, "Madam, wife of Ulysses, since you persist in
asking me about my family, I will answer, n'matter what it costs me:
people must expect t'be pained when they have been exiles as long as I
have, and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as
regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and
fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and
there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different
languages which overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave
Eteocretans, Dorians of three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a
great town there, Cnossus, where Minos reigned wh'every nine years had
a conference with Jove himself.152 Minos was father t'Deucalion, whose
son I am, for Deucalion had tw'sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus
sailed for Troy, and I, wh'am the younger, am called Aethon; my
brother, however, was at once the older and the more valiant of the
two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him
hospitality, for the winds took him there as he was on his way t'Troy,
carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in
Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia, where the harbours are difficult to
enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then
raging. As soon as he got there he went int'the town and asked for
Idomeneus, claiming t'be his old and valued friend, but Idomeneus had
already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier, s'I took
him t'my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had
abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men wh'were with him with
barley meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and
oxen for them t'sacrifice t'their heart's content. They stayed with
me twelve days, for there was a gale blowing from the North s'strong
that one could hardly keep one's feet on land. I suppose some
unfriendly god had raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the
wind dropped, and they got away."
Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her, and Penelope wept
as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the
mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed
upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even so
did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband wh'was all the time
sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her, but he
kept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them s'much as
quiver, s'cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had
relieved herself by weeping, she turned t'him again and said: "Now,
stranger, I shall put you t'the test and see whether or n'you really
did entertain my husband and his men, as you say you did. Tell me,
then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was t'look at, and so
als'with his companions."
"Madam," answered Ulysses, "it is such a long time ag'that I can
hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home, and
went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.
Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened
by a gold brooch with tw'catches for the pin. On the face of this
there was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his
fore paws, and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground.

dog looking at the fawn, and strangling it, while the fawn was
struggling convulsively t'escape.153 As for the shirt that he wore
next his skin, it was s'soft that it fitted him like the skin of an
onion, and glistened in the sunlight t'the admiration of all the women
wh'beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying t'your heart, that
I d'not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home, or
whether one of his companions had given them t'him while he was on his
voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a
present of them, for he was a man of many friends and had few equals
among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful
purple mantle, double lined, with a shirt that went down t'his feet,
and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a
servant with him, a little older than himself, and I can tell you what
he was like; his shoulders were hunched,154 he was dark, and he had
thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Ulysses treated him with
greater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most
like-minded with himself."
Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable
proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found
relief in tears she said t'him, "Stranger, I was already disposed to
pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my
house. It was I wh'gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them
out of the store room and folded them up myself, and I gave him also
the gold brooch t'wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him
home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that
detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even t'mention."
Then Ulysses answered, "Madam, wife of Ulysses, d'not disfigure
yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can
hardly blame you for doing so. A woman wh'has loved her husband and
borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even
though he were a worse man than Ulysses, wh'they say was like a god.
Still, cease your tears and listen t'what I can tell you. I will hide
nothing from you, and can say with perfect truth that I have lately
heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the
Thesprotians, and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has
begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were
lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island, for Jove and the
sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the
sun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned t'a man. But Ulysses stuck
t'the keel of the ship and was drifted on t'the land of the
Phaeacians, wh'are near of kin t'the immortals, and wh'treated him
as though he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to
escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here
long ago, had he not thought better t'g'from land t'land gathering
wealth; for there is n'man living wh'is s'wily as he is; there is no
one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all
this, and he swore t'me—making drink-offerings in his house as he did
so—that the ship was by the water side and the crew found wh'would
take Ulysses t'his own country. He sent me off first, for there
happened t'be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island
of Dulichium, but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got
together, and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon t'keep
his family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to
Dodona that he might learn Jove's mind from the high oak tree, and know
whether after s'long an absence he should return t'Ithaca openly or
in secret. S'you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is
close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer;
nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath, and call Jove wh'is
the first and mightiest of all gods t'witness, as als'that hearth of
Ulysses t'which I have now come, that all I have spoken shall surely
come t'pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end
of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here."
"May it be even so," answered Penelope; "if your words come true you
shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all wh'see you
shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses
will not return, neither will you get your escort hence, for s'surely
as that Ulysses ever was, there are now n'longer any such masters in
the house as he was, t'receive honourable strangers or t'further them
on their way home. And now, you maids, wash his feet for him, and make
him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets, that he may be warm and
quiet till morning. Then, at day break wash him and anoint him again,
that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It
shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people wh'is uncivil
t'him; like it or not, he shall have n'more t'd'in this house. For
how, sir, shall you be able t'learn whether or n'I am superior to
others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding, if I let
you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a
little season; if they are hard, and deal hardly, people wish them ill
s'long as they are alive, and speak contemptuously of them when they
are dead, but he that is righteous and deals righteously, the people
tell of his praise among all lands, and many shall call him blessed."
Ulysses answered, "Madam, I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the
day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete t'g'on shipboard. I will
lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after
night have I passed in any rough sleeping place, and waited for
morning. Nor, again, d'I like having my feet washed; I shall not let
any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but, if you
have any old and respectable woman wh'has gone through as much trouble
as I have, I will allow her t'wash them."
T'this Penelope said, "My dear sir, of all the guests wh'ever yet
came t'my house there never was one wh'spoke in all things with such
admirable propriety as you do. There happens t'be in the house a most
respectable old woman—the same wh'received my poor dear husband in her
arms the night he was born, and nursed him in infancy. She is very
feeble now, but she shall wash your feet." "Come here," said she,
"Euryclea, and wash your master's age-mate; I suppose Ulysses' hands
and feet are very much the same now as his are, for trouble ages all of
us dreadfully fast."
On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began
t'weep and made lamentation saying, "My dear child, I cannot think
whatever I am t'd'with you. I am certain n'one was ever more
god-fearing than yourself, and yet Jove hates you. N'one in the whole
world ever burned him more thigh bones, nor gave him finer hecatombs
when you prayed you might come t'a green old age yourself and see your
son grow up t'take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone
from ever getting back t'your own home. I have n'doubt the women in
some foreign palace which Ulysses has got t'are gibing at him as all
these sluts here have been gibing at you. I d'not wonder at your not
choosing t'let them wash you after the manner in which they have
insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope
has said that I am t'd'so; I will wash them both for Penelope's sake
and for your own, for you have raised the most lively feelings of
compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover, which pray attend
to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before
now, but I make bold t'say that n'one ever yet came wh'was s'like
Ulysses in figure, voice, and feet as you are."
"Those wh'have seen us both," answered Ulysses, "have always said we
were wonderfully like each other, and now you have noticed it too."
Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going t'wash his`,length:8086,num_lines:120,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Hopeful yet weary",sentiment:.5,quote:"Madam, wife of Ulysses, d'not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss, though I can hardly blame you for doing so.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Penelope",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Grieving and hopeful",sentiment:.3,quote:"Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my house.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Euryclea",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important character providing care",emotion:"Compassionate and sorrowful",sentiment:.4,quote:"I will wash your feet myself gladly enough, as Penelope has said that I am t'd'so; I will wash them both for Penelope's sake and for your own.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3}],number:5,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Penelope's Doubts",summary:"Penelope expresses her doubts about Ulysses' return and her situation.",chapter:"BOOK XIX",first_line:301,last_line:440,explanation:"Location changes to Penelope's reflections.",text:`feet, and poured plenty of cold water int'it, adding hot till the bath
was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire, but ere long he turned away
from the light, for it occurred t'him that when the old woman had hold
of his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore, whereon
the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing
her master, she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by
a wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent
grandfather Autolycus—wh'was the most accomplished thief and perjurer
in the whole world—and with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had
endowed him with this gift, for he used t'burn the thigh bones of
goats and kids t'him, s'he took pleasure in his companionship. It
happened once that Autolycus had gone t'Ithaca and had found the child
of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set
the infant upon his knees and said, "Autolycus, you must find a name
for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one."
"Son-in-law and daughter," replied Autolycus, "call the child thus: I
am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and
another, both men and women; s'name the child 'Ulysses,' or the child
of anger. When he grows up and comes t'visit his mother's family on
Mt. Parnassus, where my possessions lie, I will make him a present and
will send him on his way rejoicing."
Ulysses, therefore, went t'Parnassus t'get the presents from
Autolycus, wh'with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome.
His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his
head, and both his beautiful eyes, while Autolycus desired his sons to
get dinner ready, and they did as he told them. They brought in a five
year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and divided it int'joints;
these they then cut carefully up int'smaller pieces and spitted them;
they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus
through the livelong day t'the going down of the sun they feasted, and
every man had his full share s'that all were satisfied; but when the
sun set and it came on dark, they went t'bed and enjoyed the boon of
sleep.
When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the sons of
Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting, and Ulysses went too.
They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy
upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning t'beat upon the fields,
fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus, they came t'a
mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the
beast they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolycus,
among whom was Ulysses, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear
in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick
brushwood, s'dense that the wind and rain could not get through it,
nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the ground underneath lay thick
with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men's feet, and the
hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up t'him, s'he
rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay
with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first t'raise his
spear and try t'drive it int'the brute, but the boar was to'quick
for him, and charged him sideways, ripping him above the knee with a
gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar,
Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder, and the point of the spear went
right through him, s'that he fell groaning in the dust until the life
went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the
carcass of the boar, and bound Ulysses' wound; then, after saying a
spell t'stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But
when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses, they made
him some splendid presents, and sent him back t'Ithaca with much
mutual good will. When he got back, his father and mother were rejoiced
t'see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had hurt himself to
get the scar; s'he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was
out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.
As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well
hold of it, she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg
fell int'the bath, which rang out and was overturned, s'that all the
water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea's eyes between her joy and her
grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught
Ulysses by the beard and said, "My dear child, I am sure you must be
Ulysses himself, only I did not know you till I had actually touched
and handled you."
As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as though wanting t'tell her
that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope was unable t'look
in that direction and observe what was going on, for Minerva had
diverted her attention; s'Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with
his right hand and with his left drew her close t'him, and said,
"Nurse, d'you wish t'be the ruin of me, you wh'nursed me at your own
breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to
my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to
recognise me, hold your tongue, and d'not say a word about it t'any
one else in the house, for if you d'I tell you—and it shall surely
be—that if heaven grants me t'take the lives of these suitors, I will
not spare you, though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other
women."
"My child," answered Euryclea, "what are you talking about? You know
very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my
tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say, and lay
my saying t'your heart, when heaven has delivered the suitors into
your hand, I will give you a list of the women in the house wh'have
been ill-behaved, and of those wh'are guiltless."
And Ulysses answered, "Nurse, you ought not t'speak in that way; I am
well able t'form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your
tongue and leave everything t'heaven."
As he said this Euryclea left the cloister t'fetch some more water,
for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and
anointed him with oil, Ulysses drew his seat nearer t'the fire t'warm
himself, and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking
t'him and said:
"Stranger, I should like t'speak with you briefly about another
matter. It is indeed nearly bed time—for those, at least, wh'can sleep
in spite of sorrow. As for myself, heaven has given me a life of such
unmeasurable woe, that even by day when I am attending t'my duties and
looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during the
whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us g't'bed, I lie
awake thinking, and my heart becomes a prey t'the most incessant and
cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in
the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a
plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own
child Itylus, son of king Zethus, even s'does my mind toss and turn in
its uncertainty whether I ought t'stay with my son here, and safeguard
my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my house, out of regard
t'public opinion and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is
not now time for me t'g'with the best of these suitors wh'are wooing
me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still
young, and unable t'understand, he would not hear of my leaving my
husband's house, but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to
d'so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his
property. Listen, then, t'a dream that I have had and interpret it for
me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of
a trough,155 and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great
eagle came swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into
the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he
soared off int'the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;
whereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so
piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he
came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter spoke t'me with
human voice, and told me t'leave off crying. 'Be of good courage,' he
said, 'daughter of Icarius; this is n'dream, but a vision of good omen
that shall surely come t'pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no
longer an eagle, but your own husband, wh'am come back t'you, and who
will bring these suitors t'a disgraceful end.' On this I woke, and
when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as
usual."
"This dream, Madam," replied Ulysses, "can admit but of one
interpretation, for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be
fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single
one of them will escape."
And Penelope answered, "Stranger, dreams are very curious and
unaccountable things, and they d'not by any means invariably come
true. There are tw'gates through which these unsubstantial fancies
proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory.

my saying t'your heart—the coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened
day that is t'sever me from the house of Ulysses, for I am about to
hold a tournament of axes. My husband used t'set up twelve axes in the
court, one in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is
built; he would then g'back from them and shoot an arrow through the
whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try t'd'the same thing, and

through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this house of
my lawful husband, s'goodly and s'abounding in wealth. But even so, I
doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams."
Then Ulysses answered, "Madam, wife of Ulysses, you need not defer your
tournament, for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,
handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron."
T'this Penelope said, "As long, sir, as you will sit here and talk to

permanently without sleep, and heaven has appointed us dwellers on

shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.`,length:1727,num_lines:26,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Penelope",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central character expressing her sorrow",emotion:"Sorrowful and contemplative",sentiment:-.7,quote:"I will therefore g'upstairs and recline upon that couch which I have never ceased t'flood with my tears from the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Odysseus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Significant character providing reassurance",emotion:"Reassuring and hopeful",sentiment:.5,quote:"Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow, handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:7,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Ulysses Cannot Sleep",summary:"Ulysses struggles with his thoughts about the suitors.",chapter:"BOOK XX",first_line:1,last_line:48,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`ULYSSES CANNOT SLEEP—PENELOPE'S PRAYER T'DIANA—THE TW'SIGNS FROM

Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on the
top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten,
and Eurynome156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down.
There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he
should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women wh'had been in the
habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling
and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and he
doubted whether t'get up and kill every single one of them then and
there, or t'let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors.
His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and
shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, s'did his heart growl with
anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast
and said, "Heart, be still, you had worse than this t'bear on the day
when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in
silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made
sure of being killed."
Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it int'endurance, but he
tossed about as one wh'turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that
he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even s'did he turn himself
about from side t'side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he
was, he should contrive t'kill s'large a body of men as the wicked
suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of
a woman, and hovered over his head saying, "My poor unhappy man, why do
you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside
it, and s'is your son wh'is just such a young man as any father may
be proud of."
"Goddess," answered Ulysses, "all that you have said is true, but I am
in some doubt as t'how I shall be able t'kill these wicked suitors
single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there
is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing
that with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must
ask you t'consider where I am t'escape t'from their avengers when it
is all over."
"For shame," replied Minerva, "why, any one else would trust a worse
ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less
wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you
throughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though
there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager t'kill us, you
should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you.
But g't'sleep; it is a very bad thing t'lie awake all night, and you
shall be out of your troubles before long."
As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to
Olympus.`,length:3028,num_lines:48,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Angry and conflicted",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Heart, be still, you had worse than this t'bear on the day when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of being killed.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Minerva",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character providing guidance",emotion:"Supportive and reassuring",sentiment:.5,quote:"For shame, replied Minerva, why, any one else would trust a worse ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less wise than I am.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Penelope's Prayer",summary:"Penelope prays to Diana for relief from her sorrow.",chapter:"BOOK XX",first_line:49,last_line:75,explanation:"Location changes to Penelope's chamber.",text:`While Ulysses was thus yielding himself t'a very deep slumber that

his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had
lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock's
hide out int'the open. He lifted up his hands t'heaven, and prayed,

when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman
from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another
sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was t'grind
wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground
their task and had gone t'take their rest, but this one had not yet

Telemachus als'rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about
his shoulder, bound his sandals on t'his comely feet, and took a
doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went t'the
threshold of the cloister and said t'Euryclea, "Nurse, did you make
the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let
him shift for himself?—for my mother, good woman though she is, has a

went t'the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to
work about the house. The men wh'were in attendance on the suitors

from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three
best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and
then he said good-humouredly t'Ulysses, "Stranger, are the suitors
treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?"
"May heaven," answered Ulysses, "requite t'them the wickedness with
which they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense
of shame."
Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for
he to'was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner; and he
had tw'shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,
and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. "Are you still here,
stranger," said he, "t'pester people by begging about the house? Why
can you not g'elsewhere? You and I shall not come t'an understanding
before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without
any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the
Achaeans, as well as here?"
Ulysses made n'answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third
man, Philoetius, joined them, wh'was bringing in a barren heifer and
some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen wh'are there to
take people over when any one comes t'them. S'Philoetius made his
heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to
the swineherd. "Who, Swineherd," said he, "is this stranger that is
lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does
he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man,
but the gods give sorrow t'whom they will—even t'kings if it so
pleases them."

poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father
Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,

take n'heed t'his son though he is in the house, and fear not the
wrath of heaven, but are already eager t'divide Ulysses' property
among them because he has been away s'long. I have often thought—only
it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with the
cattle t'some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still
harder t'stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. My

suitors, "Hear what I have t'say. The stranger has already had as
large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor
reasonable t'ill-treat any guest of Telemachus wh'comes here. I will,
however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have
something t'give t'the bath-woman, or t'some other of Ulysses'
servants."
As he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which
it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little
aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion159 as he did
so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to
Ctesippus, "It is a good thing for you," said he, "that the stranger
turned his head s'that you missed him. If you had hit him I should
have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to
see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. S'let
me have n'more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up
now t'the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,
instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long
seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have
put up with this, for one man is n'match for many, but d'me no
further violence. Still, if you wish t'kill me, kill me; I would far
rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day—guests
insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an
unseemly way."
They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,
"N'one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it,
for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the
stranger, or any one else of the servants wh'are about the house; I
would say, however, a friendly word t'Telemachus and his mother, which
I trust may commend itself t'both. 'As long,' I would say, 'as you had
ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, n'one could
complain of your waiting and suffering160 the suitors t'be in your
house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but it
is now sufficiently clear that he will never d'so; therefore talk all
this quietly over with your mother, and tell her t'marry the best man,
and the one wh'makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will
yourself be able t'manage your own inheritance, and t'eat and drink
in peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not
yours.'"
T'this Telemachus answered, "By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of
my unhappy father, wh'has either perished far from Ithaca, or is
wandering in some distant land, I throw n'obstacles in the way of my
mother's marriage; on the contrary I urge her t'choose whomsoever she
will, and I will give her numberless gifts int'the bargain, but I dare
not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own
wishes. Heaven forbid that I should d'this."
Minerva now made the suitors fall t'laughing immoderately, and set
their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.

full of ghosts trooping down int'the night of hell; the sun is blotted

Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus
then said, "This stranger wh'has lately come here has lost his senses.
Servants, turn him out int'the streets, since he finds it s'dark
here."
But Theoclymenus said, "Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me.
I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, t'say nothing of an
understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I
see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men wh'are
insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be
able t'escape."
He left the house as he spoke, and went back t'Piraeus wh'gave him
welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking
Telemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to
him, "Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this
importunate tramp, wh'comes begging bread and wine and has n'skill
for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here
is another fellow wh'is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me
persuade you, for it will be much better t'put them on board ship and
send them off t'the Sicels t'sell for what they will bring."
Telemachus gave him n'heed, but sat silently watching his father,
expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.
Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat
placed for her facing the court and cloisters, s'that she could hear
what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid
much merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had
sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet t'come, and nothing

AND PHILOETIUS
Minerva now put it in Penelope's mind t'make the suitors try their
skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,
as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and
got the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of
ivory; she then went with her maidens int'the store-room at the end of
the house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought
iron were kept, and where was als'his bow, and the quiver full of
deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in
Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The tw'fell in with one another
in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in
order t'recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the
Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had
sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these
Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and
the other chieftains sent him on a mission t'recover them. Iphitus had
gone there als't'try and get back twelve brood mares that he had
lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were
the death of him in the end, for when he went t'the house of Jove's
son, mighty Hercules, wh'performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules
t'his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not
heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set
before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the
mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and
gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used t'carry, and which
on his death had been left by him t'his son. Ulysses gave him in
return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast
friendship, although they never visited at one another's houses, for
Jove's son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could d'so. This bow,
then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when
he sailed for Troy; he had used it s'long as he had been at home, but
had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.
Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the
carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it s'as t'get
it quite straight; he had then set the door posts int'it and hung the
doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the
key, and drove it straight home t'shoot back the bolts that held the
doors;161 these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a
meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests
stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with
fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow
case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,
weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her
tears had relieved her, she went t'the cloister where the suitors
were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that
were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that
contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.
When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts
supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face,
and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:
"Listen t'me you suitors, wh'persist in abusing the hospitality of
this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other
pretext than that you want t'marry me; this, then, being the prize
that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of
Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his
arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this
house of my lawful husband, s'goodly, and s'abounding in wealth. But
even s'I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams."
As she spoke, she told Eumaeus t'set the bow and the pieces of iron
before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them t'd'as she had`,length:4114,num_lines:61,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Penelope",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central figure in the scene",emotion:"Sorrowful yet determined",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I will bring out the mighty bow of Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this house of my lawful husband, s'goodly, and s'abounding in wealth.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Supportive character to Penelope",emotion:"Sadness and loyalty",sentiment:-.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Eumaeus feels deep sorrow as he assists Penelope, reflecting his loyalty and emotional connection to her plight.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Contest Begins",summary:"Telemachus announces the contest for the bow.",chapter:"BOOK XXI",first_line:62,last_line:105,explanation:"Location changes to the cloister where the suitors are.",text:`bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept als'when he saw his master's
bow, but Antinous scolded them. "You country louts," said he, "silly
simpletons; why should you add t'the sorrows of your mistress by
crying in this way? She has enough t'grieve her in the loss of her
husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go
outside if you want t'cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors
shall have t'contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it
n'light matter t'string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of
us all wh'is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember
him, though I was then only a child."
This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting t'be able to
string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was t'be
the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,
whom he was dishonouring in his own house—egging the others on t'd'so
also.
Then Telemachus spoke. "Great heavens!" he exclaimed, "Jove must have
robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she
will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying
myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the
contest has been agreed upon, let it g'forward. It is for a woman
whose peer is not t'be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in
Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need
have I t'speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make n'excuses
for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too
will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the
iron, I shall not suffer my mother t'quit this house with a stranger,
not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me."
As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,
and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row,
in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by
line.162 Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was
surprised when they saw him set them up s'orderly, though he had never
seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on t'the pavement
t'make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his
might t'draw the string, and thrice he had t'leave off, though he had
hoped t'string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for
the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign
t'check him in spite of all his eagerness. S'he said:
"Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of n'prowess, or I am too
young, and have not yet reached my full strength s'as t'be able to
hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, wh'are
stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled."
On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led
int'the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.`,length:2924,num_lines:44,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Antinous",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Antinous is a key antagonist in this scene.",emotion:"Arrogant and dismissive",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Antinous is dismissive of the concerns of others, showing his arrogance and lack of compassion.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Telemachus is central to the conflict and emotional stakes.",emotion:"Frustrated and determined",sentiment:.2,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus feels frustrated and determined, indicating his struggle against the chaos surrounding him.",importance_rank:1}],number:2,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Ulysses Reveals Himself",summary:"Ulysses speaks to Eumaeus and Philoetius, revealing his identity.",chapter:"BOOK XXI",first_line:146,last_line:184,explanation:"Location changes outside the house.",text:`Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the
outer yard, Ulysses said t'them quietly:
"Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in
doubt whether t'say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of
men would you be t'stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back
here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed t'do—t'side with the
suitors, or with Ulysses?"
"Father Jove," answered the stockman, "would indeed that you might so
ordain it. If some god were but t'bring Ulysses back, you should see
with what might and main I would fight for him."
In like words Eumaeus prayed t'all the gods that Ulysses might return;
when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses
said, "It is I, Ulysses, wh'am here. I have suffered much, but at
last, in the twentieth year, I am come back t'my own country. I find
that you tw'alone of all my servants are glad that I should d'so, for
I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. T'you two,
therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall
deliver the suitors int'my hands, I will find wives for both of you,
will give you house and holding close t'my own, and you shall be t'me
as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give
you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is
the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on
Mt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus."
As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they
had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw
their arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses
kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down
upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:
"Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and
tell those wh'are within. When you g'in, d's'separately, not both
together; I will g'first, and d'you follow afterwards; let this
moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to
prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; d'you, therefore,
Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell
the women t'close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any
groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not
come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.

Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, s'he put the bow

Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put

outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in the
gatehouse, s'he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,
resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who
had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,
and proving it all over t'see whether the worms had been eating into
its tw'horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his
neighbour saying, "This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has
got one like it at home, or he wants t'make one, in such workmanlike
style does the old vagabond handle it."
Another said, "I hope he may be n'more successful in other things than
he is likely t'be in stringing this bow."
But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung
it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes
the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to
prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the
twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour
as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a
sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the
son of scheming Saturn had sent him.
He took an arrow that was lying upon the table165—for those which the
Achaeans were s'shortly about t'taste were all inside the quiver—he
laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow
and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken
aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of
the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them,
and int'the outer courtyard. Then he said t'Telemachus:
"Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I
aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,
and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for

with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to
the ground at his feet and said, "The mighty contest is at an end. I
will now see whether Apoll'will vouchsafe it t'me t'hit another mark

that one man, however brave, would stand alone among s'many and kill
him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the point went clean
through his neck, s'that he fell over and the cup dropped from his
hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked
the table from him and upset the things on it, s'that the bread and
roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on t'the ground.166
The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit;
they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked
everywhere towards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear,

wasted my substance,167 have forced my women servants t'lie with you,
and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared
neither God nor man, and now you shall die."
They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round
about t'see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone
spoke.
"If you are Ulysses," said he, "then what you have said is just. We
have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who
was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all
his doing. It was not that he wanted t'marry Penelope; he did not so

and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and
we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened.
Until we have done this n'one can complain of your being enraged
against us."
Ulysses again glared at him and said, "Though you should give me all

will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must
fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall."`,length:1697,num_lines:27,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Angry and vengeful",sentiment:-1,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Odysseus is filled with anger and a desire for vengeance as he confronts the suitors who have disrespected his home and family.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eurymachus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important character trying to negotiate",emotion:"Fearful and desperate",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Eurymachus feels fearful and desperate, acknowledging their wrongdoings and hoping to save themselves by blaming Antinous.",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:3},{title:"The Fight Begins",summary:"The suitors attempt to fight back against Ulysses.",chapter:"BOOK XXII",first_line:52,last_line:80,explanation:"Shift to the battle scene.",text:`Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:

show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables t'shield you from
his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, t'drive him from the
pavement and doorway: we can then get through int'the town, and raise
such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."
As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,
and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot
an arrow int'his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself
in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.
The cup and all the meats went over on t'the ground as he smote the
earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the
stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.
Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses t'try and
get him away from the door; but Telemachus was to'quick for him, and
struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and
went right through his chest, s'that he fell heavily t'the ground and
struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from
him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he
stayed t'draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack
at him with his sword, or knock him down, s'he set off at a run, and
immediately was at his father's side. Then he said:
"Father, let me bring you a shield, tw'spears, and a brass helmet for
your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour
for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed."
"Run and fetch them," answered Ulysses, "while my arrows hold out, or
when I am alone they may get me away from the door."

He chose four shields, eight spears, and four
brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to
his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the
swineherd als'put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses.
Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the
suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows
gave out, he set the bow t'stand against the end wall of the house by
the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders;
on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of
horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,168 and he grasped two
redoubtable bronze-shod spears.
Now there was a trap door169 on the wall, while at one end of the
pavement170 there was an exit leading t'a narrow passage, and this
exit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius t'stand
by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a
time. But Agelaus shouted out, "Cannot some one g'up t'the trap door
and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we
should soon make an end of this man and his shooting."
"This may not be, Agelaus," answered Melanthius, "the mouth of the
narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance t'the outer court. One
brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I
will do, I will bring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is
there that Ulysses and his son have put them."
On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages t'the store-room
of Ulysses' house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets
and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could t'give them to
the suitors. Ulysses' heart began t'fail him when he saw the
suitors171 putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw
the greatness of the danger, and said t'Telemachus, "Some one of the
women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be
Melanthius."
Telemachus answered, "The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left
the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I
have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the
women wh'is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the
son of Dolius."
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going t'the
store room t'fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to
Ulysses wh'was beside him, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that
scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, wh'is going t'the store
room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I
bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many
wrongs that he has done in your house?"
Ulysses answered, "Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,
n'matter what they do; g'back both of you and bind Melanthius' hands
and feet behind him. Throw him int'the store room and make the door
fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him
close up t'the rafters from a high bearing-post,172 that he may linger
on in an agony."
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went t'the
store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was
busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, s'the two
took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by
Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted
shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,
but which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become
unsewn; on this the tw'seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and
threw him struggling t'the ground. They bent his hands and feet well
behind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses
had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him
up from a high pillar till he was close up t'the rafters, and over him
did you then vaunt, 'swineherd Eumaeus saying, "Melanthius, you will
pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well
when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you
t'be driving in your goats for the suitors t'feast on."
There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on
their armour they closed the door behind them and went back t'take
their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the`,length:4422,num_lines:68,location:"Ithaca",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character leading the fight",emotion:"Determined and anxious",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Odysseus feels determined yet anxious as he prepares to face the suitors, realizing the gravity of the impending conflict.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character assisting Ulysses",emotion:"Regretful and responsible",sentiment:-.5,quote:"The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I have.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Melanthius",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Key antagonist aiding the suitors",emotion:"Devious and opportunistic",sentiment:-.7,quote:"I will bring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is there that Ulysses and his son have put them.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Eumaeus",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Supportive character aiding Ulysses",emotion:"Loyal and vengeful",sentiment:.6,quote:"Melanthius, you will pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4}],number:4,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Spare the Innocent",summary:"Telemachus spares the minstrel and the herald.",chapter:"BOOK XXII",first_line:229,last_line:279,explanation:"Focus shifts to mercy amidst the chaos.",text:`Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, "Ulysses I beseech
you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women
in your house either in word or deed, and I tried t'stop the others. I
saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their
folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die
without having done anything t'deserve it, and shall have got no
thanks for all the good that I did."
Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, "If you were their
sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be
long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have
children by her. Therefore you shall die."
With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when
he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he
struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, s'that his head fell rolling
in the dust while he was yet speaking.
The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes—he wh'had been forced by the
suitors t'sing t'them—now tried t'save his life. He was standing
near towards the trap door,174 and held his lyre in his hand. He did
not know whether t'fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar
of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and
Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether t'go
straight up t'Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed
it best t'embrace Ulysses' knees. S'he laid his lyre on the ground
between the mixing bowl 175 and the silver-studded seat; then going up
t'Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, "Ulysses, I beseech
you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards
if you kill a bard wh'can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make
all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every kind of
inspiration. I would sing t'you as though you were a god, d'not
therefore be in such a hurry t'cut my head off. Your own son
Telemachus will tell you that I did not want t'frequent your house and
sing t'the suitors after their meals, but they were to'many and too
strong for me, s'they made me."
Telemachus heard him, and at once went up t'his father. "Hold!" he
cried, "the man is guiltless, d'him n'hurt; and we will spare Medon
too, wh'was always good t'me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or
Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you
were raging about the court."
Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a
seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly
flayed heifer's hide, s'he threw off the hide, went up t'Telemachus,
and laid hold of his knees.
"Here I am, my dear sir," said he, "stay your hand therefore, and tell
your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for
having wasted his substance and been s'foolishly disrespectful to
yourself."
Ulysses smiled at him and answered, "Fear not; Telemachus has saved
your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how
greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore,
outside the cloisters int'the outer court, and be out of the way of

by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting
that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court
carefully over, t'see if anyone had managed t'hide himself and was
still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in
their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of
the sea, and thrown upon the beach t'lie gasping for water till the
heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even s'were the suitors lying
all huddled up one against the other.
Then Ulysses said t'Telemachus, "Call nurse Euryclea; I have something
t'say t'her."
Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. "Make
haste," said he, "you old woman wh'have been set over all the other
women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes t'speak t'you."
When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room
and came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses
bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been
devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so
that he is a fearful sight; even s'was Ulysses besmirched from head to
foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of
blood, she was beginning t'cry out for joy, for she saw that a great
deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, "Old woman," said he,
"rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and d'not make any noise about
it; it is an unholy thing t'vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and
their own evil deeds have brought these men t'destruction, for they
respected n'man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, wh'came
near them, and they have come t'a bad end as a punishment for their
wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the
house have misconducted themselves, and wh'are innocent."176
"I will tell you the truth, my son," answered Euryclea. "There are
fifty women in the house whom we teach t'd'things, such as carding
wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all177 have
misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect t'me, and als'to
Penelope. They showed n'disrespect t'Telemachus, for he has only
lately grown and his mother never permitted him t'give orders t'the
female servants; but let me g'upstairs and tell your wife all that has
happened, for some god has been sending her t'sleep."
"D'not wake her yet," answered Ulysses, "but tell the women wh'have
misconducted themselves t'come t'me."
Euryclea left the cloister t'tell the women, and make them come to
Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the
swineherd. "Begin," said he, "t'remove the dead, and make the women
help you. Then, get sponges and clean water t'swill down the tables
and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take
the women int'the space between the domed room and the wall of the
outer court, and run them through with your swords till they are quite
dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used
t'lie in secret with the suitors."
On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.
First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one
another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do
their work quickly, s'they had t'carry the bodies out. When they had
done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and
water, while Telemachus and the tw'others shovelled up the blood and
dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out
of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and
orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space
between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, s'that they
could not get away: and Telemachus said t'the other two, "I shall not
let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent t'me and my
mother, and used t'sleep with the suitors."
S'saying he made a ship's cable fast t'one of the bearing-posts that
supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the
building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch
the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been
set for them in a thicket just as they were getting t'their nest, and
a terrible fate awaits them, even s'did the women have t'put their
heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.178 Their
feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.
As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister int'the inner
court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his
vitals and gave them t'the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut
off his hands and his feet.
When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back
int'the house, for all was now over; and Ulysses said t'the dear old
nurse Euryclea, "Bring me sulphur, which cleanses all pollution, and
fetch fire als'that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters. Go,
moreover, and tell Penelope t'come here with her attendants, and also

Euryclea now went upstairs laughing t'tell her mistress that her dear
husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet
were nimble for joy as she went up t'her mistress and bent over her
head t'speak t'her. "Wake up Penelope, my dear child," she exclaimed,
"and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this
long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has
killed the suitors wh'were giving s'much trouble in his house, eating
up his estate and ill treating his son."
"My good nurse," answered Penelope, "you must be mad. The gods
sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and make
foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing
t'you; for you always used t'be a reasonable person. Why should you
thus mock me when I have trouble enough already—talking such nonsense,
and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my
eyes and closed them? I have never slept s'soundly from the day my
poor husband went t'that city with the ill-omened name. G'back again
int'the women's room; if it had been any one else wh'had woke me up
t'bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe
scolding. As it is your age shall protect you."
"My dear child," answered Euryclea, "I am not mocking you. It is quite
true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger
whom they all kept on treating s'badly in the cloister. Telemachus
knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret
that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people."
Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,
and wept for joy. "But my dear nurse," said she, "explain this t'me;
if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage t'overcome
the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there
always were?"
"I was not there," answered Euryclea, "and d'not know; I only heard
them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and
huddled up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till
your son came t'fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found
Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all
round him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you
could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and
filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled
up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a

you, s'come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for

consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away from the
Achaean land; he will never return home again."
Then nurse Euryclea said, "My child, what are you talking about? but
you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your
husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own
fire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;
when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave
him, and I wanted t'tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not
let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; s'come with me and I will
make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you, you may have me
killed by the most cruel death you can think of."
"My dear nurse," said Penelope, "however wise you may be you can hardly
fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will g'in search of
my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man wh'has`,length:1397,num_lines:21,location:"Ithaca",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Penelope",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Penelope is crucial as she expresses doubt about Ulysses' return.",emotion:"Skeptical and hopeful",sentiment:.2,quote:"You know how delighted every one would be t'see Ulysses come home—more particularly myself, and the son wh'has been born t'both of us; but what you tell me cannot be really true.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Euryclea",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Euryclea plays a key role in trying to convince Penelope of Ulysses' return.",emotion:"Confident and reassuring",sentiment:.5,quote:"when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave him, and I wanted t'tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; s'come with me and I will make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you, you may have me killed by the most cruel death you can think of.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Penelope's Decision 2",summary:"Penelope decides to see Ulysses.",chapter:"BOOK XXIII",first_line:67,last_line:90,explanation:"Penelope comes down to meet Ulysses.",text:`killed them."
On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing s'she
considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and
question him, or whether she should at once g'up t'him and embrace
him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,
she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right
angles180 [t'that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near
one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting t'see
what his brave wife would say t'him when she saw him. For a long time
she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked
him full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his
shabby clothes and failed t'recognise him,181 till Telemachus began to
reproach her and said:
"Mother—but you are s'hard that I cannot call you by such a name—why
d'you keep away from my father in this way? Why d'you not sit by his
side and begin talking t'him and asking him questions? N'other woman
could bear t'keep away from her husband when he had come back t'her
after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through s'much;
but your heart always was as hard as a stone."
Penelope answered, "My son, I am s'lost in astonishment that I can
find n'words in which either t'ask questions or t'answer them. I
cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is

Ulysses smiled at this, and said t'Telemachus, "Let your mother put me
t'any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.
She rejects me for the moment and believes me t'be somebody else,
because I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,
however, consider what we had better d'next. When one man has killed
another—even though he was not one wh'would leave many friends t'take
up his quarrel—the man wh'has killed him must still say good bye to
his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay
of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you
consider this matter."
"Look t'it yourself, father," answered Telemachus, "for they say you
are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is n'other
mortal man wh'can compare with you. We will follow you with right good
will, nor shall you find us fail you in s'far as our strength holds
out."
"I will say what I think will be best," answered Ulysses. "First wash
and put your shirts on; tell the maids als't'g't'their own room and
dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, s'that
if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going
along the street happens t'notice it, they may think there is a
wedding in the house, and n'rumours about the death of the suitors
will get about in the town, before we can escape t'the woods upon my
own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven
vouchsafes us shall seem wisest."
Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed
and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took
his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The
house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people
outside said, "I suppose the queen has been getting married at last.
She ought t'be ashamed of herself for not continuing t'protect her
husband's property until he comes home."182
This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had
been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses
in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him
look taller and stronger than before; she als'made the hair grow thick
on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;
she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful
workman wh'has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva—and
his work is full of beauty—enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding
it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat
down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. "My dear," said he,
"heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever
yet had. N'other woman could bear t'keep away from her husband when
he had come back t'her after twenty years of absence, and after having
gone through s'much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will
sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron."
"My dear," answered Penelope, "I have n'wish t'set myself up, nor to
depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well
remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.
Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he
himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it
with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets."
She said this t'try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, "Wife, I
am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Wh'has been
taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it
a hard task, n'matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god
came and helped him t'shift it. There is n'man living, however strong
and in his prime, wh'could move it from its place, for it is a
marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a
young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour,
and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with
strong walls of stone and a roof t'cover them, and I made the doors
strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive
tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root
upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skilfully,
straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into
a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the
centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it,
inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of
crimson leather from one side of it t'the other. S'you see I know all
about it, and I desire t'learn whether it is still there, or whether
any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its
roots."
When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke
down. She flew weeping t'his side, flung her arms about his neck, and
kissed him. "D'not be angry with me Ulysses," she cried, "you, wh'are
the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied
us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together;
d'not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you
thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through
fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story;
for there are many very wicked people going about. Jove's daughter
Helen would never have yielded herself t'a man from a foreign country,
if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and
bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart t'd'wrong, and she gave no
thought t'that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now,
however, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about
our bed (which n'human being has ever seen but you and I and a single
maidservant, the daughter of Actor, wh'was given me by my father on my
marriage, and wh'keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I
have been I can mistrust n'longer."`,length:6046,num_lines:92,location:"Ithaca",importance:1,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Frustrated and determined",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Odysseus feels frustrated and determined, recognizing the strength of Penelope's character while asserting his own.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Somewhat important character in the scene",emotion:"Supportive and respectful",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus is supportive and respectful, encouraging his father to take charge and trust in his wisdom.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Penelope",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in the scene",emotion:"Skeptical yet relieved",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Penelope feels skeptical yet relieved, asking for understanding from Ulysses while acknowledging his wisdom.",importance_rank:2}],number:4,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Plans for the Future",summary:"Ulysses shares his plans after the suitors' defeat.",chapter:"BOOK XXIII",first_line:183,last_line:278,explanation:"Ulysses discusses future actions with Penelope.",text:`Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and
faithful wife t'his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome t'men who
are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship
with the fury of his winds and waves; a few alone reach the land, and
these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on
firm ground and out of danger—even s'was her husband welcome t'her as
she looked upon him, and she could not tear her tw'fair arms from
about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow
till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise,
and held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to
leave Oceanus, nor t'yoke the tw'steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear
her onward t'break the day upon mankind.
At last, however, Ulysses said, "Wife, we have not yet reached the end
of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still t'undergo. It
is long and difficult, but I must g'through with it, for thus the
shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went
down int'Hades t'ask about my return and that of my companions. But
now let us g't'bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon
of sleep."
"You shall g't'bed as soon as you please," replied Penelope, "now
that the gods have sent you home t'your own good house and t'your
country. But as heaven has put it in your mind t'speak of it, tell me
about the task that lies before you. I shall have t'hear about it
later, s'it is better that I should be told at once."
"My dear," answered Ulysses, "why should you press me t'tell you?
Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I
d'not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,
carrying an oar, till I came t'a country where the people have never
heard of the sea, and d'not even mix salt with their food. They know
nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave
me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a
wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel
that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was t'fix my oar in the ground
and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar t'Neptune; after which I was
t'g'home and offer hecatombs t'all the gods in heaven, one after the
other. As for myself, he said that death should come t'me from the
sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of
years and peace of mind, and my people should bless me. All this, he
said, should surely come t'pass."
And Penelope said, "If the gods are going t'vouchsafe you a happier
time in your old age, you may hope then t'have some respite from
misfortune."
Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches
and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid
them, the nurse went back int'the house t'g't'her rest, leaving the
bed chamber woman Eurynome183 t'show Ulysses and Penelope t'bed by
torch light. When she had conducted them t'their room she went back,
and they then came joyfully t'the rites of their own old bed.
Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and
made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down t'sleep
in the cloisters.
When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking
with one another. She told him how much she had had t'bear in seeing
the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors wh'had killed s'many
sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk s'many casks of wine.
Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble
he had himself given t'other people. He told her everything, and she
was s'delighted t'listen that she never went t'sleep till he had
ended his whole story.
He began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached
the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops
and how he had punished him for having s'ruthlessly eaten his brave
comrades; how he then went on t'Aeolus, wh'received him hospitably
and furthered him on his way, but even s'he was not t'reach home, for
t'his great grief a hurricane carried him out t'sea again; how he
went on t'the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed
all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.
Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed t'the
chill house of Hades, t'consult the ghost of the Theban prophet
Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who
bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the
wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on t'the wandering rocks and
terrible Charybdis and t'Scylla, whom n'man had ever yet passed in
safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove
therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, s'that all his men
perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at last he
reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, wh'kept him there in
a cave, and fed him, and wanted him t'marry her, in which case she
intended making him immortal s'that he should never grow old, but she
could not persuade him t'let her d'so; and how after much suffering
he had found his way t'the Phaeacians, wh'had treated him as though
he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship t'his own country after
having given him gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was
the last thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold
upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.
Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that
Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned
Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On
this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said t'Penelope,
"Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in
lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though
I was longing all the time t'd'so. Now, however, that we have at last
come together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for
the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take
many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to
make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards.

As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,
Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all t'put on their armour also.
This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened
the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now

Then Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his
hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes in
sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts
and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As
bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them
has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even s'did the
ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down
int'the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of
Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came t'the gates of the sun and the
land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell
the souls and shadows of them that can labour n'more.
Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of
Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, wh'was the finest and handsomest man
of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.
They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of
Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also
the ghosts of those wh'had perished with him in the house of
Aegisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.
"Son of Atreus," it said, "we used t'say that Jove had loved you
better from first t'last than any other hero, for you were captain
over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before
Troy; yet the hand of death, which n'mortal can escape, was laid upon
you all to'early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day
of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your
ashes, and your son would have been heir t'your good name, whereas it
has now been your lot t'come t'a most miserable end."
"Happy son of Peleus," answered the ghost of Agamemnon, "for having
died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the
Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the
whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your
chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever
have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane t'stay us. Then, when
we had borne you t'the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed
and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The
Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,
when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and
the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters s'that the
Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken t'their
ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked
them saying, 'Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his
mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs t'view the body of
her son.'
"Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared n'more. The daughters of the
old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in
immortal raiment. The nine muses als'came and lifted up their sweet
voices in lament—calling and answering one another; there was not an
Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights
seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the
eighteenth day we gave you t'the flames, and many a fat sheep with
many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in
raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,
horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were
burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of
heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak
and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a
golden vase t'hold them—gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;
in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus wh'had
gone before you, and separate we enclosed als'those of Antilochus, who
had been closer t'you than any other of your comrades now that
Patroclus was n'more.
"Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point
jutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far
out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born
hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to
be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been
present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird
themselves and make ready t'contend for prizes on the death of some
great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis
offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death
your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore
among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my
fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the
hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife."
Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up t'them with the
ghosts of the suitors wh'had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of
Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to
them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of
Melaneus, wh'lived in Ithaca and had been his host, s'it began to
talk t'him.
"Amphimedon," it said, "what has happened t'all you fine young men—all
of an age too—that you are come down here under the ground? One could
pick n'finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds
and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an
end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or
sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?
Answer my question, for I have been your guest. D'you not remember how
I came t'your house with Menelaus, t'persuade Ulysses t'join us with
his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our
voyage, for we had hard work t'persuade Ulysses t'come with us."
And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, "Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king
of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you
fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.
Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, wh'did not
say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters t'an
end, for she meant t'compass our destruction: this, then, was the
trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and
began t'work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,'
said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, d'not press me t'marry
again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in needlework
perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the her'Laertes,
against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the
women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This is
what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon
her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches
again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without
our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth
year, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one
of her maids wh'knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in
the act of undoing her work, s'she had t'finish it whether she would
or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had
it washed,186 its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.
"Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses t'the upland farm where his
swineherd lives. Thither presently came als'his son, returning from a
voyage t'Pylos, and the tw'came t'the town when they had hatched
their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after
him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and
leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came
s'unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among
us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being
struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but
when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus
took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors
behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a
quantity of iron t'be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this
was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the
bow—nor nearly d'so. When it was about t'reach the hands of Ulysses,
we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, n'matter
what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he
had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow
through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured
his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed
Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly
darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of
the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main
throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as
our brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our
blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are
lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at
home d'not yet know what has happened, s'that they cannot lay us out
and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according
t'the offices due t'the departed."
"Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes," replied the ghost of Agamemnon, "you
are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare
excellence of understanding, and s'faithful t'her wedded lord as
Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue
shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be
welcome t'all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far
otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus wh'killed
her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has
brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones."

Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the
town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which
he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a
lean-t'running all round it, where the slaves wh'worked for him slept
and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman,
wh'looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there,
he said t'his son and t'the other two:
"G't'the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.
Meanwhile I want t'see whether my father will know me, or fail to
recognise me after s'long an absence."
He then took off his armour and gave it t'Eumaeus and Philoetius, who
went straight on t'the house, while he turned off int'the vineyard to
make trial of his father. As he went down int'the great orchard, he
did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for
they were all gathering thorns t'make a fence for the vineyard, at the
place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father
alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very
shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide t'save him
from the brambles, and he als'wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat
skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw
him s'worn, s'old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall
pear tree and began t'weep. He doubted whether t'embrace him, kiss
him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should
first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it
best t'be crafty with him, s'in this mind he went up t'his father,
wh'was bending down and digging about a plant.
"I see, sir," said Ulysses, "that you are an excellent gardener—what
pains you take with it, t'be sure. There is not a single plant, not a
fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of
your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I
say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are
old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle
that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and
figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble
birth. I should have said that you were one of those wh'should wash
well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right t'do;
but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose
garden are you working? Tell me als'about another matter. Is this
place that I have come t'really Ithaca? I met a man just now wh'said
so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience t'hear my story
out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was
still living, or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me
when I tell you that this man came t'my house once when I was in my
own country and never yet did any stranger come t'me whom I liked
better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father
was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him
welcome t'all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave
him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and
a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve
light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I als'gave him twelve
cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal
number of shirts. T'all this I added four good looking women skilled
in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice."
His father shed tears and answered, "Sir, you have indeed come t'the
country that you have named, but it is fallen int'the hands of wicked
people. All this wealth of presents has been given t'n'purpose. If
you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have
entertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply
when you left him—as would have been only right considering what you
had already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is
it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!
He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have
eaten him, or he has fallen a prey t'the birds and wild beasts of some
continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, wh'were his parents,
could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could
his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as
was natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according t'the
offices due t'the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want t'know.
Wh'and whence are you—tell me of your town and parents? Where is the
ship lying that has brought you and your men t'Ithaca? Or were you a
passenger on some other man's ship, and those wh'brought you here have
gone on their way and left you?"
"I will tell you everything," answered Ulysses, "quite truly. I come
from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who
is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off
my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here
against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open
country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left
my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left
me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced
t'see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have
another friendly meeting and exchange presents."
A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both
hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey
head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,
and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang
towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, "I am he,
father, about whom you are asking—I have returned after having been
away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation—we have
n'time t'lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the
suitors in my house, t'punish them for their insolence and crimes."
"If you really are my son Ulysses," replied Laertes, "and have come
back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as
shall convince me."
"First observe this scar," answered Ulysses, "which I got from a boar's
tusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me
t'Autolycus, my mother's father, t'receive the presents which when he
was over here he had promised t'give me. Furthermore I will point out
t'you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all
about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,
and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me
thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also
said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted
between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of
heaven has been laid heavy upon them."
Laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which
his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to
support him, or he would have gone off int'a swoon; but as soon as he
came to, and was beginning t'recover his senses, he said, "'father
Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have
really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am
much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here
directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the
cities of the Cephallenians."
Ulysses answered, "Take heart and d'not trouble yourself about that,
but let us g'int'the house hard by your garden. I have already told
Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus t'g'on there and get dinner ready
as soon as possible."
Thus conversing the tw'made their way towards the house. When they got
there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting
up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took
Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on
a good cloak, and Minerva came up t'him and gave him a more imposing
presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back
his son was surprised t'see him looking s'like an immortal, and said
t'him, "My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much
taller and better-looking."
Laertes answered, "Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I
were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took
Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I
then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I
should have been able t'stand by you and help you against the suitors.
I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced
t'see it."
Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their
work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his
proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and
by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their
mother, the Sicel woman wh'looked after Laertes now that he was
growing old, had been t'fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were
certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses
scolded them good naturedly and said, "Sit down t'your dinner, old
man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting t'begin
for some time and have been waiting for you."
Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up t'Ulysses. "Sir," said
he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, "we have
long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you t'us after
we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper
you.187 But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or
shall we send some one t'tell her?"
"Old man," answered Ulysses, "she knows already, s'you need not
trouble about that." On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius
gathered round Ulysses t'give him greeting and embrace him one after
the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their
father.
While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round
the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the
suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered
from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.
They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies
of those wh'came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the
fishermen t'take each of them t'his own place. They then met angrily
in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes
rose t'speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son
Antinous, wh'had been the first man killed by Ulysses, s'he said,
weeping bitterly, "My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great
wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he
has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been
killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and
doing before he can get away t'Pylos or t'Elis where the Epeans rule,
or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an
everlasting disgrace t'us if we d'not avenge the murder of our sons
and brothers. For my own part I should have n'more pleasure in life,
but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before
they can cross over t'the main land."
He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard
Phemius had now woke up, and came t'them from the house of Ulysses.
Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle
of the assembly, and Medon said, "Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did
not d'these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an
immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god
appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously
about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on
one another."
On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of
Mastor, rose t'speak, for he was the only man among them wh'knew both
past and future; s'he spoke t'them plainly and in all honesty,
saying,
"Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as
they have; you would not listen t'me, nor yet t'Mentor, when we bade
you check the folly of your sons wh'were doing much wrong in the
wantonness of their hearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the
wife of a chieftain wh'they thought would not return. Now, however,
let it be as I say, and d'as I tell you. D'not g'out against
Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your
own heads."
This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at
once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the
speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;
they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed
themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led
them on in their folly. He thought he was going t'avenge the murder of
his son, whereas in truth he was never t'return, but was himself to
perish in his attempt.
Then Minerva said t'Jove, "Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,
answer me this question—What d'you propose t'do? Will you set them
fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?"
And Jove answered, "My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your
own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the
suitors? D'whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be
most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them
swear t'a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to
rule, while we cause the others t'forgive and forget the massacre of
their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as
heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign."
This was what Minerva was already eager t'bring about, s'down she
darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.
Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by
saying, "Some of you g'out and see if they are not getting close up to
us." S'one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on the
threshold he could see them all quite near, and said t'Ulysses, "Here
they are, let us put on our armour at once."
They put on their armour as fast as they could—that is t'say Ulysses,
his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes als'and Dolius did
the same—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they
had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,
Ulysses leading the way.
Then Jove's daughter Minerva came up t'them, having assumed the form
and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said t'his
son Telemachus, "Telemachus, now that you are about t'fight in an
engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not t'disgrace
your ancestors, wh'were eminent for their strength and courage all the
world over."
"You say truly, my dear father," answered Telemachus, "and you shall
see, if you will, that I am in n'mind t'disgrace your family."
Laertes was delighted when he heard this. "Good heavens," he exclaimed,
"what a day I am enjoying: I d'indeed rejoice at it. My son and
grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour."
On this Minerva came close up t'him and said, "Son of Arceisius—-best
friend I have in the world—pray t'the blue-eyed damsel, and t'Jove
her father; then poise your spear and hurl it."
As she spoke she infused fresh vigour int'him, and when he had prayed
t'her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet, and
the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his
armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily t'the ground.
Meantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and
smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed
every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,
only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. "Men of
Ithaca," she cried, "cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at
once without further bloodshed."
On this pale fear seized every one; they were s'frightened that their
arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of
the goddess' voice, and they fled back t'the city for their lives. But
Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down
like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire
that fell just in front of Minerva, s'she said t'Ulysses, "Ulysses,
noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry
with you."
Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed
the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace`,length:16938,num_lines:261,location:"House Of Laertes",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Odysseus",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Emotional and determined",sentiment:.8,quote:"I am he, father, about whom you are asking—I have returned after having been away for twenty years.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Laertes",importance:1,importance_exp:"Very important character in this scene",emotion:"Sorrowful and hopeful",sentiment:.5,quote:"Sir, you have indeed come t'the country that you have named, but it is fallen int'the hands of wicked people.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Dolius",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Somewhat important character in this scene",emotion:"Joyful and respectful",sentiment:.7,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Dolius expresses joy and respect, celebrating Ulysses's return after a long period of uncertainty.",importance_rank:5},{name:"Telemachus",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Important character in this scene",emotion:"Determined and proud",sentiment:.6,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Telemachus feels determined and proud, ready to defend his family's honor and reputation.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Minerva",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Important character in this scene",emotion:"Supportive and commanding",sentiment:.9,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Minerva is supportive and commanding, urging the men of Ithaca to end the conflict peacefully.",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:1}],r=[{name:"Odysseus",quote:"Tell me, 'Muse, of that ingenious her'wh'travelled far and wide",group:"Main Characters",color:"rgb(34, 139, 34)",explanation:"Green represents Odysseus's resilience and connection to nature, reflecting his journey and struggles."},{name:"Muse",quote:"Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of Jove",group:"Gods",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Calypso",quote:"No quote available",group:"Gods",color:"rgb(0, 191, 255)",explanation:"Cyan reflects Calypso's beauty and allure, as well as her role in Odysseus's captivity."},{name:"Neptune",quote:"No quote available",group:"Gods",color:"rgb(0, 0, 128)",explanation:"Navy blue signifies Neptune's power and control over the seas, representing his conflict with Odysseus."},{name:"Minerva",quote:"It is for Ulysses that my heart bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island.",group:"Gods",color:"rgb(255, 215, 0)",explanation:"Gold signifies Minerva's wisdom and divine guidance, highlighting her role as a protector."},{name:"Jove",quote:"How can I forget Ulysses than whom there is n'more capable man on earth, nor more liberal in his offerings t'the immortal gods that live in heaven?",group:"Gods",color:"rgb(255, 215, 0)",explanation:"Gold symbolizes Jove's authority and power as the king of the gods."},{name:"Telemachus",quote:"I hope, sir, that you will not be offended with what I am going t'say.",group:"Main Characters",color:"rgb(70, 130, 180)",explanation:"Blue symbolizes Telemachus's hope and determination as he seeks news of his father."},{name:"Penelope",quote:"...for it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I mourn ever without ceasing...",group:"Main Characters",color:"rgb(255, 192, 203)",explanation:"Pink represents Penelope's love and longing for Odysseus, embodying her patience and sorrow."},{name:"Mentes",quote:"No quote available",group:"Gods",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Suitors",quote:"As soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink they",group:"Main Characters",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Maid Servant",quote:"A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it int'a silver basin for them t'wash their hands.",group:"Servants",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Upper Servant",quote:"An upper servant brought them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.",group:"Servants",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Carver",quote:"the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side.",group:"Servants",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Manservant",quote:"a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them.",group:"Servants",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Phemius",quote:"No quote available",group:"Main Characters",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Laertes",quote:"They say, however, that he never comes t'town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with an old woman t'look after him and get his dinner for him.",group:"Main Characters",color:"",explanation:""},{name:"Antinous",quote:"The gods seem t'have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking;
