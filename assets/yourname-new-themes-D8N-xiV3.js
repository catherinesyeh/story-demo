I've been dreaming. I sit up in bed.
In that two-second span, the sense of unity that enveloped me a
moment earlier vanishes without a trace, without an echo. It's so
sudden that, before I have time to so much as form a thought, the
tears come.
Every so often when I wake up in the morning, for some reason,
I'm crying.
...And I can never remember what I was dreaming about.
I wipe the tears away with my right hand, then stare at it.
Little drops of water dot my index finger. Both the dream and
the tears that briefly filled my eyes have already evaporated.

I don't know.
I give up, get out of bed, leave my room, and head for the

An alarm? But I'm still sleepy. I was in the zone drawing last night and
didn't get to bed until it was almost dawn.
"...ki... Taki."
Now somebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.A girl?
"Taki, Taki."
Her voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
"Don't you remember me?" the voice asks me anxiously.
No, I don't know you.
Suddenly, the train stops, and the doors open. Oh, right—I was on a train.
The moment I realize this, I'm standing in a packed train car. A pair of wide
eyes hovers right in front of me. A girl in a uniform is staring straight at me, but
the press of disembarking passengers is pushing her farther away.
"My name is Mitsuha!"
The girl shouts, undoing the cord she'd used to tie back her hair and holding
it out to me. Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray
of evening sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that
color tight.
At that point, my eyes open.
The girl's voice—its echoes—still whispers in my ears.
.. .Her name is Mitsuha?
I don't know the name, and I don't know the girl. She looked really
desperate somehow. Her eyes were brimming with tears. I'd never seen the
style of uniform she was wearing. Her expression was serious, even grave, as
if the fate of the universe rested in her hands.

As I open the sliding door and step into the living room, Yotsuha's
accusation flies to greet me.
"I'll fix breakfast tomorrow!" I say by way of apology.
This kid hasn't even lost all her baby teeth yet, but she seems convinced
she's handling life better than her big sister. I can't show weakness by
apologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white
helping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.
"Thanks for the food!"
I pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,
and put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel
eyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.
"So you're normal today, are you?"
"Huh?"
Gran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.
"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!" Yotsuha smirks at me. "Screamin'
all of a sudden like that."
Screaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,
I'm sure).
"Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!"
Seriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.
Ding-dong-ding-do oong.
Suddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.
"Good morning, everyone."
The voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the
Regional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a
dinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either
know each other or at least know someone in common.
"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori."
The slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. "Here
are...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori." There are speakers
outside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and
overlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.
Twice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast
plays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the
daily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how
to contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,
today's funerals.
"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on
the twentieth of next month, the town election management committee
has—"
Click.
The speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's
pulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but
even so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by
her chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.
Picking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts
speaking.
"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only
once every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be
visible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the
corner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation
to study it."
There's a line of text on the screen —Comet Tiamat visible to the naked
eye next month —and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its
momentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and
the NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like
whispered chatter during class.
"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?"
Out of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.
"It's an adult problem," I snap at her.
That's right—this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the
wind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.
Saying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.`,length:3644,num_lines:64,location:"Itomori",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Family Dynamics",role:"Explores sibling relationships and generational differences",importance:.8,emotion:"Frustration and affection",sentiment:.5,quote:"This kid hasn't even lost all her baby teeth yet, but she seems convinced she's handling life better than her big sister.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Community Life",role:"Highlights the small-town atmosphere and local connections",importance:.7,emotion:"Nostalgia and familiarity",sentiment:.6,quote:"This place, Itomori, is a dinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Celestial Events",role:"Sets the stage for upcoming significant events and their impact",importance:.6,emotion:"Excitement and anticipation",sentiment:.7,quote:"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only once every twelve hundred years.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Adult Problems",role:"Introduces themes of maturity and the complexities of adult life",importance:.7,emotion:"Frustration and confusion",sentiment:-.4,quote:"It's an adult problem.",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:5},{title:"School Life",summary:"Taki interacts with friends and reflects on her strange behavior.",chapter:"Chapter Two The Beginning",first_line:241,last_line:350,text:`With a sharp tak, tak, tak, the teacher writes a short poem on the blackboard.
Please don't ask me "Who goes there?" I'm waiting
here for my love, in the September dew.
"Tasokare , 'who goes there?' This is the origin of the term tasogare, or
twilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?"
Speaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big
letters on the blackboard.
"It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,
making it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that
isn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has
another name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had
other names."
Miss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just
shuffling around the same letters.
"'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl "
Somebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of
course, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was
little is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,
our classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school
like this.
"I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori
still use ancient Japanese words here and there."
"'Cause this here's the sticks," proclaims one of the boys, and people start
giggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to
ask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were
abandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly
pondering, I flip through my notebook, and then—on a page that should be
blank—I see something written in big letters:
Who are you?
...Huh?
What is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being
absorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my
notebook to anybody, either. What? "Who am I?" What's that supposed to
mean?
"...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!"
"Oh! Yes'm!" I stand up hastily.
"Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please," Miss Yuki tells me.
Scrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, "Good to see that you
remember your name today, Miss Miyamizu."
At that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is
going on?!
"You don't remember?"
"...No."
"For real?"
"Yes, for real," I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's
looking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.
".. .No, listen. Yesterday, you forgot where your desk and your locker were.
Your hair was all mussed and cowlicky, and you hadn't tied it back. You didn't
wear your uniform ribbon, and you were crabby the whole time."
I try visualizing what that must've looked like.What?
"What?! No way, are you serious?!"
"Yeah, you acted like you had amnesia or somethin' yesterday."
Flustered, I try to think back... Something really is off here. I can't
remember yesterday. Or, no—I do remember little bits and pieces.
There was.. .an unfamiliar town somewhere?
A reflection in a mirror.. .a boy?
I try to retrace my memories. Piihyororooo. In the distance, a kite mocks
me. It's lunchtime, and we're chatting in a corner of the schoolyard, juice
boxes in hand.
"Umrn... It feels like I spent the whole day in this weird dream. Like...a
dream about somebody else's life? .. .Mm, I can't remember much of it..."
"I got it!"
Tesshi shouts all of a sudden, and I jump. He snatches up his half-read issue
of the occult magazine MU and shoves it under our noses, spit flying
enthusiastically.
"Memories of your past life! That's what that is! Yeah, I know you're gonna
say that ain't scientific, but if you put it another way and say your unconscious
mind got linked up with a multi verse based on Everett's many-worlds
interpretation—"
"You shut your piehole," Saya scolds him sharply.
"Hey! Were you the one who scribbled in my notebook?!" I erupt at almost
the same time.
"Huh? Scribbled?"
Oh, I guess not. Tesshi's not the type to pull a lame prank like that, and he
didn't have a motive, either.
"Um, nothin'. Never mind," I say, backing down.
"Say what? Whaddaya mean, 'scribbled'? Ami a suspect for somethin'?"
"I told you, forget it."
"Whoa, Mitsuha, you're so mean! Did you hear that, Saya? I've been
falsely accused! Framed! Call a prosecutor, gimme a prosecutor! Or wait,
maybe that's a lawyer. Hey, which one are you supposed to get for stuff like
this?"
"Anyway, Mitsuha, you really were kinda funny yesterday," Saya says,
grandly ignoring Tesshi's complaints. "Were you feelin' sick?"
"Hmm... That's so weird. Maybe I really am stressed..."
I think back on all the accounts I've gotten so far.
Tesshi's already absorbed in his magazine again, as if nothing ever
happened. That's one of his virtues, the way he just lets stuff go.
"That's gotta be it! You've had all kinds of stress lately!"
She's right. Even setting aside the election, that ritual's tonight! Why, oh
why, in this tiny little town, do I have to have a father who's the mayor and a
grandmother who's the chief Shinto priestess at the shrine? I bury my face in
my knees and heave a deep, deep sigh.
"Aaagh... I wanna hurry up and graduate and go to Tokyo. This town is too
cramped and too tight!"
Saya's nodding along: I know. I totally, totally get it! "My mom and my
sisters have all been in charge of the town broadcasts, one after another. Ever
since I was tiny, the neighborhood ladies have called me 'the little broadcast
girl,' you know?! And now I'm in the broadcastin' club for some reason! Even
I don't know what I want to do anymore!"
"Saya, once we graduate, let's get out and go to Tokyo together! Even when
we're grown up, in this town, we'll still be stuck with the school hierarchy!
We'll never be free of these moldy old traditions! C'mon, Tesshi, you're
cornin' with us, right?"
"Hmm?" Absently, Tesshi looks up from his magazine.
".. .Were you even listenin'?"
"Mm. I don't really, uh... I think I'll just live here for the rest of my life."
HAAAAAAAAH. Saya and I sigh again. This is why he isn't popular with
girls... Although it's not like I've ever had a boyfriend myself.

hall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose
meaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.
We're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,
twirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.
During my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and
got even more depressed. Those little— I told them and told them not to come,
and they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text
them tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.
Sure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,
I'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's

Munch, munch, munch.
Munch.
Munch, munch, munch, munch.
I'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to
think, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing
the exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small
wooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,
a diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.
Munch, munch, munch.
Munch, munch.
Agh, I swear...
Munch, munch, munch.
I'm going to have to do it soon.
Munch, munch.
Arrrgh.
Munch.
Giving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,
attempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.
And then. Aaagh.
Puckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The
mixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I
feel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.
Please, nobody look at me.
Mouth-brewed sake.
It's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with
saliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to
the gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I
don't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first
century... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!
I mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice
and put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the
exact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over
and over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.
Inside, I'm crying my eyes out.
Abruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a
faint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.
Curses.
I want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy
"in-crowd" classmates. They're watching me with smirks on their faces and
gleefully gossiping about something. There's too much distance between us for
me to really hear them but I feel as though I'm hearing them loud and clear.
Eeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how
can she do that in public? Nobody's ever gonna marry her now.
I make a very, very firm resolution:
When I graduate, I am leaving this town and going far away.
"Cheer up, Sis. Who cares if people from your school saw you? And
anyway, what's got you so shook up?"
"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!"
I glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office
entrance.
After the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a
banquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was
the hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.
"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a
sweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. "
"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead—drink some
more!"
We entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally
turned us loose just now, saying, "You kids can go on home." Gran and the
other adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.
"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?"
On the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool
sounds of insect songs echo all around us.
"I dunno. Sixty?"
"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!"
"Huh."
"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.
They're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the
whole place!"
"Hmm..."
What I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but
Yotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,
she's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving
up, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,
shining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.
"...That's it!"
As we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha
suddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a
cake someone hid from her.
"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay
your way to Tokyo?!"
For a moment, I'm speechless.
".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that."
"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and
call it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!"
Should I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?
Still, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she
really is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before.

My wish echoes around the dark mountains, then disappears as though
drawn into Itomori Lake below me. The words came out on impulse, and
they're so dumb, my head cools right down, as does my sweat.

I reach farther. Grr, that alarm is so noisy. Where'd I put it?
Ow!"
My back hits the floor with an emphatic thud. Apparently, I've managed to
fall out of bed. Ow, ow, ow, ow... Wait, what? Bed?
I finally open my eyes and sit up.
Huh?
The room is completely unfamiliar.
And I'min it.
Did I sleep over somewhere last night?
"...Where ami?"
The moment I murmur the words, I notice a strange heaviness in my throat.
By reflex, I put a hand to it. The throat my fingers find is hard and angular.
"Hmm?" My voice slips out again, and it's really low. I look down at myself.
.. .They're gone.
A T-shirt I've never seen before falls flat all the way to my stomach, and
they're not there.
My boobs are gone.
And right in the middle of my freakishly visible lower body, there's...
something. Something asserting its presence strongly enough to overwrite the
feeling of wrongness precipitated by my missing boobs.
What is...this?
Slowly, I extend my hand, reaching for that area. All the blood in my body
and all the skin over it is being pulled toward that one spot.
...Is this, um...? L-location-wise, it's...
I touch it.
And very nearly pass out.

and his neck looks stiff. His cheeks are lean, with clean lines, and for some
reason, there's a big bandage on one of them. When I touch it gingerly, there's a
dull throb.
—But. Even though it hurts, I don't wake up. My throat is bone-dry. I twist
the faucet, fill my hands with tap water, and drink. It's unpleasantly warm and
smells like chemicals, like pool water.
"Taki, are you up?"
Abruptly, a man's voice calls from somewhere in the distance, and I give a
little shriek of alarm. Taki?
"Breakfast was your job today, kid. Remember? You overslept."
Nervously, I peek into what looks like a living room. As he speaks, a
middle-aged man in a suit glances at me, then immediately returns his attention
to the dishes.
"I-Tm sorry!"
I apologize out of habit.
"I'm heading out. There's miso soup—go ahead and finish it off."
"Um, yessir."
"And go to school. Even if you're late."
On that note, the man briskly piles up the dishes, puts them in the small
kitchen, passes by me as I stand petrified in the doorway, goes to the foyer,
dons his shoes, opens the door, steps out, and shuts it behind him. It all happens
so fast there'd have been barely enough time for a kite to call once.
".. .What a weird dream," I say out loud.
I take another look around the room. There are photos and design sketches
of bridges and buildings and structures all over the walls. The floor is a
careless mess of magazines and paper bags and cardboard boxes. Compared to
the Miyamizu house, tidy as a venerable old Japanese inn (all thanks to Gran),
this place seems wild and lawless. The room is really small—probably a
condominium. If this is my dream, I have no idea where it came from, but I'm
impressed by how real it seems. I guess I've got a pretty good imagination.
Maybe I could be some kind of artist when I grow up.
Tweedle!
A text alert echoes from the depths of the hall with such impeccable timing
that it seems like a comeback. Eep! I gasp, hastily dashing back to the room
where the bed was. The smartphone's on the floor beside the sheets, and
there's a short message on its screen.
Are you still home? Get over here, run!
Tsukasa
Huh? What? What's this? Who in the world is Tsukasa?!
At any rate, I guess I have to go to school. I scan the room. My eyes stop on
a boy's uniform hanging beside the window, and as I pick it up, I'm suddenly
aware of another emergency.
Oh, for the love of...!
I need to pee.
Haaaaaah. I heave a sigh nearly strong enough to deflate my whole body.
What is wrong with guys' bodies, anyway?!
I managed to do my business somehow, but I'm still shaking with anger. The
harder I tried to pee, and the more I tried to aim it with my fingers, the more the
thing changed shape and the harder it got to go. What's up with that?! Are they
stupid?! Are they idiots?! Or is this guy weird?! Arrrgh! I'd never even seen
one of those before! And excuse me, but I'm technically a shrine maiden!
After I change into the uniform, keeping my head bent from the awful shame
and fighting back tears (I can't actually fight them all back, and a few slip out),
I open the condo's door.

My eyes are riveted.
The view before me leaves me breathless.
I'm standing on the outside corridor of a high-rise condo that's probably on
a hill.
Below lies a generous carpet of greenery, like a large park. The sky is a
vivid cerulean blue, without the slightest blemish. On the border between the
blue and green, ranks of buildings of all sizes line up neatly, like extra-intricate
origami. Each and every one is stamped with minute, exquisite windows like
the mesh of a net. Some of the windows reflect blue, others are tinted green,
and still others simply glitter in the morning sun. I can see a red tower, tiny
with distance, and a silver building whose rounded lines remind me vaguely of
a whale, and a shining black building that looks as though it's been cut from a
block of obsidian. I'm sure these buildings and several of the others are
famous—even I recognize some of them. Far away, little toy cars flow in neat,
orderly lines.
It's the scenery of the biggest city in Japan, and compared with what I'd
imagined, it's— Actually, come to think of it, I've never really tried to
visualize what it would be like before, but it's much, much more beautiful than
it looks in the movies and on TV It hits me hard, right in the chest.
"Tokyo," I murmur.
This world is far too dazzling. I inhale deeply and squint, as if looking at
the sun.
"Hey, where'd you buy this?" "In Nishi-Azabu, on the way home from
lessons." "Guess who's gonna be opening for their next big concert?" "Yo,
wanna skip club today and go catch a movie?" "An agency employee is coming
to the mixer tonight."
Wh-what's with these conversations? Are these people actually modern
Japanese high schoolers? Maybe they're just reading posts off some celebrity's
Facebook page?
I watch the classroom from where I'm standing, half-hidden behind the
door, timing my entrance. I used my smartphone's GPS to get here, and even
then, I got incredibly lost. By the time I found the school, the lunch bell was
already chiming away.
Still, this school— Glass windows that take up entire walls, bare concrete,
colorful iron doors with round windows... It's so abnormally fancy, I have to
wonder whether it's a World Expo venue or something. This Taki Tachibana
guy, a boy my age, lives in a world like this? I think of his name, which I found
in his student handbook, and his smug expression on his ID photo. They annoy
me a little.
"Taaaki!"
Somebody abruptly throws an arm around my shoulders from behind, and I
give a wordless yelp. When I look, a bespectacled CEO-type (only neat and
sophisticated) is smiling at me, close enough that our bangs are almost
touching. Eeeeeek! 'Scuse me, mister—this is the closest I've ever been to a
guy in my life!
"Look at you, showing up at noon. Let's go eat."
With that, the kid with glasses sets off down the hall, still hugging my
shoulders. No, seriously, you're way too close!
"Ignore my text, will you?" he accuses, but he doesn't sound mad. Then I
figure it out.
".. .Excuse me... Wait, Tsukasa?"
"Ha-ha, 'excuse me'? Do I detect a note of contrition?"
I don't know how to respond to that, so for the moment, I quietly extricate
myself from his arm.
"...Yougot lost?"
Takagi—a big, good-natured guy—shouts, not bothering to hide his
astonishment.
"How the heck did you manage to get lost on the way to school?"
"Um..." I falter. The three of us are sitting in a corner of the wide rooftop.
It's supposed to be lunchtime right now, but there aren't many people around.
Maybe they're avoiding the summer sun.

"Oh, um, 'scuse me—
'"'Scuseme'?"
Takagi and Tsukasa eye each other dubiously. Oops, that's right: I'm Taki
Tachibana now.
"Uh, I mean, um... Oh. Pardon me...?"
"Hunh?"
"Sorry."
"Say what?"
".Whatever?"
Uh-huh, they nod, still looking bewildered. I see, so he's the "whatever"
type. Got it!
"I was just enjoyin' myself a little. Tokyo's kinda like a festival. Real
lively."
".. .What's with the accent?" asks Takagi.
"Huh?!" I have an accent? I turn red.
"Taki, where's your lunch?" Tsukasa prods.
"Huh?!!" I didn't bring one!
As I hunt through my school bag, sweating bullets, they laugh. "Do you have
a fever or something?"
"Tsukasa, you got anything?"
"Egg sandwich. Let's stick that croquette of yours in here."
Here. The two of them hand me the improvised egg-croquette sandwich.
Their kindness touches my heart.
"Thank you..."
They both grin at me wordlessly. To think boys could be so stylish and
kind...! No, Mitsuha, don't do it! Don't fall for both of them at once! —Well,

"To the cafe."
"C-c-cafeeeee?!"
The furrows between their eyebrows deepen, but I ignore it. My mood is
soaring, and I can't repress my excitement. This is it! Who's laughing now, bus
stop cafe?!
Two tiny dogs dressed in pop idol-style outfits are sitting on a wicker
chair, watching me with eyes like candy drops and wagging their tails so hard
they seem liable to come off. There's an incredible amount of space between
each table, and fully half the customers are foreign. A third are wearing
sunglasses, three-fifths are wearing hats, and not one is wearing a suit. There's
no telling what any of them do for a living.
What is this place? Adults go to cafes with their little dogs on weekdays, in
broad daylight?!
"I like the timberwork on the ceiling."
"Yeah. They put serious effort into that."
Tsukasa and Takagi don't seem the least bit intimidated by this supremely
trendy space. They're smiling and discussing their impressions of the interior.
Apparently, these boys are touring different cafes because they're interested in
architecture. What kind of hobby is that?! Aren't high school guys into
magazines like MU7\\
"Taki, do you know what you want?"
Prompted by Tsukasa, I stop dissecting the cafe and let my eyes fall to the
heavy, leather-bound menu.
..! I—I could live for a month on how much these pancakes cost!"
"What era are you from, again?" Takagi laughs.
"Umm..."
I stress about it for a little while and then remember: Oh. Right. This is a
dream. Well, in that case, why not? It's Taki Tachibana's money anyway. I'll
just eat whatever I want.

The place is a dauntingly ritzy Italian restaurant.
It's a two-story building that's open all the way up, atrium-style. The
ceiling is hung with sparkling chandeliers, and there are big propellers up
there, too, spinning slowly. I've seen something like them in a movie. Taki
Tachibana is a bow tie-wearing waiter, and at dinnertime, the restaurant is
hellishly busy.
I'm being swept this way and that by a muddy torrent of confusion, getting
orders wrong, serving them wrong, getting tske d at by customers and yelled at
by the chefs. Come on, people, I've never worked here before! Actually, I've
never worked a part-time job before, period! This is a total nightmare!

I've already gone a little ways past the customer who flagged me down,
and I turn back hastily. How am I supposed to know to respond to "boy," huh?
Wow. The man's an obvious thug, complete with open-collared shirt, gold
chain, and lots of clunky rings. Still, if you go to the next city over from my
town, there are a lot of guys like him hanging out in front of the station. His
type feels a little more familiar to me than the celebrity-esque luster of the
other customers. When he speaks, there's a thin smarm in his voice:
"Listen. There was a toothpick in my pizza."
"Huh?"
Mr. Thug picks up the very last slice of basil pizza with his fingertips.
There's a toothpick sticking out of the edge where it was sliced, basically
screaming that someone jabbed it in there after the fact. Maybe he's joking
around with me. I'm bewildered, unsure how to respond, and Mr. Thug
continues with a seemingly fixed smile.
"It woulda been bad if I'd eaten that, right? We're just lucky I noticed it.
What're you gonna do?"
"Huh...?"
I get the feeling I really can't afford to say, You really stuck that in there
yourself right, sir? I give a noncommittal smile instead... Conversely, his
fades.
"I'm asking you what you're gonna do about it?!"
Crash! All of a sudden, he kicks the table up with his knee and starts
yelling. Instantly, the murmur of conversation freezes. I tense up, too.
"—Sir! Is something the matter?"
A woman appears and pushes me out of the way. She glances at me and
whispers, "I've got this!"
Someone else grabs my arm from behind and drags me away—a waiter
who's probably worked there longer than me. "You're acting pretty weird
today," he says, looking concerned.
"I'm terribly sorry about that, sir!" Out of the corner of my eye, I see the
woman bowing deeply to the thug.
The background hum returns, as if someone's twisted the volume backup.
I'm pushing an industrial vacuum cleaner that's as big as a lawn mower
over the floor. The restaurant's finally closed. The lights in the chandeliers
have dimmed, and all the tables have been stripped. One employee polishes
glasses, another checks the stock in the refrigerator, and somebody else is
doing something with the computers at the cashier counter.
The woman who rescued me is wiping down the tables one by one. For a
little while now, Fve been trying—and failing—to find an opportunity to speak
to her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and
I can't read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a
gentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small—and
yet she's got big boobs. She's just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I
catch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.
Perfect!
"Miss Okudera?"
Just as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the
head.
"That's senpai to you!" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He
goes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got
seniority on me. Okay!
"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really..."
"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?"
As she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes
curve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of
beauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel
compelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look
down.
"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just..."
"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let
him have his food for free, but..."
She doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping
down another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...
"Eek! Okudera-senpai!"
Another waitress cries out.
"Your skirt!"
"Hmm?"
Miss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now
that I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a
shocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.
"Are you hurt?"
"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?"
"I think something like that's happened before..."
"Was someone harassing you?"
"Do you remember the guy's face?"
Several staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.
Eyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the
words I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I
see little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.
This time, I need to rescue her.
The thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,
I've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my
back ("Hey! Taki, you little..."), but I ignore them.
The green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at
least one more design element. The brown is— Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The
cream is for its nose.
Pinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For
some reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing
room sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate
repair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly
good at.
"All done!"
I hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to
finish.
"...Huh? This is..."
The dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing
room quickly shifts to surprise.
"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!"
The tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so
as I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.
The skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought
being a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like
Okudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but
when she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the
neighborhood.
"You really saved me today. Thank you very much."
I finally managed to say it.
"Heh-heh!" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.
"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but
you're always so quick to fight."
As she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I
grasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.
"I like this version of you better," Okudera-senpai says, a bit
mischievously. "You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki."
My heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It
makes me want to give her everything I have for free. I think it's the most
precious thing I've seen in Tokyo today.`,length:6779,num_lines:119,location:"Generic Locations",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Confrontation",role:"A thug confronts the protagonist about a toothpick in his pizza, escalating tension.",importance:.9,emotion:"tense and anxious",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I'm asking you what you're gonna do about it?!",importance_rank:1},{name:"Rescue",role:"Okudera-senpai intervenes to help the protagonist during the confrontation.",importance:.8,emotion:"relief and gratitude",sentiment:.6,quote:"I've got this!",importance_rank:3},{name:"Support",role:"The protagonist supports Okudera-senpai by fixing her skirt after an incident.",importance:.7,emotion:"caring and affectionate",sentiment:.8,quote:"All done!",importance_rank:4},{name:"Admiration",role:"The protagonist admires Okudera-senpai's beauty and demeanor throughout the scene.",importance:.9,emotion:"infatuation and awe",sentiment:.9,quote:"Her smile is absolutely unbeatable.",importance_rank:2}],number:6,importance_rank:8,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Reflections on Tokyo",summary:"The protagonist reflects on their experiences in Tokyo.",chapter:"Chapter Three Days",first_line:375,last_line:436,text:`The yellow train I take to get home is empty.
By now, I've realized that Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.
Convenience stores, family restaurants, the people I pass, the edge of the park,
construction sites, the station at night, the inside of the train... Almost every ten
steps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced
smells when gathered in one place.
And for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person
living in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that
stretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the
overwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.
Taki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand
toward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but
I guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,
as if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know
"Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself."
Back at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this
morning.
I'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1
had! Isn't that amazin '? Aren't you awed by my fantastic imagination?! It s
like I actually went to Tokyo! I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist—or no, wait,
I'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll
probably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?
Fantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick
up Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my
fingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary
[9/7 Ate at KFC with Tsukasa and Co.] [9/6
Movie in Hibiya] [8/31 Architecture Tour—
Bayside Edition] [8/25 Payday!]
As I scroll backward through the headers, I'm impressed in spite of myself.
"He's real thorough." Then I tap the photo app. Most of the pictures are
landscapes. After those, the majority are of him with Tsukasa and Takagi.
Eating ramen together, going to the park together... They sure are close. A beet
bowl place, a soba shop at the station, a trendy hamburger joint. The road
home from school. Sunset through the gaps between the buildings. His friends'
backs. Jet contrails in the sky overhead.
"Lucky him, livin' in Tokyo..."
As I murmur, a yawn slips out. Starting to get sleepy, I go to the next photo.
"Oh, it's Okudera-senpai."
The picture is of her back as she's cleaning the restaurant window, and it
feels like a candid shot. In the next, she's noticed and turned to face the
camera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.
...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It's bound to be
unrequited, though. She's in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.
I sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in
everything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but
connected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from
work, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in
the entry, wanting to report it—or brag about it—to Taki Tachibana. Once I'm
done, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...
Who are you?
For some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.
Vaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room
in Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something
oddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the
palm of my hand, I write:
Mitsuha
Yaaaawwn...
That's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,
thrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored
shower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to
finish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the
writing on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.`,length:3970,num_lines:62,location:"Tokyo",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Self-reflection",role:"The protagonist reflects on their identity through Taki's experiences.",importance:.9,emotion:"curiosity and connection",sentiment:.5,quote:"Who are you?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Urban Life",role:"The scene captures the essence of living in a bustling city.",importance:.8,emotion:"awe and wonder",sentiment:.7,quote:"Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Dreams And Reality",role:"The protagonist fantasizes about their future and creativity.",importance:.8,emotion:"hopeful and excited",sentiment:.6,quote:"I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Search For Connection",role:"The protagonist feels a bond with Taki despite not knowing him well.",importance:.7,emotion:"affection and kinship",sentiment:.5,quote:"I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy.",importance_rank:4}],number:7,importance_rank:9,conflict_rank:13},{title:"The Switch",summary:"The protagonist realizes they are switching bodies with Mitsuha.",chapter:"Chapter Three Days",first_line:437,last_line:586,text:`+ + +
"...What is this?"
I say the words aloud, despite myself. I'm staring at my hand.
Finally, I let my eyes drop from the letters on my palm down to my
wrinkled uniform and necktie... So, what—I fell asleep without changing?
"—Wh.. .wh-what is this?!"
This time, I actually yell. We're having breakfast, and my dad glances at me
but promptly loses interest and returns his attention to his bowl. I stare at my
phone, stunned. There's a really long journal entry on it that I don't remember
writing.
...And on the way home from work, Okudera-
senpai and I walked to the station together, just
the two of us! It's all because I'm in touch with
my feminine side.
"Taki, want to hit another cafe today?"
"Uh, sorry, I've got work after this."
"Ha-ha. You know where to go?"
"Huh? .. .Hey! Tsukasa, you jerk, was that you?"
I raise my voice without meaning to. Actually, I wish it was him. Tsukasa's
puzzled expression tells me it wasn't, though. Even I know there's no reason
somebody'd go to all that trouble for a prank.
Getting up from my chair, I reluctantly excuse myself:
".. .Nah, never mind. See ya."
As I leave the classroom, I hear Takagi's voice behind me. Dude's back to
normal today.
An uneasy shiver shoots through me, and my feet get cold. Something very
weird is happening to me.
"...Wh-what?"
After I change into my work clothes, three of my senior coworkers are
standing outside the changing room when I open the door, blocking my way.
There's one regular staffer and two college part-timers, all guys, and they're
glaring at me with eyes that look bloodshot or maybe teary... Either way, not
good. I swallow hard, and the three of them start in on me in menacing tones.
"Taki, you scumbag, whaddaya think you're doing, getting a jump on us?"
"You'd better have an excuse, weasel." "You two left together yesterday,
didn't you?"
"Huh... Wait, no way—seriously?! I did? With Okudera-senpai?!"
Meaning that journal entry was real?!
"What happened with you two after that?!"
"Uh, no, I.. .1 really don't remember much..."
"Don't gimme that crap!"
Just as it looks like somebody's gonna haul me up by my shirtfront, a cool
voice echoes through the hall.
"Okudera, reporting for duty."
Okudera-senpai arrives, her long, bare legs and the shoulders peeking out
of her top gleaming in the light. She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals
clicking pleasantly.
"Hello, everyone."
"Hi!"
She's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning
presence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about
our problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.
"Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?"
I can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly
delivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the
door. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.
This is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until
they shine, right this minute.
".Hey. Taki."
The guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the
depths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.
—Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I
wonder:
What's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...
Nah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?
What the heck is "Mitsuha "?
The birds are energetically twittering away again this morning. There's a
newborn clarity to the early sun that streams in through the paper sliding doors,
and the morning is peaceful, as usual. Even so, although I've just woken up,
unfamiliar writing with a quality of pure, concentrated irritation is scrawled
across my arm.
Mitsuha??? What are you? Who are you????
The letters are big and messy, written roughly with a super-thick Magic
Marker, from my palm all the way up to my elbow.
"Sis, what is that?"
When I look up, Yotsuha's standing in the open sliding door. I make a face
that says, That's what I want to know.
My little sister's face replies, Well, it doesn't really matter.
"You're not feelin' up your boobs today, huh? Break! Fast! Time! Hurry
up!"
She shuts the sliding door with a sharp clack , just like always, and I watch
her from my futon. Huh? Boobs? I'm "not feeling them up today"? ...Excuse
me? My mind produces a gratuitous image of myself happily squeezing my own
boobs... B-but that's so perverted and gross!
"Mornin'!" I say as I enter the classroom.
The minute I do, all my classmates' eyes are on me. Eep! I give a little
gasp. Wh-what? Trying to make myself small and inconspicuous, I cross to my
seat by the window. I hear whispers.
"Miyamizuwas really cool yesterday, huh."
"Uh-huh. I didn't think she had it in her."
"Her personality's kinda changed, though, yeah?"
"U-um, people are lookin' at me..."
"Well, what did you expect? After what you pulled yesterday, they can't
help it," says Saya.
"'What I pulled yesterday'?" I ask, sitting down.
Saya peers into my face, looking puzzled and worried.
—You know.. .durin' art yesterday, when we were sketchin' that still life.
Huh? You really don't remember? Again? Honestly, Mitsuha, are you okay?
You and me were in the same group. We were supposed to be drawin' the vase
and the apples—y'know, the subject that doesn't make any sense. Except you
sketched a landscape instead. Well, that bit doesn't matter. Anyway,
Matsumoto's group was behind us, and they were talkin' nasty, the way they
always do.
What, you want to know? Um, well, about the mayoral election.
Huh? Details? Oh, you know, how the town administration is all just
figurin' out how to hand out subsidies, and it's the same no matter who does it,
but how there are "some kids" whose livelihood depends on it, et cetera.
Dumb stuff like that. When you heard them, you said, "That's me they're talkin'
about, right?" So I said I thought it probably was. I mean, if you ask me, I'm
gonna answer, right? Then, Mitsuha, what do you suppose you did?
You seriously don't remember? You kicked the desk with the vase on it
right toward Matsumoto's group! And with a great big grin on your face!
Matsumoto and the others got scared, and of course, the vase broke, and the
whole class went dead quiet. Actually, you gave me the chills, too!
"Wh-wh-what in the world?"
I turn pale. After school, I run straight home. Yotsuha and Gran are in the
living room, drinking tea without a care in the world. Glancing at them out of
the corner of my eye, I run up the stairs, shut myself in my room, and open my
classics notebook. Who are you? it still reads. I turn a few more pages.
My skin crawls. Now there's a whole two pages filled with small letters in
the same handwriting. First, in big letters, Mitsuha Miyamizu. Then there are
lots of question marks around it and bits of personal information about me.
Year 2, Class 3 / Teshigawara friend, occult geek,

maiden? / Sounds like her mom is dead / Her dad

Then, in larger letters, What the heck is this life??
I stare at the notebook. I'm trembling. The scenery of Tokyo shimmers in my
mind, as faint as a rising haze. Cafes, a part-time job, guy friends, walking
home with someone...
A corner of my heart catches the tail of an impossible conclusion.
"Is this...? Could we be...?"
"Is this seriously...?"
I'm holed up in my room, staring at my phone in denial. For a while now,
my fingers have been shaking as if they partly belong to somebody else as I
scroll through the entries in my journal app. Sandwiched between the ones I
wrote, there are several headers I don't remember.

The sun rises from the edge of the mountains. Little by little, the daylight
washes over the lake town. The birds in the morning, the hush at midday, the
insect songs in the evening, the glitter of the night sky.
The sun rises between the buildings. Little by little, the daylight glints oft
countless windows. The throngs of people in the morning, the hum of midday,
the scents of everyday life at half-light, the sparkle of the streets at night.
Over and over, we're captivated by moments like these.
And, gradually, we learn.
Taki Tachibana—Taki—is a high school kid my age who lives in Tokyo,
and...
At irregular intervals, unexpectedly, two or three times a week, I swap
bodies with Mitsuha Miyamizu, who lives way out in the sticks. It triggers
when we fall asleep. We have no idea what causes it.
Our memories of the time we spend switched fade as soon as we wake up.
It feels like a lucid dream.
Even so, we're definitely swapping. The reactions of the people around us
prove it more than anything.
Now that we're aware that we are actually switching with each other,
we're starting to hold on to bits of memories from the dreams. For example, at
this point, even when I'm awake, I know there's a boy named Taki who lives in
Tokyo.
Now I'm positive there's a girl named Mitsuha living in a country town
somewhere. I don't have any solid evidence or rational explanation, but I have
this strange sense that tells me it's real.
We've also started communicating with each other. On the days when we
switch, we leave diary entries or notes on each other's smartphones.
We've tried texting and calling, too, but for some reason, neither of us
could get through. Anyway, we're lucky we figured out a way to communicate
at all. We both need to keep each other's lives intact and undisturbed... So we
set rules.
<To Taki—Don'ts List #1>
• Absolutely no baths, ever.
• Do not look at or touch my body.
• When you sit, keep your legs together.
• Don't get too friendly with Tesshi. Try to get
him and Saya together.
• Don't touch other boys.
• Don't touch the girls, either.
<To Mitsuha—Don'ts List Ver. 5>
• I told you before, don't waste my money.
Remember?
• Don't be late for school or work. Learn how to
get there already.
• Don't talk with an accent.
• Are you sneaking baths? I think I smell
shampoo...
• Don't get cuddly with Tsukasa, you idiot.
People will get the wrong idea.
• Don't get too friendly with Okudera-senpai, I'm
begging you.
—But still... I grit my teeth reading another of Mitsuha's journal entries.
Reading Taki's entry in my diary, my blood starts to boil. Honestly, I swear,
this is just completely...

is such a...!

and had tea! I tried to buy hers for her, but she
paid for mine instead. "Take me out when you
graduate from high school," she said! Can you
believe that? "That's a promise," I told her, all
cool-like. Your relationship is blossoming, so,
you're welcome.

That's Mitsuha's ringtone.
Meaning, I'm living in the country today, I think sleepily. Awesome. I'll
get to put in some more time on the cafe project I'm working on with
Teshigawara after school. Yeah, and also—
I sit up on the futon and look down at my body.
Mitsuha's pajamas have gotten really conservative lately. She used to sleep
in a baggy nightshirt without a bra. This morning, though, she's wearing
underwear that's kinda constricting and this shirt that's buttoned up all the way.
There's no telling when we're gonna swap, so she's being careful. Well, I get
that. I do. But.
I reach for her breasts. This is my body today. Nothing wrong with
touching my own body, I think, just like always. Only. Except. But...
My hands pause, and I mutter quietly:
".. .Guess I shouldn't."
The sliding door rattles open.
".You really do like your boobs, don't you. Sis?"
That's all the little sister says before closing the sliding door. I watch her
go.. .while kneading my breasts.
.. .This is okay, right? From on top of her clothes. Just a little.
"Graaaaan. Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?"
Yotsuha whines.
Gran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.
"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either."
Mayugorou?
".. .Who's that?" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.
"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous."
Famous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.
The three Miyamizu women—me, the grandma, and Yotsuha—have been
hiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're
taking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.
These people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.
The sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.
The air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the
pleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in
this town now.
Come to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.
The thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this
mountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong
walker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've
never lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what
kind of shape she's in.
"Hey, Grandma!"
I break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this
little old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really
good lunches.
"Let me piggyback you. If you want..."
"Oh, may I?" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto
my back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at
somebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,
warm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs
nothing.
"Grandma, you're way light— Whoa!"
The moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.
Yotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, "Come on, Sis!" Come to think of it,
Mitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the
world this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.
"Mitsuha, Yotsuha."
I hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.
"Are you familiar with musubiT '
" MusubiT '
Yotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to
her stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole
round lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from
climbing with her grandma on her back.
"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of
spirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's."
Guardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old
lady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and
it's oddly persuasive.
"Did you know?" she starts again. "Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'
people is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the
same word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the
braided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself."
I can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I
think.
"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'
undone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's
musubi ."
Without really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up
against rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a
whole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,
but I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I
wake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,
falling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry
mountain.
"Here, drink up."
We take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.
It's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,
and I drain two cups in a row. "C'mon! Me too!" Yotsuha pesters. This may be
the best drink I've ever had.
"That's another musubi."
"Huh?"
As I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.
She's sitting at the base of a tree.
"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
called musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your
soul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition
meant to connect the god and humans to each other, a custom that the Miyamizu
family has observed for centuries."
Before I notice, the trees end, and the lake town below us—now about the
size of a sketchbook—is half-hidden beneath the clouds. When I look up, the
wisps of cloud still overhead seem paper-thin, transparent and shining.
They're flowing rapidly into the distance and dissolving in the strong wind.
We're in a rocky area where only moss grows. We've finally reached the peak.
"I see it, I see it!"
Yotsuha's skipping around. I catch up to her and follow her gaze. Ahead,
there's a crater-like basin about the size of an athletic field, as if the top of the
mountain has been gouged out. The inside is a green, marshy area, and near its
center stands a massive, solitary tree.
I'd never even imagined a view like this one, and I stare.
It's almost like a natural floating garden. You'd never be able to see it from
the town. The boondocks are all kinds of awesome.
"This is the edge of the other side," the old lady says.
We've gone down to the basin floor, and there's a little brook flowing in
front of us. The big tree is beyond.
"Other side?" Yotsuha and I say together.
"The hidden world, the next world."
The next world. Grandma's folktale voice strokes my back like a cold
wind. My feet falter just a little. A sacred mountain, or a power spot, or a save
point—whatever it is, the atmosphere saturating it really does seem to belong
to some other world.
This better not be one of those places that doesn't let you leave once you go
in.
"Yaaaay, it's the next world!"
Yotsuha whoops and splashes across the little stream. Kids are really
something, all dumb and full of energy. Well, the weather's nice, and the wind
and the brook are both peaceful. I'd probably be embarrassed later if I got cold
feet over something like this. I take the old lady's hand so she won't get wet,
and we cross the brook on the stepping-stones.
"In order to return to our world...," the old lady begins, suddenly sounding
solemn, "you two must leave behind what's most precious to you."
"Huh?!" In spite of myself, my voice gets shrill.
"W-wait, Grandma—don't say that after we're already here!"
The old woman smiles at my protest, and her eyes squinch up. I can see the
gaps where she's missing teeth, and it's really creepy.
"There's nothin' to fear. I meant the sake. Take it out," the old lady instructs,
and both Yotsuha and I remove small urns from our backpacks. They're the
kind of thing you tend to see on Shinto altars in people's houses. Made of
glossy white ceramic, their rounded shapes are a few inches across, and they
widen into a pedestal at the base. The lids are sealed with braided cords, and I
can hear liquid splashing inside.
"Below the god's body," Grandma says, gazing at the enormous tree,

I look at the urn in my hands. It's that special sake, the stuff she made by
chewing up rice. This sake was made by "binding" rice and this body... And
I'm the one offering it. Feeling awkward—like I'm about to score a goal off a
pass from someone I've been fighting with—but at the same time strangely
proud, I start toward the great tree.

There's a loud rustling, and a flock of sparrows bursts out of the brush right
in front of me. Having been under the impression that birds just hung out in
trees, I'm startled, but Yotsuha runs after them, twirling around and around. She
looks like she's having fun. We must be pretty close to the town—there are
faint dinnertime smells on the wind. The idea that it's possible to so clearly
distinguish the scents of everyday human life surprises me a little.
"It's already half-light."
Having completed the day's formal business, Yotsuha sounds relieved, like
she's finally finished her homework. The evening sun lights up the girl and the
old lady sidelong, like a spotlight. It's almost too picture-perfect.
"Whoa...!"
The sight of the village coming into view below us makes me exhale
despite myself. I can see Mitsuha's entire town around the edge of the lake.
Blue shadows have already engulfed the town itself, but the lake yawning
beside reflects the red sky. On the hillsides here and there, pink evening mists
are gathering. Dinner smoke rises from several houses, trailing high and thin,
like smoke signals. The sparrows skimming through the air over the town
gleam randomly, like motes of dust after school.
"Think we'll be able to see the comet soon?"
Yotsuha is searching the sky, blocking out the setting sun with her palm.
"Comet?"
Now that she mentions it, I remember they were talking about something
like that on TV during breakfast, about how the comet's been close enough to
be visible to the naked eye for a few days now and how, just after sunset today,
we'd probably be able to see it if we looked diagonally above Venus.`,length:1750,num_lines:27,location:"Generic Locations",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Nature's Beauty",role:"Highlights the picturesque scenery",importance:.9,emotion:"Awe and wonder",sentiment:1,quote:"The sight of the village coming into view below us makes me exhale despite myself.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Childlike Joy",role:"Yotsuha's playful spirit",importance:.7,emotion:"Happiness and freedom",sentiment:1,quote:"Yotsuha runs after them, twirling around and around.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Transition",role:"Signifies the end of the day",importance:.6,emotion:"Calm and reflective",sentiment:.5,quote:"It's already half-light.",importance_rank:5},{name:"Search For Connection",role:"Evokes feelings of nostalgia",importance:.8,emotion:"Warmth and familiarity",sentiment:.8,quote:"Dinner smoke rises from several houses, trailing high and thin.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Anticipation",role:"Builds excitement for the comet",importance:.7,emotion:"Curiosity and eagerness",sentiment:.6,quote:"Think we'll be able to see the comet soon?",importance_rank:4}],number:12,importance_rank:13,conflict_rank:15},{title:"Waking Up Again",summary:"Mitsuha wakes up to a new day with confusion.",chapter:"Chapter Three Days",first_line:872,last_line:910,text:`"The comet..."
I say it aloud one more time. Out of nowhere, I feel as if I've forgotten
something.
I narrow my eyes, searching the western sky, and find what I'm looking for
right away. Above Venus, which is especially bright, I see the comet's shining
blue tail. In the depths of my memory, something's trying to surface.
That's right. Once before, I...
That comet—
".. .My, my. Mitsuha."
Before I know she's there, Grandma's peering up at me—into me. My
shadow is reflected at the bottom of her deep black eyes.
"You're dreamin', aren't you?"
!
All of a sudden...
I wake up.
I've flung the sheet away, and it falls off the bed without a sound. My
heart's pounding hard enough to raise my ribs (at least I think it is), but I can't
hear my heartbeat. That's weird— But just after the thought forms, little by
little, I start hearing my blood pumping. The morning sparrows outside the
window, car engines, the rumble of trains. As if I'm finally remembering
where I am, my ears begin taking in Tokyo.
"...Tears?"
I touch my cheek and find droplets of water on my fingertips.
Why? I don't know. I wipe my eyes with my palm. Even as I do, the twilight
landscape from a moment ago and the old lady's words are disappearing, like
water soaking into sand.
Tweedle.
By my pillow, my phone chirps.
I'm almost there. I'm looking forward to today, r;
It's a Line message from Okudera-senpai.
Almost here? What's she talking about? .. .And then I gasp.
"Wait, did Mitsuha—? Not again!" Panicked, I dive into my phone and read
Mitsuha's memo. "Adate?!"
I bolt out of bed and get ready at top speed.
Date with Okudera-senpai in Roppongi
tomorrow! She'll be waiting in front of Yotsuya
Station at 10:30. It's a date I want to go on, but

I sprint flat out and
arrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to
make sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend
morning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.
I wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter "Mitsuha,
you idiot" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.
...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,
this is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,
or an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.
Mitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places
with me!
"Taaaki!"
"Waugh!"
A voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I
turn around.
"Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?"
"No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no..."
What's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,
and if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,
what's the right answer?
"Urn, I, er..."
Flustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.
My eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a
black off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and
legs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed
strategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a
large mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.
She looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.
"...I just got here."
"Oh, good!" she laughs, sounding chipper.
"Shall we?"
She takes my arm... Ah, for a moment—just a moment—your breast
touched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in
this town.
"The conversation keeps dying..."
In the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it
against the mirror.
Three hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever
been in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope
that's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation
unprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too
pretty.
I mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.
Then they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're
thinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,
anyway.
Well, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I
want to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.
Consequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can
tell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely
uncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.
Dammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!
Hoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.
...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.
And so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked
links, just for you!
"Whoa, seriously?!"
Look at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them
for dear life.
Link 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a
communication disorder
Link 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever
been the tiniest bit popular!
Link 3: \\bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on
texts they'll love
.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.
Walking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.
I'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled
Nostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-
senpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.
Furano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is
divided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't
know the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can
make out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's
summer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem
oddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you
go. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. "Shibuya
and Ikebukuro," for example, or "Akasaka and Kichijouji," or "Meguro and
Tachikawa."
Even so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.
This one is different from the others.
Well, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place—the contours
of the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red
shrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick
out your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I
never actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations
when I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful
sense of deja vu about the place. This is—
"Taki?"
When I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a
second, I forgot she existed.
"You know, Taki," she says with an even smile, "you seem like a different
person today."
She executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me
behind.
I blew it.
All I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole
thing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even
consider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.
Even though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I
should've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've
spent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.
From the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi
buildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.
My eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.
Her hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,
she might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat
tighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I
grope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.
"Um, Okudera-senpai?"
She doesn't turn.
".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere—"
"Why don't we call it a day instead?" she suggests with the tone of a patient
teacher.
"Okay."
On the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-
senpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun
—I can't see it clearly.
"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?"
"Sure."
"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?"
"Huh?!" She knew?! How?!
"And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?"
"Huuuuuuuh?!" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical
rain forest. "N-no, there isn't!"
"Really?"
"Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!"
"I wonder..."
Okudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,
there's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long
hair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost
immediately.
"Well, never mind."
Her tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.
"Huh?"
"Thank you for today. I'll see you at work."
Okudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me
behind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no
words come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends
from the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.
I gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of
summer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,
and after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on
a real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's
disappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it
the entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.
It feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of
anything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming
Mitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,
we're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound
together the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think
I'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.
"That's why you're not popular, you know. " "It's your fault for promising
stuff without checking first. "
I open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.
The comet should be visible just about the time
the date ends.
Eeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.

"What's she talking about?" I mutter quietly.
If a comet people could actually see was passing, it would've been pretty
big news. Maybe Mitsuha got mixed up.
Abruptly, my heart twinges uneasily in its darkest recesses.
Something's trying to surface in my mind.
I flip through the phone and pull up Mitsuha's cell number, staring at those
eleven digits. Back when we first started swapping, I tried calling this number
several times, but for some reason, it never went through. I touch it with a
fingertip. The "calling" sound plays. Then I hear a voice from the speaker:
"The number you have dialed is unavailable. Either the number is not in
service or the unit is turned off or out of range... "
I pull the phone away from my ear and press end call.
So calls really don't get through. Well, whatever. I'll just tell her about this
train wreck of a day next time we swap. I'll ask her about the comet, too. We'll
switch tomorrow or the day after, anyway. With that thought, I finally descend
the pedestrian bridge. There's a pale, smooth half-moon overhead, all alone, as
if someone forgot it there.

Carbon particles blend into the paper fibers, lines accumulate, and the
once-white sketchbook grows darker and darker. Even so, I haven't managed
to completely capture the sights in my memory.
Every morning, I take the train to school during the commuter rush. I sit
through boring classes. I eat lunch with Tsukasa and Takagi. I walk through
town, looking up at the sky. Somewhere along the way, its blue has grown a
little deeper. Bit by bit, the trees lining the streets begin to change color.
In my room at night, I draw. On my desk, there's a stack of mountain
guidebooks I borrowed from the library. I search the ranges of Hida on my
smartphone. I look for ridgelines that match the ones I remember. I keep my
pencil in motion, trying to copy them down onto paper somehow.
Some days, rain falls, smelling like asphalt. Some days shine with
billowing clouds reminiscent of sheep. Some days, strong winds blow,
peppering Tokyo with yellow sand. Every morning, I ride crowded trains to
school. I go to my part-time job. Sometimes, Okudera-senpai and I work the
same shift. I do my best to look her in the eye, to smile properly, to talk
normally. I think, very firmly, that I want to be fair to everyone.
Some nights are still as hot and humid as midsummer, while others are
chilly enough that I wear my track jacket. No matter the temperature, when I'm
drawing, I get so hot it feels like I have a blanket wrapped around my head.
Sweat plops audibly onto my sketchbook. It blurs the lines I've drawn. Even
so, the sights of the town I saw as Mitsuha are taking shape, coming together,
bit by bit.
On the way home from school, on the way home from work, I skip the train
and take long walks. The scenery of Tokyo changes by the day. Before I know
it, there are rows of enormous cranes in Shinjuku and the Outer Garden area
around Meiji Shrine and Yotsuya, at the foot of the Benkei Bridge and partway
up Anchinzaka Hill. Little by little, steel frames and glass stretch up toward the
sky. Beyond them, there's a blank, waning half-moon.
Finally, I finish several drawings of the lake town.
This weekend, I'll head out.
Having made that resolution, I feel the tension drain from my stiff body for
the first time in a long while. Even standing up seems like too much work, so I

deep hood. I wind my lucky friendship bracelet around my wrist as usual, then
leave the condo.
It's earlier than I generally leave for school, so the train's empty, although
Tokyo Station is still teeming with people. I line up after some foreigners with
wheeled suitcases, buy a Shinkansen ticket to Nagoya from the automatic ticket
machine, and head for the Tokaido Shinkansen turnstile.
I don't believe my eyes.
"Wha...? Why are you here?!"
Okudera-senpai and Tsukasa are standing together beside a pillar right in
front of me. Okudera-senpai grins.
"Eh-heh-heh. Well, here I am!"
.. .Well, here you are? What are you, the heroine of some cutesy anime?!
I glare at Tsukasa. He looks back at me, his expression bland as if to say, Is
there a problem?
"Tsukasa, you jerk! I asked you to give me an alibi for my dad and to cover
my shift at work, remember?!"
I berate Tsukasa, who's in the seat next to mine, under my breath. Almost
all the unreserved seats on the bullet train are filled with businessmen in suits.
"Takagi's covering for you at work," he says smoothly, displaying his
phone.
"Leave it to me!" Takagi flashes a breezy thumbs-up in the video. "Buy me
a meal, though. "
"Every single friggm' one of you...," I mutter sourly.
Asking Tsukasa was a mistake. I was planning to skip school today and
spend the weekend—Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—in Hida. I went to Tsukasa
yesterday and begged him for help, telling him that something had come up and
I absolutely had to go see a friend, asking him to not ask questions and just let
me use him as an excuse while I was gone.
"I came because I was worried about you," Tsukasa says without a hint of
penitence. "I couldn't just leave you alone, could I? What are you gonna do if it
turns out to be a badger game?"
"A badger what?"
What's he talking about? My eyebrows knit, and Okudera-senpai, who's
sitting on Tsukasa's opposite side, leans in.
"You're going to see a friend you met online, aren't you, Taki?"
"Huh? No, the online thing was just an excuse, and, uh..." Yesterday,
Tsukasa was really persistent about asking who I was visiting, so I vagued
things up and told him it was somebody I'd met on a social networking site.
Tsukasa gravely informs Okudera-senpai, "Frankly, I suspect it's a dating
site."
I nearly do a spit take.
"It is not!"
"You've seemed really off lately, you know." Fooking concerned, Tsukasa
extends a box of Pocky to me. "We'll hang back and watch from a distance."
"What ami, a grade-schooler?!" I demand, lashing out.
Okudera-senpai watches me knowingly. She's absolutely got the wrong
idea about this, too.

loudspeaker.
The exchanges with Mitsuha started out of the blue one day and ended just
as suddenly. No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn't figure out why.
After several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have
been a string of extremely vivid dreams.
I've got proof, though. I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on
my phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could
never have happened if I'd been myself. I'm convinced Mitsuha's a real girl.
Her body heat, her pulse, the way she breathes, her voice, the red light
dawning over her closed eyes, the vibrant sounds in her ears—I felt all of that
myself. Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't
alive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.
Because of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.
Something might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.
Maybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I'm overthinking things, at the
very least, she's bound to be worried about the situation, too. That's why I
decided to go see her in person. But...
. .Excuse me? You don't actually know where she is?"
We're in a four-person box seat on the express train Hida. Okudera-senpai
sounds incredulous, stuffing her face with a box lunch she picked up at the
station.
"...Right."
"Your only clue is what the town looks like? You can't even contact this
girl? Are you kidding me?!"
I didn't ask her to come with me. How come I'm getting blamed? I look at
Tsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso
cutlet.
"You are an abysmal tour planner."
"This isn't a tour!"
I lose it for a second. These two think they're on some kind of field trip. I
can read their expressions clearly. There's just no help for this child. Why are
they acting all superior, anyway?
"Well, never mind," Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,
throwing out her chest. "Don't you worry, Taki. We'll help you look."
"Eeeee, it's so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!"
At the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes
over the area's laid-back mascot. It's a full-body plush cow costume wearing a
station employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click
in the little terminal.
"You guys are in the way."
As I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced
that these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her
myself.
The plan goes like this:
Since I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to
a spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll
have to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing
the drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working
our way north along the local line.

It's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a
"plan" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that
many towns built around lakes. I'm convinced I'll probably find some kind of
hint by tonight, though I've got no grounds for thinking that.
Psyching myself up, I take a confident first step, heading out to talk to the
driver of the lone taxi parked outside the station.
".. .This isn't gonna work..."
I'm slumped at a bus stop, my head drooping.
All the confidence I had when we started asking around has completely
caved.
After that first taxi driver gave me a blunt "N-nope, dunno," we tried police
boxes, convenience stores, souvenir shops, guest houses, diners, and everyone
from farmers to grade-school kids, oblivious to how we probably looked, but
our results were solidly negative. The fact that there was only one local train
every two hours made it hard for us to get around, so we thought we'd try
asking people on the bus. We boarded in high spirits but were the only
passengers. I didn't even feel like asking the driver at that point, and the last
stop was way out in the middle of nowhere, with no houses anywhere in sight.
The whole time, Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai cheerfully made the most of their
day trip, playing word games, cards, phone games, variations on rock-paper-
scissors, and eating snacks. Eventually, they ended up on either side of me on
the bus, leaning against my shoulders and dozing peacefully.
Now, as the two of them guzzle cola in front of the bus stop, I sigh. They
hear it and react together.
"Oh, come on, Taki! You're giving up already?!"
"What about all our hard work?!"
I heave another sigh, so deep it almost brings my lungs up with it. Okudera-
senpai's wearing oddly gung-ho clothes meant for serious hiking. In contrast,
Tsukasa's in chinos like he's just strolling around the neighborhood. At this
point, both outfits really irritate me.

"One Takayama ramen here."
"Uh, okay, then I'll have the same, too."
"You betcha. Three ramen!" says the middle-aged lady cheerily.
On our fruitless way to the next (abnormally distant) station, we found a
ramen shop that was miraculously open and made a beeline inside. When the
lady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, "C'mon in," her smile seemed a
beacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're
lost.
The ramen's good, too. Contrary to its name, it's perfectly ordinary ramen
(I thought it might have Hi da beef on top, but it was regular braised pork), but
as soon as I eat the noodles and veggies, I can feel my body recharging. After
draining the soup bowl dry and drinking two cups of water, I finally take a
breather.
"Do you think we'll be able to get back to Tokyo today?" I ask Tsukasa.
"Hmm... I don't know. We may be cutting it close. Want me to check?"
Tsukasa apparently didn't expect this but nevertheless pulls out his phone
and starts looking up how to get home.
"Thanks," I tell him.
"Taki, you're sure that's all right?" Okudera-senpai asks.
She's across the table from me and hasn't finished eating yet. I'm not
immediately sure how to answer, so I look out the window. The sun's just
barely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields
along the prefectural highway.
"I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track," I
mutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my
strategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town
with sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how
it starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely
ordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered

from me. "This is a real good picture. Hon, c'mere a sec!"
The woman shouts back toward the kitchen. The three of us watch her,
mouths agape.
The ramen shop owner comes out of the kitchen and considers the sketch,
smiling a little. "Oh, yeah. That was Itomori, for sure. Takes me back..."
"My man's from Itomori, you see."
Itomori?
Suddenly, I remember. I start up out of my chair.
"Itomori... Yeah, Itomori! Of course, why couldn't I remember that? It's
Itomori! It's near here, isn't it?!"
The couple looks mystified, exchanging perplexed glances. The man opens
his mouth.
"Kid... You know about Itomori, don't you? That's where—"
Tsukasa interrupts loudly. "Itomori?! Taki, don't tell me—"
"What, wait—? You mean, the one where the comet...?!"
Even Okudera-senpai speaks up, eyes wide.
"Huh.?"
I don't understand what's going on and look around at the others. They're
all watching me dubiously. The shadow of something that's been trying to
surface in my mind this whole time rustles stealthily, growing more and more
ominous.
The cry of a kite trails through the atmosphere, lonely enough to freeze the
blood.

throwing long shadows over the cracked asphalt.
A sign with vines tangled around it reads, In accordance with the

I tear my eyes away from the ruins below me, scanning my surroundings.
"It isn't just the town. I remember this schoolyard, the mountains around us,
the high school... I remember all of it perfectly!"
I have to shout the words to convince myself. Behind us is the school
building, black and sooty, with some of its windows broken. We're standing on
the grounds of Itomori High School, looking out across the lake.
"So you're saying this is the town you were looking for? The one where
your friend online lives?" Tsukasa shouts, that parched smile still clinging to
his voice.
"That's not even possible! That disaster was three years ago. Hundreds of
people died! You remember it, right, Taki?!"
At that, I finally turn toward Tsukasa.
"...Died?"
I meant to look at his face, but my gaze goes right through him, then through
the high school behind him, only to dissipate into the distance. I know I must be
looking at something, but there's nothing there.
"Three years ago...she died?"
Abruptly, I remember.
The comet I saw over Tokyo three years earlier. Countless shooting stars
falling through the western sky. I thought it was beautiful, like something out of
a dream. I got all excited about it.
That's when she died?
Don't.
I can't acknowledge that.
I search for words. For proof.
"That can't be true... I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote."
I retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the
battery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up
Mitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.
I rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.
"Wha...?"
First one letter, then another.
The words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.
Before long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by
one, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding
down delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.
"Why...?" I ask very quietly.
The kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.
Three years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet
with a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach
to Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put
Halley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4
billion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly
seventy-five thousand miles of Earth—closer than the moon. The tail of this
shining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first
time in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it
welcomed Comet Tiamat.
Until the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's
nucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in
diameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,
plummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per
second. Tragically, it struck Japan—a residential area called Itomori.
The town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision
occurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which
must have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.
The meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The
destruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge
hole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,
magnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds
later, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater
part of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the
town's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in
human history.
Since the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,`,length:4106,num_lines:68,location:"Itomori",importance:1,conflict:1,characters:[{name:"Loss And Grief",role:"Characters confront the tragedy of the past.",importance:1,emotion:"Sorrow and disbelief",sentiment:-1,quote:"Three years ago...she died?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Memory",role:"Struggle between memories and current reality.",importance:1,emotion:"Confusion and desperation",sentiment:-1,quote:"That can't be true...

Damage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the
thousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In
less than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.
Fourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori
was gone.
—These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.
Three years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet
Tiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.
.. .But that's weird.
It doesn't make sense.
I lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.
That means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.
The comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each
other.
It'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.
However, paging through books in this city library near Itomori, I'm
hopelessly confused. For a while now, in the deepest corner of my mind,
someone's been whispering, This is where you were.

I look up. Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai are standing there. They hand me a
single book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:

I turn the pages. The victims' names and addresses are given by district. I
run my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on
names I recognize.
Teshigawara, Katsuhiko (17)
Natori, Sayaka (17)
"Teshigawara and Saya..."
As I murmur, I hear Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai suck in their breath.
Then I find the names that prove it all.
Miyamizu, Hitoha (82)
Miyamizu, Mitsuha (17)
Miyamizu, \\btsuha (9)
The other two peer over my shoulder at the list.
"That's her.? It has to be some kind of mistake! I mean, she's—"
Okudera-senpai sounds as if she might burst into tears. "She's been dead for
three years."
Trying to deny her words, I shout, "Just two or three weeks ago, she—!"
It's hard to breathe. I inhale desperately and continue. This time, it comes out
as a whisper. "She told me we'd be able to see the comet."
I somehow manage to tear my eyes away from the letters that spell out
Mitsuha.
"So...!"
When I raise my head, my face is reflected in the dark window in front of
me. Who are you? I think, out of nowhere.
From deep in my mind, very far away, I hear a hoarse voice. "...My, my.

In the next room, I can hear the sounds of a dinner party.
Someone says something, there's a burst of laughter, and then applause
echoes like a downpour. It's been happening over and over for a while now. I
strain my ears, wondering what sort of group they are. No matter how hard I
listen, though, I can't make out a single word. All I can tell is that they're
speaking Japanese.
Thunk! There's a loud noise, and the next thing I know, I'm slumped over
with my head on the desk. I must've hit my forehead; a dull pain follows a little
later. I'm dead tired.
No matter how much I read the reduced-size editions of old newspapers
and magazine back issues, I can't seem to get the text into my head anymore.
I've checked my phone several times, but not one of her journal entries is on it.
Every trace is gone.
With my head still down, I open my eyes. Glaring at the desk a fraction of
an inch in front of me, I try putting into words the conclusion I've reached over
the past few hours.
"It was all just a dream, and..."
Do I want to believe that or not?
"The scenery looked familiar because I subconsciously remembered the
news from three years ago. Meaning, she was..."
What was she?
"... A ghost? Or, no... It was all a..."
All...my...
"...Delusion?"
With a start, I raise my head.
Something's disappearing.
Her—
"What was her name...?"
Tap, tap , comes a sudden knock, and the thin wooden door opens.
"Tsukasa says he's going down to take a bath."
Okudera-senpai enters wearing one of the inn's light robes. The atmosphere
in the room, which had seemed cold and isolated, suddenly softens. I feel
terribly relieved.
"Uh, Okudera-senpai?"
I get up from my chair. She's crouched down in front of her backpack.
"I've been saying all sorts of weird stuff... I'm sorry about today."
Zipping her backpack as if carefully sealing something away, Okudera-
senpai stands. Somehow she seems to move in slow motion.
".. .It's fine," she says, shaking her head with a faint smile.
"I'm sorry we could only get one room."
"Tsukasa said the same thing to me downstairs," Okudera-senpai chuckles.
We're sitting facing each other across the little table by the window.
"I don't mind a bit. They say a group just happened to be staying here
tonight, so they don't have any rooms to spare. The man who runs the inn said
it's a teachers' union social."
Then she laughingly tells me how they treated her to Asian pears in the
lounge after she got out of the bath. She's the sort of person who makes
everyone want to give her something. The scent of the inn's shampoo reaches
me, like a rare perfume from a distant, foreign land.
"Look at that. Itomori used to make braided cords. How pretty," Okudera-
senpai murmurs, flipping through a volume of local Itomori materials. It's one
of the books I borrowed from the library.
"My mother wears kimonos sometimes, so we have several of these at
home. Oh, say..."
Lifting my teacup, my hand pauses. She's examining my right wrist.
"That one on your wrist, Taki. Is that a braided cord?"
"Oh, this is..."
I set the cup down on the table and consider my arm. This is my good-luck
charm: a vivid orange cord, thicker than a thread, wound around my wrist.
...Huh?
Isn't this—?
"I think somebody gave it to me a long time ago. I wear it sometimes, for
good luck..."
The deepest part of my mind prickles again.
"Who was it?" I murmur.
I can't remember.
Still, if I follow this cord, it feels like I'll find something.
"...You, too, Taki."
The gentle voice makes me raise my head to see concern on Okudera-
senpai's face. "Why don't you go take a bath?"
"Abath... Right..."
But almost immediately my attention returns to the braided cord. I feel as
though I'll lose something forever if I let go here, and I desperately ransack my
memories. The dinner party is over, though I don't know when it ended. The
quiet song of autumn insects fills the room.
"Somebody who made braided cords told me something once."
Whose voice is that? It's kind and hoarse and tranquil. Like something from
a folktale.
"They said that cords are the flow of time itself. They twist and tangle,
come apart and reunite. They said that's time. That's..."
A mountain in autumn. The sound of a brook. The smell of water. The taste
of sweet barley tea.
"That's musubi —"
The scene bursts into my mind.`,length:6340,num_lines:130,location:"Itomori",importance:1,conflict:1,characters:[{name:"Loss And Grief",role:"Characters grapple with the loss of loved ones and the impact of their absence.",importance:1,emotion:"Heartbroken and confused",sentiment:-1,quote:"She's been dead for three years.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Memory",role:"The protagonist struggles with memories and their sense of self in relation to the past.",importance:1,emotion:"Confused and searching",sentiment:0,quote:"Who are you?

The sake we offered to it.
"...That place...!"
I pull a map out from under the pile of books and open it. It's a map of
Itomori from three years ago that I found in a small independent shop, covered
in dust. The topography from back when there was just one lake. The place
where we offered the sake should be far outside the area the meteorite
destroyed.
If I go there... If that sake's there...
I pick up my pencil, searching for a landform that looks likely. It was way
north of the shrine, a place like a caldera. Desperately, I try to find something
along those lines.
I might be hearing Okudera-senpai's voice, distantly, but by now, I can't
tear my eyes off the map.
...ki... Taki.
Somebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.
"Taki, Taki."
Her voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
"Don't you remember me?"
I wake up.
...That's right. I'm at an inn. I've been sleeping slumped over the table by
the window. I can sense Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai beyond the sliding door,
asleep on their futons. The room is strangely quiet. I can't hear any insects or
cars. The wind isn't blowing, either.
I sit up. The rustle of my clothes is loud enough to startle me. Outside the
window, the world is just beginning to shake off the darkness.
I look at the cord on my wrist. The faint echoes of the girl's voice linger in
my ears.
—Who are you? I ask. I don't even know her name.
Naturally, there's no answer.
But, well, that's all right.
Okudera-senpai and Tsukasa—
There's a place I need to check, no matter what. Please
go back to Tokyo ahead of me. I'm sorry for being
selfish. I swear I'll come back later. Thanks.
—Taki
I write a note. As an afterthought, I take a five-thousand-yen bill out of my
wallet and put it under a teacup along with the memo.
We've never met, but I'm about to come looking for you.
+ + +
He's gruff and doesn't say much, but he's a really nice guy , I think, studying
the sinewy hands on the steering wheel beside me.
It's the man from the ramen shop. He's the one who took us to Itomori High
School yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,
and he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn't worked, I
was planning to hitchhike, but I can't imagine any cars would've given me a
ride to a ruined, abandoned town. I'm seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.
From the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New
Itomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the
water. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams
jutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have
gotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the
place has always been like this. For that reason, I don't really know how to
process what I'm seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my
own helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much
for ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning
in the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if
the gods have set an enormous lid there.
We travel north along the lake, and when the car can't go any higher, the
man sets the parking brake.
"Looks like rain," he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. "This
mountain ain't real steep, but don't push your luck. If anythin' happens, you call
us."
"Yessir."
"Also, here—" He holds out a big lunch box to me. "Eat this up top."
Automatically, I accept it with both hands. It's heavy.
"Th-thank you very much..."
.. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,
and the ramen was super good. I can't make any of the words come out the way
I want them to—all I manage is a tiny "Thanks. Really." The guy smiles
slightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.
"I dunno what's goin' on with you," he says, exhaling smoke. "But that
picture ofltomori you made. That was good."
There's a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.
I'm walking up a path to the shrine that's as vague as a deer track.
Sometimes I stop to check the destination I've marked on the map against
the GPS on my phone. It's all right—I'm getting closer. The surrounding
scenery looks sort of familiar, but I've climbed this mountain only once, in a
dream. I'm not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow
the map.
After I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride
was completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-
senpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here
because they were worried about me. I must've looked really pathetic. I bet
they thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively
distracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn't.
I can't keep acting like that forever. I can't keep taking advantage of the
help people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the
gaps in the trees.
Suddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle
and shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.
The rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt
away.
The temperature's falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my
skin.
I eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There
are three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-
sliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like
such a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it's funny. My body shakes with
cold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and
swallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.
This is musubi, I think.
"Putting anything in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
called musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. "
That day, I decided I'd remember those words even after I woke up. I say it
aloud:
"...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That's
musubi. That's time."
I look at the cord on my wrist.
It hasn't worn through yet. The connection is still there.
Before I know it, the trees have vanished, and I'm in a mossy, rocky area.
Below me, I can see fragments of the gourd-shaped lake through gaps in the
thick clouds. I've finally reached the peak.
"...It's there!"
Sure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant
sacred tree.
"It's really there! It wasn't a dream!"
The rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears.

caldera.
In front of me, what was a little stream in my memories is now a decent-
size pond. Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that
dream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several
dozen yards away on the other side.
This is the edge of the next world.
I remember somebody saying that to me once.
Does that make this the Sanzu River?
I step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot
into a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The
heavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing
sound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with
muddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm
not welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,
into the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get
across somehow.
The massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.
I don't know whether the "body of the god" is the tree, the rock, or whether
the shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's
a little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go
down it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.
The silence here is even deeper than it was outside.
I unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to
make sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single
movement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems
completely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.
This place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.
The tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,
two four-inch urns sit side by side.
"It's the sake we carried up here."
Gently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold
anymore.
"This is her little sister's..."
My hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick
it up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put
down roots.
"And this is the one I brought."
I sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on
it. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It
must have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this
time into words.
. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?"
I untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.
"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died
three years ago when the meteorite fell?"
I pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the
lid.
"Half of her..."
I bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles
floating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.
" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then
reuniting..."
I raise the lidful of sake to my lips.
"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time..."
Take me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound
is so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it
hits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.
But nothing happens.
For a little while, I sit very still.
I'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly
vague and dizzy... But that's all.
It's no good. It didn't work.
I put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm
falling , I think.
...That's weird.
I've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back
doesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the
cave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.
"The comet...!"
Involuntarily, I say it out loud.
There's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.
It's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing
its long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and
shimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the
cave.
I stare.
The image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.
Slowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat
of its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,
shining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.

Without warning, it splits, and half of it comes plummeting down.

forms, and the village is destroyed.

dance.
Once again, ages pass.
I hear a baby crying.
"Your name is Mitsuha."
A mother's gentle voice.
Then, with a brutal sensation, the umbilical cord is cut.
Even though we were all two who lived as one in the beginning, even
though we were all connected, so humans are severed from the cord and fall
into this life.
"You're both your dad's treasures."
"You're a big sister now, sweetheart."
A young couple converses. Before long, Mitsuha's little sister is born. As if
in exchange for that joy, her mother falls ill.
"When is Mommy cornin' back from the hospital?"
The little sister's question is innocent, but the older sister knows their
mother is never coming back. Everyone dies. It's inevitable, but it isn't easy to
accept.
"They couldn't save her!"
The father grieves deeply. He has never loved anyone as much as he loved
his wife, and he never will again. It's both a blessing and a curse that, as they
grow, his daughters look more and more like their mother.
"Taking over the shrine won't do any—"
"What are you saying?! Why do you think we formally adopted you when
you married?!"
The father and grandmother quarrel more every day.
"I loved Futaba, not Miyamizu Shrine."
"Get out!"
Both the father and the grandmother are too old to change their priorities.
The father can't take it, and he leaves.
"Mitsuha, Yotsuha. From now on, you'll be with your gran all the time."
In a house that echoes with the click of ball-weights, the three women begin
their life together.
The days are peaceful enough. Even so, the feeling that her father has
abandoned her becomes an indelible stain inside Mitsuha.
These are...
.. .Mitsuha's memories?
As if I'm being swept along helplessly by a storm-swollen torrent, I
experience Mitsuha's time.
Then come the days I already know, the swapped days.
Seen through Mitsuha's eyes, Tokyo shines like an exotic foreign country.
Even though we share the same senses, it's as if we're seeing completely
different worlds.
"Lucky..."
I hear Mitsuha murmur.
"I bet they're together right about now."
It's the day of my date with Okudera-senpai.
'Tmgoin' to Tokyo for a bit," she tells her little sister.
Tokyo?
That night, Mitsuha opens the sliding door to her grandmother's room.
"Gran, can I ask a favor...?"
Mitsuha's long hair is chopped short. She isn't the Mitsuha I know
anymore.
"They say it'll look brightest tonight."
Teshigawara and the others invite her out. Let s go watch the comet.
Mitsuha, don't! I scream
From behind the mirror. In the peal of the wind chimes. As the wind that
stirs her hair.
Mitsuha, no, you can't go there!
Run! Get out of town before the comet falls!
But my voice doesn't reach her. She doesn't notice me.
On the night of the festival, Mitsuha and her friends look up at the comet,
now closer than the moon.
The comet suddenly splits, and its shards shine, becoming countless
shooting stars. One massive fragment of rock becomes a meteor and begins to
fall.
Even then, gazing at it, her only thought is, It's beautiful.
Mitsuha, run!
I scream at the top of my lungs.

teardrops fall relentlessly from Mitsuha's eyes, as though a faucet has broken.

heart leaps. I bend my knees, pressing my cheeks against the smooth kneecaps.

snotty and feeling herself up.

I turn around, and the old lady's standing there.
"Grandma! You're looking good!" Without thinking, I run over to her. She
has a teapot on a tray, probably planning to enjoy some tea in the living room.
"Huh? ...My. You're..."
She pulls down her reading glasses and takes a good look at my face. Her
eyes narrow softly.
"You aren't Mitsuha, are you?"
"Wha...?" How?! I feel guilty, as if some crime I knew would never come
to light has been exposed. Hang on, though. This might make things easier.
"Grandma... You knew?"
There's no particular change in the old lady's expression. As she speaks,
she lowers herself into a legless chair.
"No. But watchin' you lately reminded me. When I was a girl, I had some
strange dreams myself."
Hear that?! That's awesome—this oughta be a quick conversation, then.
Just what I'd expect from a Japanese folktale family. I join her at the table, and
the old lady fills a cup for me, too. Sipping her tea, she continues her story.
"They were very odd dreams. More than dreams, really. They were another
life. I became a boy I didn't know in a town I'd never seen before."
I swallow hard. Exactly like us...
"But one day, they ended, just like that. All I remember now is that I had
strange dreams. My memories of who I became in them disappeared
completely."
"Disappeared..."
My heart skips a beat, as if I've been told the name of a disease I'm fated to
get. She's right. For a little while, I forgot Mitsuha's name. I tried to convince
myself that it was all a delusion. The old lady's wrinkled face takes on a tinge
of loneliness.
"So treasure who you are now and the things you're seein'. No matter how
special it is, a dream's a dream. It'll disappear for sure someday, once you
wake. We all had a time like that, you know: my mother, myself, and your

The goal is to get all 188 families—about five hundred people—out of the
danger zone before the meteorite falls. The first thing we think of is
broadcasting an evacuation order.
After we run through the inevitable ridiculous ideas— We'll take over the
prime minister's official residence! Or the Diet Building! Or the NHK
Shibuya Broadcasting Center, or at least the NHK Gifu-Takayama branch
office! —we start talking about how not everybody in town will be at home
with their TVs or radios on and how even more people will be out and about
because of the autumn festival tonight. Then we fall silent, thinking.
".. .The disaster alert system!" Teshigawara shouts suddenly.
"Disaster alert system?"
"Hunh? Don't go tellin' me you don't know. There are speakers all over
town, remember?"
"Oh... That thing that starts talking out of the blue every morning and
evening? Who was born, who's having a funeral, that sort of thing?"
"Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you're inside or
out. If we send the order over that...!"
"Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn't it? Would
they let us broadcast stuff if we asked?"
"Pssh. No."
"Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we'd have a
better shot at that than at taking over NHK, but..."
"Heh-heh-heh." With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his
phone. Geez, this guy looks happy.
"We can do this!"
He holds out his phone to me.
Superimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.
"Wha...? Is this for real?"
Teshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.
"Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?"
"Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y'know? About destroyin' the
town, overthrowin' the school, stuff like that. Doesn't everybody?"
"Huh...?" That weirds me out a bit. But, no—this is...
"This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!"
Without thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara's shoulders.
"H-hey, don't get too close!"
"Huh?"
Whoa. Even his ears are red.
"What's this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?"
I look up into Teshigawara's face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,
Mitsuha, you're not to be taken lightly, are you? C'mon, c'mon! I press my
body against him some more. Here you go—have a freebie! We're sitting side
by side on an old sofa, and Tesshi's already right by the wall, so he's got
nowhere to run.
"Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!"
Teshigawara resists, big body squirming. He's a guy, for sure... Well, so
am I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,
and yells, "I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age—that ain't proper!"
"Ha..."
Even his buzzed scalp is red. He's sweating bullets, and his eyes look
almost teary.
"Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you're such a...!"
In spite of myself, I crack up laughing.
He's a really good guy, and I'm positive I can count on him.
I thought of him as a friend before, but I'd like to meet him and the others
for real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and
Saya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it'd
be a blast.
"Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me..." I'm biting back
laughter, and Teshigawara's sulking. "Will you help me think up the rest of the
evacuation plan?"
I smile at him Tesshi's face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.
Once this is over, I'll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit
dazzled.
"A-a-a...a bomb?!"
Saya yells. She's eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.
"Technically, they're called water-gel explosives. They're kinda like
dynamite," Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He's crunching away on
potato chips, and I'm noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of
convenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like
we're having a party.
Teshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully
engineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic
music to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged—something
that sounds like a strategy meeting.
Taking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.
"There's lots of explosives in my dad's company's warehouse, for construction
stuff. If I don't have to worry about gettin' caught afterward, I can snatch as
much as we need."
"Then, next," I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I'm really hungry, and
for some reason, everything I eat when I'm in Mitsuha's body tastes really
good.
"Y-y-y.. .you're gonna hijack the signal?!" Saya's voice cracks.
Munching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. "Rural wireless disaster
alert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the
transmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The
speakers are made so they'll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered
over the audio."
Melon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. "That means we can
send the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room."
I point at the map of Itomori. There's a circle with a diameter of a little less
than a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.
"This is the area that's supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you
can see, Itomori High is outside it." I tap on the location of the high school.
"In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard."
"B-but that's..." Saya begins stammering nervously. "That's a full-blown
crime!"
Even as she says it, she's putting the strawberry—which she saved for last
—in her mouth.
"We'll never get the people around here to move without committing a
crime," I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I'd scattered over
the map. That's right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it
doesn't matter whether it's a crime or not.
"Y'know, Mitsuha, it's like you're a different person."
I grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I'm in this body, I
unconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I've completely abandoned
trying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when
everything's over, nothing else matters. As long as we're all alive, things will
work out.
"...So. You're the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya," I tell her
cheerfully.
"Why?!"
"Well, you're in the broadcasting club, right?"
"Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell
you the wireless frequency," says Teshigawara.
"Huh? I can't just..."
Ignoring Saya's protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. "I'm the
explosives guy!"
"And I'm going to go talk to the mayor," I say, pointing to myself.
"Huh?!" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.
"We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just
talked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don't come out at the end,
there's no way we'll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to

in the world you are, I'll find you again. I swear."
Up in the sky, the comet's nowhere to be seen, and a few stars are beginning
to twinkle.
"Your name is Mitsuha."
I close my eyes, making sure of my memories, turning them into something I
can count on.
"It's okay. I remember!"
Confidence deepening, I open my eyes again. There's a white half-moon in
the distant horizon.
"Mitsuha, Mitsuha... Mitsuha, Misua, Misua. Your name is Misua!"
I'm yelling her name at the half-moon.
"Your name is...!"
Abruptly, the outline of the word I meant to utter blurs.
I quickly snatch up the pen and write the first letter of her name on my
palm... Or I try to.

After a single line, my hand stops. The tip of the pen starts to tremble. I
want to make it stop shaking and grip it tight. I try stabbing it in like a needle,
to carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an
inch. My lips move.
"...Who are you?"
The pen falls from my hand.
They're vanishing. Your name. Your memories.
"Why did I come here?"
I want to tether them to me somehow, to scrape the fragments of memory
together, so I say them aloud.
"Her... I came to see her! I came to save her! I wanted her to live!"
It's disappearing. Something so precious to me is disappearing.
"Who are you? Who are you, who are you, who are you...?"
Slipping away. Even the emotions I know I felt are leaving me.
"Somebody important, somebody I can't forget, somebody I didn't want to
forget!"
Everything's vanishing, sorrow and love alike. I don't even know why I'm
crying now. My emotions are disintegrating, crumbling like a sand castle.
"Who are you, who are you, who...?"
After the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it's
loneliness. In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all
that stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced
me to take.
Fine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is
loneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I
have, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet
again, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting
resolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll
forget even the fact that I've forgotten something.
And so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky
one last time:
"What's your name?"
The cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains. Asking its
question of the void over and over, it diminishes, bit by bit.
Finally, silence descends.

There's no time to explain.
For a moment, Tesshi looks dubious. Then, with a sharp "Hah!" he grins.
His smile looks like something he's mustered out of sheer desperation. "You
saw it, huh?! Then I guess we've gotta do this!"
Tesshi practically rips opens his sports bag. It's stuffed with tubes that look
like race batons wrapped in brown paper: water-gel explosives. I gulp. Tesshi
takes out a big bolt cutter, sets its blades against the chain wrapped around the
substation gate, and says, "Mitsuha.

behind us, there's a bang like a big firework bursting.
We stop the moped and look back. Two, three. One more. The explosions
echo one after another, and hallway up the mountain—where we were just a
few minutes ago—thick black smoke is rising. In slow motion, an enormous
transmission tower begins tilting.

"This is Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at Itomori Substation.
There is a danger of further explosions and forest fires."
Tesshi's moped goes off the prefectural road and climbs up a narrow
mountain track. It's the gentler slope up to the shrine—this way, we can take
the moped all the way to the back of the main building and avoid the stone
stairs on the shrine approach. The seat shakes violently, and I cling to Tesshi's
back as I listen to Saya's voice booming through the town. She sounds exactly
like her big sister. Nobody would suspect this isn't a broadcast from the town
hall.
"People in the following districts are requested to evacuate to Itomori
High School immediately. Kadoiri District, Sakagami District, Miyamori
District, Oyazawa District..."
"This's it. C'mon, Mitsuha!"
"Right!"
We leap off the moped and run down the set of wooden steps up the slope
of the mountain behind the shrine. From between the trees, I can see the roofs
of the long rows of stalls set up on the shrine grounds and the people milling
around among them, like fish crowded too closely in a dark tank. As we run,
we take off our helmets and throw them away.
"I repeat: This is Itomori Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at the
substation. There is a danger of further explosions and forest fires..."
When we hit the bottom of the stairs, we're behind the main shrine building.
The silhouettes of the people gathered for the festival are just ahead, and I hear
an uneasy murmur. Tesshi and I dash into their midst as if we're racing each
other, yelling.
"Ruuun! A forest fire's cornin'! This place ain't safe!"
Tesshi's voice is unbelievably loud, like he's using a megaphone. I shout,
too, determined not to be outdone. "Please run! There's a forest fire! Run!" We
emerge in the very center of the grounds.
"Yeah, they said there really is a forest fire!"
"C'mon, let's get outta here."

drinking, chatting away and enjoying the evening.

Tesshi's face twists with worry. Suddenly, he yells at me. "Who the hell

He's glaring at me, furious. Belatedly, I notice that Saya's call to "Please

into tears.

time. "Go talk your dad around!"

I nod as firmly as I can, then bolt into a sprint, trying to shake myself free.

lumbering crowd, under the shrine gate, down the stone stairs on the shrine
approach.
"You started all this," Tesshi'd said. He's right: This is something I—we—
started. Still running, I glance at the comet overhead. With the lights on the
ground extinguished, the comet's even brighter. Its long tail streams over the
clouds. It's scattering shining scales like a giant moth. I'm not letting you get
your way , I think, as if challenging it to a fight.
It's all right. You'll make it.
Somebody once told me that with conviction. I repeat the words silently to
myself.

It was early autumn, and I was still in middle school.
I'd finally gotten used to living with just my dad, and after finishing a
dinner that we'd both worked hard to make (and still hadn't been all that
good), I was drinking tea and eating an apple while Dad enjoyed a beer.
That day, the news about the comet's closest approach had pretty much
taken over the TV I wasn't all that interested in stars or the cosmos, but I did
find it kind of amazing how the universe is actually overflowing with
phenomena that exist on a completely different scale from humans, like a solar
orbit that lasts twelve hundred years or an orbital radius over 10.4 billion
miles. As impressions went, it was dumb. Still, it struck me as so awesome
that it made me shiver and, at the same time, so frightening it set my heart
trembling as well.
"Look!"
Suddenly, the announcer who'd been delivering commentary yelled in
excitement.
"The comet appears to have split in two. Around it are...what seem to be
countless shooting stars."
When the camera zoomed in, the comet really had forked above the
background of Tokyo skyscrapers. Thin lines like a meteor shower appeared
and disappeared at its tip. There was a delicate, almost artificial beauty about
it, and my eyes went wide.
+ +
Abruptly, the wireless broadcast is interrupted by the click of an opening door.
I hear a short shriek from Saya, and then several familiar male voices
emerge from the speakers.
"Kid, what are you doin'?!"
"Hurry, shut it off!"
There's a clatter like a chair falling over, and then the wireless broadcast
cuts off with a brief burst of shrill feedback.
"Saya...!" I stop, calling her name involuntarily.
The teachers caught her. Large beads of sweat pop out as if they've just
remembered their jobs, falling to the asphalt with audible drips. I'm on the
road that circles around the lake, the one that goes to the town hall and the high
school, and I start hearing bewildered voices from several evacuees.
"What? What's goin' on?"
"Huh? Was there some sort of trouble?"
"What about the evacuation?"
Oh no. A moment later, a voice booms from the wireless speakers again.
"This is Itomori Town Hall."
It's not Saya or her big sister. It's the middle-aged guy in charge of Town
Hall broadcasts, someone I hear every once in a while.
"We are currently looking into the circumstances surrounding the
accident. We request that all residents refrain from panicking. Please stay
where you are and wait for further instructions."
I lurch forward again.
They figured out where the broadcast was coming from, and the town hall
contacted the school. Saya's going to get grilled by the teachers. Tesshi will be
in big trouble, too, if this keeps up.

see anyone around me. There's only the voice from the wireless broadcast,
issuing orders to stay put. As I run, I spit out the saliva that's pooled in my
mouth, wiping my sweaty, tear-streaked, cobweb-sticky face with my sleeve.

I was channel surfing. Every station jabbered excitedly about the unexpected
astronomy show.
"The comet has definitely split in two."
"This wasn't predicted beforehand, correct?"
"Still, what an extraordinarily fantastic sight..."
"Is it safe to conclude that the nucleus of the comet has divided?"
"The tidal forces don't seem to have surpassed the Roche limit, so it's
possible that an abnormality of some kind occurred within the comet itself—"
"As of yet, the National Astronomical Observatory has issued no
statement..
"A similar case occurred in 1994, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy fell into
Jupiter. On that occasion, it split into at least twenty-one fragments..
"Do you suppose it's dangerous?"
"Comets are masses of ice, so we believe it will melt before it reaches
Earth's surface. Even if it does become a meteorite, in terms of probability, the
likelihood that it will fall on an inhabited area is extremely low..."
"It's difficult to predict the trajectories of the fragments in real time—"
"The fact that we're witnessing such a magnificent astronomical
phenomenon, combined with the fact that it happens to be nighttime in Japan,
may be the sort of good fortune that comes only once in a thousand years for
those of us who are alive in this era—"
"I'm gonna go look!" I told my dad.
Without even thinking about it, I jumped up from my chair and rushed down
the building's stairs.
From a hill in the neighborhood, I watched the night sky.
It held innumerable sparkling lights, as if another Tokyo had been layered
over the sky. It was like a scene from a dream, a view that was simply, utterly
beautiful.

The comet, split in two, brings my own solitude into stark relief as I race
through the blacked-out town like a lost child.
Who, who? Who is he?
Without taking my eyes off the comet, running as if I'm perpetually falling, I
desperately try to think.
Someone important. Someone I can't forget. Someone I didn't want to
forget.
It's not much farther to Town Hall. Not much longer until that comet
becomes a meteorite.
Who? Who? Who are you?
I summon the very last of my strength and pick up speed.
—What's your name?
"Aah!" I cry out automatically.
My toe caught in a pit in the asphalt, and in the moment I realize I'm falling,
the ground is already imminent. There's a shock, a blow to the face. My body
tumbles limply. Stabbing pain spreads through me. My field of vision spins,
and my consciousness goes black.
.But.
Your voice reaches me.
"So we don't forget each other after we wake up."
That's what you said then, and...
"Let's write down our names."
You wrote on my hand.
On the ground, I open my eyes.
My pain-blurred vision finds my clenched right hand. I open the fingers, or
try to. They're stiff and wooden. Even so, little by little, I uncurl them.
There are letters there. I strain my eyes.
I love you
For a moment, I stop breathing. I try to stand. My muscles feel weak, and it
takes a long time. Even so, I manage to get myself back on my feet, standing on
the asphalt. Then I look at my palm one more time. All that's written there, in
nostalgic handwriting I've seen somewhere before, are the words I love you.
...But this isn't... Tears spill over, and my vision blurs again. Something
like a warm wave spreads through me, like a spring that's welled up with the
tears. Still crying, I laugh, talking to you.
This doesn't tell me your name.
Then one more time, I surge forward with all my might.
I'm not afraid of anything now. I'm not scared of anyone. I'm not lonely
anymore.
I finally understand.
I'm in love. We're in love.
That means we'll meet again. I'm sure of it.
And so I'll live.
I'll survive this.
No matter what happens, even if the stars fall, I will live.

Right up until it happened, no one managed to predict that the comet's nucleus
would shatter near Earth, or that there was a huge rocky mass buried in its ice-
covered core.

occurred at 8:42 pm.

The meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The
crater formed by the impact was nearly half a mile across. Water from the lake
beside it rushed in, swallowing the remains of the town. Itomori became the
site of the worst meteorite disaster in human history.
I remember these things as I look down over gourd-shaped New Itomori
Lake. It reflects the sun in the midst of a faint morning haze, endlessly serene.
It's hard to imagine that three years ago it was the site of such a tragedy. I can't
quite believe that the comet I saw in the sky over Tokyo did this.

I have a few habits I've unconsciously picked up.
For example, when I'm feeling rushed and flustered, I touch the back of my
neck. When I wash my face, I look into my eyes, reflected in the mirror. Even
on mornings when I'm in a hurry, when I step out the front door, I pause and
take a long look at the scenery.
I also gaze at my palm for no reason.

As the synthetic audio announces the station, I realize I'm doing it again. I
look away from my right hand, gazing absently out the window instead. We're
slowing down, and beyond the glass, the crowd of people standing on the
platform flows by.
Abruptly, my whole body breaks out in goose bumps.
A beat later, I think, It s her.
She was standing on the platform.
The train stops. Even waiting for the doors to open seems to take too long,
and I leave the train at a sprint. I turn in a circle, scanning the platform. Several
passengers dart suspicious glances at me as they pass, and my head finally
cools down.`,length:1031,num_lines:20,location:"Yoyogi",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Memory",role:"Reflecting on past moments",importance:.7,emotion:"Longing and anticipation",sentiment:.5,quote:"I pause and take a long look at the scenery.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Search For Connection",role:"Seeking a significant encounter",importance:.9,emotion:"Excitement and urgency",sentiment:.7,quote:"Abruptly, my whole body breaks out in goose bumps.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Time",role:"The feeling of time slowing down",importance:.6,emotion:"Impatience",sentiment:-.2,quote:"Even waiting for the doors to open seems to take too long.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Interview Anxiety",summary:"The protagonist struggles during a job interview.",chapter:"Chapter Eight Your Name.",first_line:21,last_line:70,text:`I'm not looking for anyone in particular.

This is yet another habit I've picked up unawares, and it's probably a
weird one.
The next thing I know, still standing on the platform, I'm gazing at my palm
again. Just a little more, I think.
Just a little longer. Just a little more.
I don't know what wish accompanies those words, but somewhere along
the way, I've started longing for it.
"I applied to your company because I like buildings— Or, no...I mean
cityscapes. The landscape of people living their lives in general."
The faces of the four interviewers in front of me cloud slightly. No, no,
that's just my imagination , I think. This is the first time I've managed to make
it to the second round of interviews at a company. I can't blow this chance , I
think, psyching myself up again.
"I always have. Even I don't really understand why, but, um... Anyway, I
like them. What I mean is, I like watching buildings and the people who live
and work there. That's why I often go to cafes and restaurants. I even worked
at a few part-time—"
"I see." One of the interviewers cuts me off gently. "Then could you tell us
why you chose to enter the construction field, rather than the restaurant
industry?"
She's a middle-aged woman, the only one of the four who looked kind, and
I finally realize I've been blabbing about an irrelevant reason for applying. I
break out in a sweat in a suit I'm not yet used to wearing.
"Well, I... Serving customers at my part-time job was fun, but I guess you
could say I wanted to be involved in something bigger..."
Something bigger? That's a middle school answer. Even I can tell my face
is flushing red.
"I mean... The way I see it, there's no telling when even Tokyo could
disappear."
This time, the interviewers' faces really do cloud over. Realizing I've been
touching the back of my neck, I hastily put hands on my knees again.
"So if it does— No, precisely because it will someday, I want to create the
sort of town that warms people, even if it's only a memory—"
Agh, it's no good. Even I can't follow what I'm saying. I've failed this one,
too. Thinking this, I glance at the gray skyscrapers that tower behind the
interviewers, and I feel like crying.
"So? How many companies have you interviewed at, including today?"
Takagi asks me.
"I'm not keeping track," I tell him glumly.
Looking awfully entertained, Tsukasa says, "I don't think you're going to
make it."
"I don't want to hear that from you," I cut back crossly
"Sure it's not because you just don't look good in a suit?" Takagi grins.
"You guys aren't much different!" I bristle angrily.
"I've got unofficial offers from two companies," he counters cheerfully.
"I have eight," Tsukasa condescends.
"Rrgh...!"
I have no comeback. My coffee cup rattles in my fingers as they tremble
with humiliation.`,length:2820,num_lines:50,location:"Job Interview Setting",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Self-doubt",role:"The protagonist struggles with confidence during the interview.",importance:.9,emotion:"anxiety and embarrassment",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I can't blow this chance, I think, psyching myself up again.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Ambition",role:"The protagonist expresses a desire to create meaningful work.",importance:.7,emotion:"hopeful yet uncertain",sentiment:.3,quote:"I want to create the sort of town that warms people, even if it's only a memory.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Peer Comparison",role:"The protagonist feels inferior compared to peers' success.",importance:.6,emotion:"frustration and humiliation",sentiment:-.4,quote:"I have eight,",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Café Reunion",summary:"The protagonist meets Okudera-senpai and reflects on the past.",chapter:"Chapter Eight Your Name.",first_line:71,last_line:180,text:`Tweedle.
My phone chirps from the table. I check the message, drain what's left of
my coffee in one gulp, and stand.
Come to think of it, the three of us came to this cafe a lot when we were in
high school. The memory strikes me after I've waved good-bye to Tsukasa and
Takagi and started jogging toward the station. Life was so carefree back then. I
didn't have to think about the future or finding a job, and somehow, every day
was ludicrously fun. Especially that one summer—I think it was during my
second year of high school. It seems like that summer was especially thrilling.
What happened that year? I think back and conclude there wasn't anything in
particular. I guess I must've just been at an age when absolutely anything was
enough to trigger a giggling fit.
...Wait, no, that's something they say about girls... Absentmindedly, I hop
down the stairs to the subway.
"Ooh. Job hunting, hmm?"
Okudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.
It's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly
languid hum of people released from their days at work or school.
"Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great."
"Hmm..." Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She
inspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, "You don't
think it's because suits don't look good on you?"
"I-is it really that bad?!" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.
"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!"
Okudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.
"Let's walk a little," Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,
going against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut
across Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that
the trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass
have on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,
too.
"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue."
Feeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to
Okudera-senpai beside me.
"What?" Her glossy lips pout. "I can't get in touch with you without a
reason?"
"No, no, no!" I wave my hands hastily.
"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time."
"Y-yes. I am."
She smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. "I was in the area
for work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki." She was hired by a major
clothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. "Life in the suburbs
is fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind," she tells me, gazing at
her surroundings like she's a little awestruck. "Look," she says suddenly, and I
raise my head.
We're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant
outdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage
of gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster—Eight
Years Later in big letters.
"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,
as though she's searching distant memories. "You were still in high school,
Taki, so it must've been..."
"Five years ago, maybe?" I finish the sentence for her.
"That long..." She exhales a little, as if surprised. "I'm forgetting all sorts
of things."
She's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk
up Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I
try remembering that day.
It was the summer of my second year in high school— No, it was just about
this time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short
trip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way
to Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.
Right, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the
side of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur
and grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a
vague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed
a mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to
Tokyo by myself the next day.
That's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that
comet.
In the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human
history, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,
almost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the
comet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and
most of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.
It was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all
sorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical
phenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the
media's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around
wildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit
with Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or
questioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an
evacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been
foretold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so
isolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the
power across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite
strike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the
programs to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as
with most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of
Itomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.
Still... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of
Itomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had
materialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had
visited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.
What in the world had it been?
Well, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink
into the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I
write the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job
next year, not ancient history I don't really remember.
"The wind's come up," Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair
rises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,
reaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a
melancholy inside me.
"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough," Okudera-senpai
says when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.
We ate dinner at the Italian restaurant where we'd worked part-time as
students. Thanks to a promise I totally don't remember making—"Come to
think of it, Taki, didn't you say you'd treat me after you graduated from high
school?"—I ended up paying for Okudera-senpai. Even so, I felt a little bit
proud picking up the check.`,length:7077,num_lines:110,location:"Yotsuya",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Memory",role:"Reflecting on carefree past",importance:.9,emotion:"Melancholic joy",sentiment:.5,quote:"Life was so carefree back then.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Job Hunting",role:"Struggles with adulthood",importance:.8,emotion:"Anxiety",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Ha-ha.

"Yeah, all the meals they gave us during our shifts were like school
lunches."
"We went for years without catching on."
We laugh. Okudera-senpai draws a deep, contented breath, then says, "All
right. I'll see you later." She waves at me, and there's a band like a thin drop
of water shining on her ring finger.
"You'll find happiness someday, too," she'd assured me earlier over an
espresso, after informing me she was getting married. I couldn't manage a good
response—I just mumbled something congratulatory.
I'm not particularly unhappy , I think, watching Okudera-senpai's
silhouette descend the pedestrian-bridge stairs. That said, I don't really
understand what happiness is yet, either.
I abruptly inspect my palm. All that's there is an absence.
Just a little longer..., I think one more time.
Before I know it, the season's changed again.
An unusually typhoon-filled autumn passed, moving straight into a winter of
nothing but cold rain. Tonight, too, the rain is whispering down unabated, like
the memory of a pleasant chat on some bygone day Christmas lights twinkle
beyond windows beaded thickly with water droplets.
I take a sip from my paper cup of coffee, as if swallowing my scattered
thoughts, then look down at my notebook again. Even now, in December, it's
packed with job-hunting appointments.
Visits with former upperclassmen to discuss their work, information
sessions, entry deadlines, paper schedules, interview dates. The range is
chaotic, covering everything from major general contractors to design offices
to old-town factories, and as I check the notebook against the schedule on my
phone, even I'm a bit disgusted by it. I start organizing the main points from
tomorrow onward, writing them into my notebook.
"Y'know, I'd like to go to at least one more bridal fair."
Mixed with the sound of the rain, the conversations of strangers sound a bit
like secrets. The couple behind me has been discussing their wedding for a
while now, and it makes me think of Okudera-senpai. Their voices and bearing
are completely different, though. There's a bit of an easygoing regional accent
to their speech, and their conversation seems completely relaxed, as if they're
childhood friends. I'm not really listening, but my ears pick up what they're
saying.
"Again?" The guy sounds annoyed, but even then, there's no mistaking the
affection in his tone. "We've been to a ton of fairs already. They were all
pretty much the same stuff."
"Well, I was thinkin' a Shinto ceremony might be nice, too."
"You said your dream was to have it in a chapel."
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I can't make up my mind that easily."
"But you said you did make up your mind," the guy quietly complains, and I
chuckle.
The girl ignores him. "Hmm.she murmurs, thinking. "Never mind that.
Tesshi, you gotta shave off those whiskers before the ceremony."
I was about to drink my coffee, but my hand stops dead.
My pulse is speeding up, though I don't understand why.
"I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?"
"But you're eatin' cake!"
"I'll start for real tomorrow!"
Slowly, I look behind me.
The two of them have already gotten up from their chairs and are pulling on
their coats. The tall, skinny guy is wearing a stocking cap over his buzzed
head. I just catch a glimpse of his profile. The girl is petite, and her bobbed
hair makes her seem young, almost like a student. The pair turns away and
leaves the cafe. For some reason, I can't take my eyes off their backs.
"Thank you for your visit." The cafe employee's voice reaches my ears
indistinctly, mingled with the rain.
By the time I leave the cafe, the rain has turned to snow.
Maybe it's because of all the moisture up in the atmosphere, but the town is
oddly warm in the falling snow. I feel strangely uneasy, as if I've wandered
into the wrong season. It seems to me as if each and every person I pass is
hiding some important secret, and in spite of myself, I keep turning back to
look at them.
I go straight to the ward library, which is almost ready to close for the
evening. The sparseness of the handful of readers in the vast, vaulted space
makes the air inside feel even chillier than outside. I take a seat and open the
book I've retrieved from the stacks. The title is Vanished Itomori—Complete
Records. It's a collection of photographs.
As if removing an ancient seal, I slowly page through the book.
Gingko trees and an elementary school. The shrine's steep stairs, with their
view over the lake. A shrine gate with peeling paint. A tiny railroad crossing,
like toy building blocks abruptly set down in the fields. A pointlessly
expansive parking lot, two snack bars right next to each other, a drab concrete
high school. A prefectural road with old, cracked asphalt. A guardrail that
traces a winding hill road. Vinyl greenhouses, reflecting the sky.
They're the sort of ordinary sights you see all over Japan, so I recognize all
of them.

Why is this so... ? I wonder as I turn the pages.
Why do the unremarkable sights of a town that no longer exists make my
heart hurt this much?
+ + +
Once, fueled by intense emotions, I made some sort of resolution.
I remember this out of nowhere when I look up at the light in somebody's
window on my way home, or when I reach for a box lunch in the convenience
store, or when I retie my loose shoelaces.
I decided something once. I took an oath because I met somebody—no, so
that I would meet somebody.
Washing my face and staring into the mirror, tossing a plastic bag in the
trash, squinting at the morning sun between the buildings, I think this and smile
wryly.
"Somebody," "something." In the end, I don't know a thing.
Still, I think as I close the door at an interview.
Still, even now, I'm fighting my way through. Perhaps it's a bit dramatic to
say, but I'm struggling against life. Wasn't that what I decided once? To
struggle. To live. To breathe and walk. To run. To eat. To bind, musubi. To live
an ordinary life so I shed tears over the sights of a perfectly ordinary town.
Just a little longer , I think.
Just a little is fine. Just a little more.
I don't know what it is I want, but I keep on wishing for something.
Just a little longer. Just a little more.
The cherry blossoms bloom and scatter, long rains wash the streets, white
clouds billow high, the leaves change color, freezing winds blow. Then the
cherry trees bloom again.
The days are accelerating.
I've graduated from university, and I'm working at the job I somehow
managed to find. I spend every day with the desperation of a man trying not to
be flung from a careening vehicle. There are times when I can believe I'm
getting closer, in very tiny increments, to the place I want to be.
In the morning, when I wake up, I stare at my right hand. There are little
drops of water on my index finger. By the time I notice them, both the dream I
was in a moment earlier and the tears that for an instant stained my eyes have
evaporated.
Just a little longer. With that thought, I get out of bed.
Just a little longer.
As I recite the wish, I face the mirror and tie my hair cord. I pull my arms
through the sleeves of my spring suit. I open the door of my apartment and, for
a moment, gaze at the Tokyo cityscape that unfurls before me. I climb the
station stairs, go through the automated turnstile, and board a packed commuter
train. The little patch of blue sky I can see beyond the heads of the crowd is
piercingly clear.
I lean against the train door, looking out. The city teems with people, in the
windows of buildings, in cars, on pedestrian bridges. A hundred people to a
car, a thousand people to a train, a thousand trains crisscrossing the city.
Gazing at them, I make my wish. Just a little longer.
In that instant, with absolutely no warning, I see her.
And then, I see him.
He's there, close enough to touch if it weren't for the windowpanes, on a
train running parallel to this one. He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are
wide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so
long really is.
She's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know
it's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes
between us, and I lose sight of her.
But I finally know what I'm wishing for.
I wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.
I want to be with him, just a little more.
The train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already
positive she's looking for me, too.
We've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an
assumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.
Even so, I—we—wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be
together, just a little more.

I turn at a narrow alley, and the road drops off. Stairs. I walk
over to them, look down.. .and there he is.
Fighting back the urge to run, I climb the stairs slowly. A wind that smells
like flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the
top of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the
corner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts
softly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.
As we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say
anything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each
other. In that moment, I feel a tense, squeezing pain all over, as though
something inside me has taken hold of my heart. This is wrong, I think fiercely.
We can't possibly be strangers. It goes against something as basic as the
mechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...
And so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed. She's
standing on the stairs, the streets of Tokyo behind her, her eyes wide and round.
I realize her long hair is tied back with a cord the color of the evening sun. My
whole body trembles slightly.
I finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into
tears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.
Even as I cry, I smile, too. The spring air carries with it all sorts of
apprehension and anticipation, and I draw a deep breath.
Then we open our mouths at the same time.

To be honest, I didn't intend to write this novel.
It may be rude to the readers for me to say something like that, but I thought
your name, worked best as an animated film
This book, your name., is the novel version of an animated movie I
directed, which is scheduled to open in the summer of 2016. In other words,
it's a novelization of the movie, but actually, as I'm writing this afterword, the
movie hasn't been finished yet. They tell me it will take another three months
or so to complete. That means the novel will go out into the world first, so if
you asked me which is the original work, the movie or the novel, I'd have to
say, "It's complicated." Writing this book has altered some of my personal
impressions as well. For example, Mitsuha was a pretty laid-back, optimistic
kid, wasn't she? and Taki really is hopeless with women. It's likely to
influence the postrecording (when the actors and voice actors create the voices
for us) for the movie. This "gift exchange" between a movie and a novel was a
first for me, and to tell the truth, it was a lot of fun.
There are no major differences between the novel and the movie as far as
the story is concerned, but there are slight differences in the way it's told. The
novel is written from Taki's and Mitsuha's first-person perspectives; in other
words, from their viewpoints only. They can't tell us about things they don't
know. Meanwhile, movies generally use third-person perspectives: the world
as the camera shows it to us. For that reason, many scenes are literally told
from a high-angle viewpoint and include characters other than Taki and
Mitsuha. I think it's more than possible to enjoy either work on its own, but due
to the unique characteristics of each medium, they inevitably complement each
other.
I wrote the novel on my own, but movies are made by the hands of many
people. The script for your name, took shape over several months of
preliminary meetings with the Toei (the movie company) your name. team.
Producer Genki Kawamura's suggestions were always brisk and decisive, and
although I sometimes secretly thought, He's really superficial (because he's the
sort of person who says even important things like they don't mean much), he
always showed me the way.
In addition, I wrote this book both at home and in the movie production
studio, about half in each location, and I think it's thanks to the animation
director, Masashi Ando, that I managed to complete it. It wasn't that I
discussed the novel with him It's just that, thanks to his truly dedicated work
on the movie itself, I was able to relax even in the pandemonium of an
animated film production site and make time to work on the book.
Then there's the score by RADWIMPS, the group in charge of the movie's
music. Naturally, there's no background music in the novel, but the book was
greatly influenced by the world of RADWIMPS's lyrics. The role music plays
in the your name, movie is a big one, and I hope you'll pay particular attention
to how it was rendered in both the movie and the novel. (In order to do that, I
guess you'll need to see the movie. Please do go see it!)
I wrote in the beginning that I thought this story worked best as an animated
film, but that's because the movie is—as I mentioned before—a splendid
crystallization of the talents of many people. I think movies are in a place that's
far beyond the ability of individuals.
Even so, in the end, I did write a novel version.
At some point, I changed my mind, and I began wanting to write it.
I had the feeling that, somewhere, there were boys and girls like Taki and
Mitsuha. This story is a fantasy, of course, but I do think there are people
somewhere who've had experiences similar to theirs, and who hold similar
feelings inside. People who've lost precious loved ones or places, and who've
privately decided to "struggle and fight," even so. People who believe that
they're sure to find something someday, even though it hasn't happened yet, and
who keep reaching out for it. I felt that those feelings needed to be related with
an immediacy that differed from the glamour of the movie, and I think that's
why I wrote this book.
Thank you very much for picking it up, and for reading it.

Genki Kawamura
"Please write the essay."
That's what Makoto Shinkai said to me in a meeting room at CoMix Wave
Films.
The sudden request flustered me, and I told him I thought interpretive
essays should be written objectively, by third parties.
I'm the producer of the your name, movie, and I don't have that perspective
anymore.
Even so, Shinkai wouldn't back down. He pressed me. Please. I want you
to do this, no matter what.
Several months later, I read the novel. It was a wonderful book.
At that point, I thought I understood why Shinkai had asked me for the
essay.
He didn't want me to "interpret" anything, I realized. He wanted somebody
who was "in the family" to reveal how this novel came to be.
Two years ago, I decided to make a feature film with Makoto Shinkai.
That night, I was drinking sake with him at a cheap pub under the elevated
tracks in Yurakucho.
We were talking, me with a highball, him with a draft beer.
Voices of a Distant Star. The Place Promised in Our Early Days. 5
Centimeters Per Second.
Shinkai writes love stories about boys and girls who pass each other by in
beautiful, magnificent worlds. I told him I wanted him to make his newest work
"Makoto Shinkai's best film."
I wanted people who didn't yet know Shinkai to encounter his world and be
astonished (the way I was floored when I saw Voices of a Distant Star
fourteen years ago). I also wanted people who had kept up with Shinkai's
works to witness, as if for the first time, what this particular talent could
accomplish.
In addition, I told him I wanted the new work to be endlessly musical.
(Makoto Shinkai's works always have splendid music.) I asked him if there
were any musicians he liked, and he named a certain band. I'd been on friendly
terms with that band's front man for a while, and under the i nfl uence of drink, I
sent him a text.
"I started looking for you in your third life back."
Half a year later, Yojiro Noda of RAD WIMPS sent over a demo of "Third
Life Back," the theme song. It was a fantastic track that will probably turn out
to be epoch-making for RAD WIMPS as well.
"I'm so psyched that I'm out in a downpour getting soaked as I listen to it."
For some reason, that Line message from Shinkai almost made me cry.
In this world, which is overflowing with encounters, it's hard to find your
soul mate. Even if you do find them, who's going to prove to you that they
really are your soul mate?
Makoto Shinkai and Yojiro Noda wrote the story of a pair who keep
missing each other in an endlessly big world.
These two met as if guided by fate, and the result was a miraculous
collaboration (even if it was triggered by a pub under the train tracks).
Makoto Shinkai wrote the story and script, Yojiro Noda picked them up and
expanded them as music, and together, they became this book. In addition,
although the movie is nearly finished, because this book was written, it's
filling out even more. Seriously, how was this production so lucky?
"I'm not going to write a novel this time."
That's what Shinkai said, but Yojiro Noda's music made him write it.
It's not possible to play audio in novels, but I can hear RAD WIMPS's
songs from this one.
I think it's a rare book, the product of a fateful encounter.
In 2012,1 wrote a novel called If Cats Disappeared from the World.
It was a portrait of a dying postman.
I thought I was writing about death, but at some point, it turned into a story
about memories.
What is the crudest thing, as far as people are concerned? Death, naturally.
That's what I always thought.
However, there's something that's cruder than death.
It's forgetting the person you love while you're alive.
Where do human memories live?
Are they in the synaptic circuitry of the brain? Do retinas and fingertips
hold memories, too? Or is there an invisible, amorphous, mistlike, spiritual
collective somewhere, and that's where the memories reside? Something we'd
call the heart or the mind or the soul. Is it something you can take out and stick
back in, like a memory card with an OS on it?
In the book, Taki wonders to himself about this.
Humans are mysterious creatures. We forget the important things, and all
we remember are the things that don't matter. Unlike memory cards, we don't
have the ability to keep the important stuff and delete what we don't need. I
always wondered why that was.
However, now that I've read this book, I feel as if I understand, just a little.
People forget the important things.
That said, by resisting, by struggling against that, they gain life.
your name., a movie that tells the love story of a boy and girl "struggling,
magnificently" in this cruel world, will be completed very shortly. Without a
doubt, it's going to be "Makoto Shinkai's best film"— No, let me rephrase that.
The world is about to meet "Makoto Shinkai's ultimate masterpiece."
Now, with the same feelings as the people who've read this novel, I'm
looking forward to my encounter with that movie from the bottom of my heart.
