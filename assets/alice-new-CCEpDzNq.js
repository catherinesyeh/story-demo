bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice
"without pictures or conversations?"
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.
There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

in the world she was to get out again.`,length:1442,num_lines:23,location:"A Riverbank",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"curious and bored girl seeking adventure",importance:.9,emotion:"curious and restless",sentiment:.5,quote:"what is the use of a book without pictures or conversations?",importance_rank:1},{name:"White Rabbit",role:"anxious creature in a hurry",importance:.7,emotion:"anxious and hurried",sentiment:.2,quote:"Oh dear!

dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE", but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.
"Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!"

many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud. "I must be

several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and

practice to say it over) "—yes, that's about the right distance—but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" (Alice had no
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—" (she was rather
glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all
the right word) "—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"

Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" and
sometimes, "Do bats eat cats?" for, you see, as she couldn't answer
either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly,

she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; "and even if my head would go through," thought
poor Alice, "it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.`,length:2086,num_lines:32,location:"A Long, Low Hall With Locked Doors",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Curious and determined to follow the White Rabbit and explore the hall and the garden beyond",importance:1,emotion:"Eager and frustrated",sentiment:.5,quote:"Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!

back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, ("which certainly was not here
before," said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words "DRINK ME," beautifully printed on it in large
letters.
It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was
not going to do _that_ in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she said,
"and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not"; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.
However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so Alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.`,length:1387,num_lines:22,location:"Alice's Table",importance:.8,conflict:.4,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Curious and cautious about the mysterious bottle",importance:1,emotion:"Curious and cautious",sentiment:.5,quote:"No, I'll look first, and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not.",importance_rank:1}],number:6,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Shrinking and the Lost Key",summary:"Alice shrinks after drinking the potion but forgets the key and is unable to climb the table to reach it.",chapter:"CHAPTER I.",first_line:136,last_line:154,text:`"What a curious feeling!" said Alice; "I must be shutting up like a
telescope."
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; "for it might end, you know,"
said Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
wonder what I should be like then?" And she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.`,length:1197,num_lines:19,location:"Wonderland",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Alice is experiencing a transformation and trying to navigate her new size to access the garden.",importance:1,emotion:"frustrated and curious",sentiment:-.5,quote:"What a curious feeling!

rather sharply; "I advise you to leave off this minute!" She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
"But it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two
people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
person!"
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
"EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants. "Well, I'll eat it," said
Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, "Which way? Which
way?", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.`,length:1544,num_lines:24,location:"Wonderland",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Alice is trying to navigate her feelings of confusion and frustration about her size and identity, while also contemplating her options to enter the garden.",importance:1,emotion:"frustrated and curious",sentiment:.2,quote:"Well, I'll eat it, and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!",importance_rank:1}],number:8,importance_rank:8,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Alice Grows Tall",summary:"Alice drinks from a bottle and grows incredibly tall, her head hitting the ceiling.",chapter:"CHAPTER II.",first_line:1,last_line:21,text:`The Pool of Tears
"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); "now I'm
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!"
(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off). "Oh, my poor little feet, I
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm
sure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I
want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas."
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must
go by the carrier," she thought; "and how funny it'll seem, sending
presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!

found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; "and
now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the little

her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small

slipped in like herself.
"Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she
began: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
of swimming about here, O Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse—of
a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!") The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.
"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's
a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror." (For, with all
her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) So she began again: "Où est ma chatte?" which
was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. "Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she

_you_ like cats if you were me?"
"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone: "don't be angry
about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
quiet thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, "and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse—and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
pardon!" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. "We won't talk
about her any more if you'd rather not."
"We indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name
again!"
"I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. "Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?" The Mouse did not
answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near
our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things—I can't remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says
it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
"I'm afraid I've offended it again!" For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.
So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the
Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low

They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, "I am
older than you, and must know better;" and this Alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon make
you dry enough!" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she

Duck: "it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the

the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.
"What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."
"What _is_ a Caucus-race?" said Alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact
shape doesn't matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. There was no "One, two, three, and
away," but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out "The race is over!" and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
said, "_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes."
"But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.
"Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"`,length:1975,num_lines:32,location:"A Courtroom",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Dodo",role:"Proposes the idea of a Caucus-race to dry off the group",importance:.7,emotion:"Solemn and slightly offended",sentiment:.2,quote:"I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—",importance_rank:1},{name:"Eaglet",role:"Challenges the Dodo's use of complex language and expresses skepticism",importance:.6,emotion:"Playful and mocking",sentiment:.3,quote:"Speak English!

plate with the name "W. RABBIT," engraved upon it. She went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.
"How queer it seems," Alice said to herself, "to be going messages for
a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!" And she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: "'Miss Alice! Come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!' 'Coming in a minute,
nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.' Only I
don't think," Alice went on, "that they'd let Dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!"
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
this time with the words "DRINK ME," but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. "I know _something_ interesting is sure to
happen," she said to herself, "whenever I eat or drink anything; so
I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large
again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"`,length:1666,num_lines:25,location:"W.

drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself "That's quite enough—I hope I shan't
grow any more—As it is, I can't get out at the door—I do wish I hadn't
drunk quite so much!"
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself "Now I
can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?"
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
"It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
when I grow up, I'll write one—but I'm grown up now," she added in a
sorrowful tone; "at least there's no room to grow up any more _here_."`,length:1741,num_lines:26,location:"Alice's House",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Experiencing rapid growth and confusion after drinking from the magic bottle",importance:1,emotion:"Frustrated and confused",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!",importance_rank:1}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Alice talks to herself",summary:"Alice considers the absurdity of her situation and the possibility of never growing old.",chapter:"CHAPTER IV.",first_line:69,last_line:76,text:`"But then," thought Alice, "shall I _never_ get any older than I am

"Oh, you foolish Alice!" she answered herself. "How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!"

making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes`,length:496,num_lines:8,location:"Wonderland",importance:.8,conflict:.4,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Contemplating her age and the nature of learning in Wonderland",importance:.9,emotion:"Conflicted and curious",sentiment:.2,quote:"Oh, I shouldn't like _that!_",importance_rank:1}],number:4,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:10},{title:"The Rabbit tries to get in",summary:"The Rabbit returns and tries to get into the house, but Alice is in the way.",chapter:"CHAPTER IV.",first_line:77,last_line:86,text:`she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice. "Fetch me my gloves this moment!"
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself "Then I'll
go round and get in at the window."`,length:639,num_lines:10,location:"Alice's House",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Alice is startled and anxious about the Rabbit's arrival, feeling a mix of fear and curiosity despite her size.",importance:.9,emotion:"anxious and curious",sentiment:-.2,quote:"I trembled till I shook the house, quite forgetting that I was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit.",importance_rank:1},{name:"White Rabbit",role:"The Rabbit is searching for something and is determined to find a way into the house, showing urgency and frustration.",importance:.7,emotion:"frustrated and urgent",sentiment:-.1,quote:"Then I'll go round and get in at the window.",importance_rank:2}],number:5,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Alice interacts with the animals outside",summary:"Alice interacts with the animals outside, mistaking one for the White Rabbit's servant, Bill.",chapter:"CHAPTER IV.",first_line:87,last_line:123,text:`"_That_ you won't!" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit's—"Pat! Pat! Where are you?" And
then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then I'm here! Digging
for apples, yer honour!"
"Digging for apples, indeed!" said the Rabbit angrily. "Here! Come and
help me out of _this!_" (Sounds of more broken glass.)
"Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?"
"Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum.")
"An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
window!"
"Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that."
"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!"
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, "Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
all!" "Do as I tell you, you coward!" and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. "What a number
of cucumber-frames there must be!" thought Alice. "I wonder what
they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
_could!_ I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer!"
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: "Where's the other
ladder?—Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other—Bill!

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself "This is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There goes Bill!"
then the Rabbit's voice along—"Catch him, you by the hedge!" then
silence, and then another confusion of voices—"Hold up his head—Brandy
now—Don't choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
us all about it!"
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ("That's Bill," thought
Alice,) "Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I'm better now—but I'm
a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me

There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, "I
wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
roof off." After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
Alice heard the Rabbit say, "A barrowful will do, to begin with."
"A barrowful of _what?_" thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. "I'll put a stop to
this," she said to herself, and shouted out, "You'd better not do that
again!" which produced another dead silence.
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. "If I eat one of these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make
_some_ change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it

through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.
"The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the

arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. "Poor little
thing!" said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.`,length:1788,num_lines:27,location:"A Whimsical Forest Clearing",importance:.7,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"trying to coax the puppy and avoid being eaten",importance:.9,emotion:"nervous yet playful",sentiment:.2,quote:"Poor little thing!",importance_rank:1}],number:10,importance_rank:11,conflict_rank:9},{title:"Alice searches for something to make her grow",summary:"Alice searches for something to eat or drink to make her grow back to her normal size.",chapter:"CHAPTER IV.",first_line:198,last_line:216,text:`"And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant

only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
I've got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I
suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?"
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
anything else.`,length:1162,num_lines:19,location:"A Whimsical Forest Clearing",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"curious and contemplative about her size and options for eating or drinking to grow up again",importance:.9,emotion:"curious and slightly frustrated",sentiment:.2,quote:"Oh dear!

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
"Who are _you?_" said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
rather shyly, "I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know
who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
changed several times since then."
"What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar sternly. "Explain
yourself!"
"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm
not myself, you see."
"I don't see," said the Caterpillar.
"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely,
"for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing."
"It isn't," said the Caterpillar.
"Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice; "but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then
after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
queer, won't you?"
"Not a bit," said the Caterpillar.
"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different," said Alice; "all I know
is, it would feel very queer to _me_."
"You!" said the Caterpillar contemptuously. "Who are _you?_"
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I
think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first."
"Why?" said the Caterpillar.
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.
"Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I've something
important to say!"
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
"Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.
"Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.
"No," said the Caterpillar.
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, "So you
think you're changed, do you?"
"I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alice; "I can't remember things as I
used—and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!"
"Can't remember _what_ things?" said the Caterpillar.
"Well, I've tried to say "How doth the little busy bee," but it all
came different!" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
"Repeat, "_You are old, Father William_,'" said the Caterpillar.
Alice folded her hands, and began:—
"You are old, Father William," the young man said,
"And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
"In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
"I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again."
"You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
Pray, what is the reason of that?"
"In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
"I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
Allow me to sell you a couple?"
"You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
Pray, how did you manage to do it?"
"In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life."
"You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
What made you so awfully clever?"
"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"
"That is not said right," said the Caterpillar.
"Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid," said Alice, timidly; "some of the
words have got altered."
"It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.`,length:4470,num_lines:90,location:"A Whimsical Forest Clearing",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"A curious girl trying to understand her identity and the changes she is experiencing.",importance:.9,emotion:"confused and frustrated",sentiment:-.2,quote:"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir, because I'm not myself, you see.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Caterpillar",role:"A wise but condescending creature questioning Alice's identity and understanding of change.",importance:.8,emotion:"languid and dismissive",sentiment:-.3,quote:"Who are _you?_",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Caterpillar's Advice",summary:"The Caterpillar advises Alice on how to control her size using the mushroom.",chapter:"CHAPTER V.",first_line:91,last_line:117,text:`The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
"What size do you want to be?" it asked.
"Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied; "only one
doesn't like changing so often, you know."
"I _don't_ know," said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
"Are you content now?" said the Caterpillar.
"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't
mind," said Alice: "three inches is such a wretched height to be."
"It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
"But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
thought of herself, "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
offended!"
"You'll get used to it in time," said the Caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter."
"One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_" thought Alice to
herself.

off a bit of the edge with each hand.
"And now which is which?" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.`,length:872,num_lines:14,location:"A Whimsical Forest Clearing",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Curious and adventurous, trying to understand the mushroom's effects",importance:1,emotion:"Frustrated and frightened",sentiment:-.5,quote:"And now which is which?",importance_rank:1}],number:3,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:4},{title:"The Pigeon's Accusation",summary:"Alice, with an elongated neck, is mistaken for a serpent by a Pigeon.",chapter:"CHAPTER V.",first_line:132,last_line:196,text:`* * * * * * *

"Come, my head's free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
"What _can_ all that green stuff be?" said Alice. "And where _have_ my
shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?"
She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
"Serpent!" screamed the Pigeon.
"I'm _not_ a serpent!" said Alice indignantly. "Let me alone!"
"Serpent, I say again!" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, "I've tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!"
"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said Alice.
"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
hedges," the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; "but those
serpents! There's no pleasing them!"
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon;
"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.
"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued the
Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thinking I
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!"
"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!" said Alice. "I'm a—I'm a—"
"Well! _What_ are you?" said the Pigeon. "I can see you're trying to
invent something!"
"I—I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.
"A likely story indeed!" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. "I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's
no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!"
"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very truthful
child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know."
"I don't believe it," said the Pigeon; "but if they do, why then
they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say."
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, "You're
looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?"
"It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want
_yours_: I don't like them raw."
"Well, be off, then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,`,length:3756,num_lines:65,location:"A Thick Wood",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Trying to understand her transformation and defend herself against the Pigeon",importance:.9,emotion:"confused and defensive",sentiment:0,quote:"I'm _not_ a serpent!

she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. "Come, there's half my plan
done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm
going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
_is_ that to be done, I wonder?" As she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
"Whoever lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to come upon them
_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!" So she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.`,length:1178,num_lines:17,location:"W.

to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, "For the Duchess. An invitation from the
Queen to play croquet." The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, "From the Queen.
An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet."
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.`,length:1310,num_lines:20,location:"W.

"There's no sort of use in knocking," said the Footman, "and that for
two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you." And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary
noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.
"Please, then," said Alice, "how am I to get in?"
"There might be some sense in your knocking," the Footman went on
without attending to her, "if we had the door between us. For instance,
if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you
know." He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. "But perhaps he can't help it,"
she said to herself; "his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his
head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?"
she repeated, aloud.
"I shall sit here," the Footman remarked, "till tomorrow—"
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
"—or next day, maybe," the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.
"How am I to get in?" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.
"_Are_ you to get in at all?" said the Footman. "That's the first
question, you know."
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. "It's really
dreadful," she muttered to herself, "the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy!"
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. "I shall sit here," he said, "on and off, for
days and days."
"But what am _I_ to do?" said Alice.
"Anything you like," said the Footman, and began whistling.
"Oh, there's no use in talking to him," said Alice desperately: "he's
perfectly idiotic!" And she opened the door and went in.`,length:2080,num_lines:36,location:"W.

one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
"There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!" Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.
"Please would you tell me," said Alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, "why
your cat grins like that?"
"It's a Cheshire cat," said the Duchess, "and that's why. Pig!"
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—
"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't
know that cats _could_ grin."
"They all can," said the Duchess; "and most of 'em do."
"I don't know of any that do," Alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.
"You don't know much," said the Duchess; "and that's a fact."
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.
"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!" cried Alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. "Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!" as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.
"If everybody minded their own business," the Duchess said in a hoarse
growl, "the world would go round a deal faster than it does."
"Which would _not_ be an advantage," said Alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. "Just
think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—"
"Talking of axes," said the Duchess, "chop off her head!"
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: "Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or
is it twelve? I—"
"Oh, don't bother _me_," said the Duchess; "I never could abide
figures!" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:
"Speak roughly to your little boy,
And beat him when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
Because he knows it teases."
CHORUS.
(In which the cook and the baby joined):
"Wow! wow! wow!"
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words:—
"I speak severely to my boy,
I beat him when he sneezes;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases!"
CHORUS.
"Wow! wow! wow!"
"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!" the Duchess said to Alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. "I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen," and she hurried out of the room. The cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.`,length:3922,num_lines:71,location:"Duchess's Kitchen",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Curious and polite observer trying to engage in conversation",importance:.7,emotion:"Timid and anxious",sentiment:.2,quote:"Please would you tell me, why your cat grins like that?",importance_rank:2},{name:"Duchess",role:"Carefree and somewhat violent mother figure",importance:.8,emotion:"Indifferent and aggressive",sentiment:-.3,quote:"If everybody minded their own business, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.",importance_rank:1}],number:3,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Baby Turns into a Pig",summary:"The Duchess gives the baby to Alice, who takes it outside, where it gradually transforms into a pig.",chapter:"CHAPTER VI.",first_line:129,last_line:166,text:`Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
"just like a star-fish," thought Alice. The poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it
out into the open air. "If I don't take this child away with me,"
thought Alice, "they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be
murder to leave it behind?" She said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).
"Don't grunt," said Alice; "that's not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself."
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had
a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. "But perhaps it was only
sobbing," she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.
No, there were no tears. "If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,"
said Alice, seriously, "I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now!" The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, "Now, what am I to do
with this creature when I get it home?" when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time
there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. "If it had grown up," she said to
herself, "it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think." And she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, "if one only knew the right way to change them—" when she`,length:2457,num_lines:38,location:"A Thick Wood",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"trying to care for the strange baby and contemplating its future",importance:1,emotion:"conflicted and concerned",sentiment:.2,quote:"If I don't take this child away with me, they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?",importance_rank:1},{name:"The Baby",role:"a peculiar creature that Alice is trying to nurse",importance:.5,emotion:"confused and grunting",sentiment:-.1,quote:"*grunts*",importance_rank:2}],number:4,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Conversations with the Cheshire Cat",summary:"Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat multiple times, receiving cryptic directions and philosophical pronouncements.",chapter:"CHAPTER VI.",first_line:167,last_line:227,text:`was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.
"Cheshire Puss," she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. "Come, it's pleased so far," thought Alice, and she went on.
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where—" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
"—so long as I get _somewhere_," Alice added as an explanation.
"Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long
enough."
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. "What sort of people live about here?"
"In _that_ direction," the Cat said, waving its right paw round, "lives
a Hatter: and in _that_ direction," waving the other paw, "lives a
March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad."
"But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.
"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat: "we're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad."
"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice.
"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."
Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on "And how
do you know that you're mad?"
"To begin with," said the Cat, "a dog's not mad. You grant that?"
"I suppose so," said Alice.
"Well, then," the Cat went on, "you see, a dog growls when it's angry,
and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased,
and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad."
"_I_ call it purring, not growling," said Alice.
"Call it what you like," said the Cat. "Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?"
"I should like it very much," said Alice, "but I haven't been invited
yet."
"You'll see me there," said the Cat, and vanished.
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.
"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?" said the Cat. "I'd nearly
forgotten to ask."
"It turned into a pig," Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.
"I thought it would," said the Cat, and vanished again.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the March Hare was said to live. "I've seen hatters before," she
said to herself; "the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as it
was in March." As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
"Did you say pig, or fig?" said the Cat.
"I said pig," replied Alice; "and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy."
"All right," said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

"What day of the month
is it?" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.
Alice considered a little, and then said "The fourth."
"Two days wrong!" sighed the Hatter. "I told you butter wouldn't suit
the works!" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
"It was the _best_ butter," the March Hare meekly replied.
"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well," the Hatter grumbled:
"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife."
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, "It was the _best_ butter,
you know."
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. "What a
funny watch!" she remarked. "It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
tell what o'clock it is!"
"Why should it?" muttered the Hatter. "Does _your_ watch tell you what
year it is?"
"Of course not," Alice replied very readily: "but that's because it
stays the same year for such a long time together."
"Which is just the case with _mine_," said the Hatter.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. "I don't quite
understand you," she said, as politely as she could.
"The Dormouse is asleep again," said the Hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."
"Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice
again.
"No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what's the answer?"
"I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
"Nor I," said the March Hare.
Alice sighed wearily. "I think you might do something better with the
time," she said, "than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers."
"If you knew Time as well as I do," said the Hatter, "you wouldn't talk
about wasting _it_. It's _him_."
"I don't know what you mean," said Alice.
"Of course you don't!" the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. "I dare say you never even spoke to Time!"

growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, "Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me

their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,

turning to the rose-tree, she went on, "What _have_ you been doing
here?"
"May it please your Majesty," said Two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, "we were trying—"
"_I_ see!" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
"Off with their heads!" and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to Alice for protection.
"You shan't be beheaded!" said Alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.`,length:2229,num_lines:40,location:"The Queen's Croquet-ground",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"A brave and curious girl who stands up to the Queen",importance:1,emotion:"defiant and courageous",sentiment:.8,quote:"You shan't be beheaded!",importance_rank:1},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"The authoritative and temperamental ruler who demands obedience",importance:1,emotion:"furious and commanding",sentiment:-.8,quote:"Off with her head!",importance_rank:2},{name:"King Of Hearts",role:"The timid and gentle king who tries to protect Alice",importance:.7,emotion:"nervous and conciliatory",sentiment:.5,quote:"Consider, my dear: she is only a child!",importance_rank:3},{name:"Two",role:"One of the gardeners who is humbly trying to explain their actions",importance:.5,emotion:"humble and fearful",sentiment:-.5,quote:"May it please your Majesty.",importance_rank:4}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Off with Their Heads!",summary:"The Queen continues her tyrannical rule, ordering executions for those who displease her, even during the croquet game.",chapter:"CHAPTER VIII.",first_line:91,last_line:106,text:`"Are their heads off?" shouted the Queen.

other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting "Off with his head!" or "Off with her head!" about once in a
minute.
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
"and then," thought she, "what would become of me? They're dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any
one left alive!"
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself "It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk
to."`,length:2252,num_lines:35,location:"The Queen's Croquet-ground",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Trying to play croquet and manage the chaotic game",importance:1,emotion:"confused and amused",sentiment:.5,quote:"This is a very difficult game indeed.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"Angry and demanding beheadings during the game",importance:1,emotion:"furious",sentiment:-.8,quote:"Off with his head!",importance_rank:2},{name:"Cheshire Cat",role:"Appearing to Alice and providing a potential conversation partner",importance:.7,emotion:"mischievous",sentiment:.3,quote:"We're all mad here.",importance_rank:3}],number:6,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Conversation with the Cheshire Cat",summary:"Alice confides in the Cheshire Cat about the absurdity of the croquet game and her dislike of the Queen.",chapter:"CHAPTER VIII.",first_line:151,last_line:189,text:`"How are you getting on?" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. "It's no use
speaking to it," she thought, "till its ears have come, or at least one
of them." In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.
"I don't think they play at all fairly," Alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, "and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
oneself speak—and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you've no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the
arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground—and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!"
"How do you like the Queen?" said the Cat in a low voice.
"Not at all," said Alice: "she's so extremely—" Just then she noticed
that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
"—likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game."
The Queen smiled and passed on.
"Who _are_ you talking to?" said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.
"It's a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat," said Alice: "allow me to
introduce it."
"I don't like the look of it at all," said the King: "however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes."
"I'd rather not," the Cat remarked.
"Don't be impertinent," said the King, "and don't look at me like
that!" He got behind Alice as he spoke.
"A cat may look at a king," said Alice. "I've read that in some book,
but I don't remember where."
"Well, it must be removed," said the King very decidedly, and he called
the Queen, who was passing at the moment, "My dear! I wish you would
have this cat removed!"
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. "Off with his head!" she said, without even looking round.
"I'll fetch the executioner myself," said the King eagerly, and he
hurried off.`,length:2227,num_lines:39,location:"The Queen's Croquet-ground",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Expresses her frustrations about the croquet game and the Queen's unfairness",importance:1,emotion:"frustrated",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I don't think they play at all fairly.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Cheshire Cat",role:"Listens to Alice and engages in conversation about the Queen",importance:.8,emotion:"calm and mischievous",sentiment:.5,quote:"A cat may look at a king.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"Commands the removal of the Cheshire Cat",importance:.9,emotion:"authoritative",sentiment:-.7,quote:"Off with his head!",importance_rank:2},{name:"King Of Hearts",role:"Shows curiosity about the Cat and supports the Queen's command",importance:.7,emotion:"nervous",sentiment:-.3,quote:"I don't like the look of it at all.",importance_rank:4}],number:7,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:4},{title:"The King's Demand",summary:"The King, intimidated by the Cheshire Cat, demands its removal and orders the executioner to behead it.",chapter:"CHAPTER VIII.",first_line:190,last_line:206,text:`Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going

passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: "but it doesn't
matter much," thought Alice, "as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground." So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.`,length:1102,num_lines:17,location:"The Queen's Croquet-ground",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Alice is trying to navigate the chaotic croquet game and find her hedgehog to play with.",importance:.9,emotion:"frustrated and confused",sentiment:-.5,quote:"but it doesn't matter much, as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"The Queen is overseeing the game and is quick to sentence players to execution for mistakes.",importance:.8,emotion:"angry and passionate",sentiment:-.7,quote:"screaming with passion.",importance_rank:2},{name:"The Hedgehogs",role:"The hedgehogs are involved in a fight, which Alice sees as an opportunity for the game.",importance:.5,emotion:"aggressive",sentiment:-.2,quote:"engaged in a fight.",importance_rank:3}],number:8,importance_rank:8,conflict_rank:8},{title:"The Disappearing Cat",summary:"Alice returns to the croquet game, only to find the Cheshire Cat's head has vanished, leading to a dispute about its execution.",chapter:"CHAPTER VIII.",first_line:207,last_line:231,text:`When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.
The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life.
The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in
less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.)
Alice could think of nothing else to say but "It belongs to the
Duchess: you'd better ask _her_ about it."
"She's in prison," the Queen said to the executioner: "fetch her here."
And the executioner went off like an arrow.
The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.`,length:1526,num_lines:25,location:"Cheshire Cat",importance:.8,conflict:.9,characters:[{name:"Alice",role:"Mediator among the disputing characters",importance:.9,emotion:"Confused and overwhelmed",sentiment:0,quote:"It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask her about it.",importance_rank:1},{name:"The Executioner",role:"Argues against beheading without a body",importance:.7,emotion:"Defensive and reluctant",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I have never had to do such a thing before, and I wasn't going to begin at my time of life.",importance_rank:3},{name:"King Of Hearts",role:"Claims anything with a head can be beheaded",importance:.6,emotion:"Assertive and dismissive",sentiment:.2,quote:"You aren't to talk nonsense.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"Threatens execution if the issue isn't resolved",importance:.8,emotion:"Angry and demanding",sentiment:-.8,quote:"If something isn't done about it in less than no time, I'll have everybody executed.",importance_rank:2}],number:9,importance_rank:9,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Alice meets the Duchess",summary:"Alice meets the Duchess again, who is now in a pleasant mood, and they discuss the morals of various things.",chapter:"CHAPTER IX.",first_line:2,last_line:41,text:`"You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!"
said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's,
and they walked off together.
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.
"When _I'm_ a Duchess," she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
tone though), "I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
does very well without—Maybe it's always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered," she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, "and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be
so stingy about it, you know—"
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. "You're thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
a bit."
"Perhaps it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark.
"Tut, tut, child!" said the Duchess. "Everything's got a moral, if only
you can find it." And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
she spoke.
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.
"The game's going on rather better now," she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.
"'Tis so," said the Duchess: "and the moral of that is—'Oh, 'tis love,
'tis love, that makes the world go round!'"
"Somebody said," Alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding
their own business!"
"Ah, well! It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, "and the moral of
_that_ is—'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.'"

the Duchess said after a pause: "the reason is, that I'm doubtful about

"He might bite," Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.
"Very true," said the Duchess: "flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
the moral of that is—'Birds of a feather flock together.'"
"Only mustard isn't a bird," Alice remarked.
"Right, as usual," said the Duchess: "what a clear way you have of
putting things!"
"It's a mineral, I _think_," said Alice.
"Of course it is," said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that Alice said; "there's a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is—'The more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.'"
"Oh, I know!" exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, "it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is."
"I quite agree with you," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that
is—'Be what you would seem to be'—or if you'd like it put more
simply—'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.'"

"if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it."

in a pleased tone.

Alice.

of everything I've said as yet."

birthday presents like that!" But she did not venture to say it out
loud.
"Thinking again?" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

feel a little worried.

even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was

thunderstorm.
"A fine day, your Majesty!" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
"Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; "either you or your head must be off, and that in

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay
would cost them their lives.

with the other players, and shouting "Off with his head!" or "Off with

"I never saw one, or heard of one," said Alice.

to the company generally, "You are all pardoned." "Come, _that's_ a

with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

saying, "Thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not

"We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
angrily: "really you are very dull!"
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question," added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, "Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all
day about it!" and he went on in these words:
"Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it—"
"I never said I didn't!" interrupted Alice.
"You did," said the Mock Turtle.
"Hold your tongue!" added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
The Mock Turtle went on.
"We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—"
"_I've_ been to a day-school, too," said Alice; "you needn't be so
proud as all that."
"With extras?" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
"Yes," said Alice, "we learned French and music."
"And washing?" said the Mock Turtle.
"Certainly not!" said Alice indignantly.
"Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school," said the Mock Turtle in a
tone of great relief. "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
'French, music, _and washing_—extra.'"
"You couldn't have wanted it much," said Alice; "living at the bottom
of the sea."
"I couldn't afford to learn it." said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. "I
only took the regular course."
"What was that?" inquired Alice.
"Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with," the Mock Turtle
replied; "and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."
"I never heard of 'Uglification,'" Alice ventured to say. "What is it?"
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. "What! Never heard of
uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?"
"Yes," said Alice doubtfully: "it means—to—make—anything—prettier."
"Well, then," the Gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to uglify
is, you _are_ a simpleton."
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said "What else had you to learn?"
"Well, there was Mystery," the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, "—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils."
"What was _that_ like?" said Alice.
"Well, I can't show it you myself," the Mock Turtle said: "I'm too
stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it."
"Hadn't time," said the Gryphon: "I went to the Classics master,
though. He was an old crab, _he_ was."
"I never went to him," the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: "he taught
Laughing and Grief, they used to say."
"So he did, so he did," said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.
"And how many hours a day did you do lessons?" said Alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.
"Ten hours the first day," said the Mock Turtle: "nine the next, and so
on."
"What a curious plan!" exclaimed Alice.
"That's the reason they're called lessons," the Gryphon remarked:
"because they lessen from day to day."
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. "Then the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?"
"Of course it was," said the Mock Turtle.
"And how did you manage on the twelfth?" Alice went on eagerly.
"That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: "tell her something about the games now."`,length:4251,num_lines:78,location:"Under The Sea",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Mock Turtle",role:"Sharing his past experiences and education",importance:.7,emotion:"Nostalgic and sad",sentiment:.2,quote:"Once, I was a real Turtle.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Gryphon",role:"Encouraging the Mock Turtle to continue and interjecting",importance:.6,emotion:"Impatient and slightly condescending",sentiment:-.1,quote:"Drive on, old fellow!

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. "Same as if he had a bone in his throat,"
said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:—
"You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't," said
Alice)—"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—"
(Alice began to say "I once tasted—" but checked herself hastily, and
said "No, never") "—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
Lobster Quadrille is!"
"No, indeed," said Alice. "What sort of a dance is it?"
"Why," said the Gryphon, "you first form into a line along the
sea-shore—"
"Two lines!" cried the Mock Turtle. "Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—"
"_That_ generally takes some time," interrupted the Gryphon.
"—you advance twice—"
"Each with a lobster as a partner!" cried the Gryphon.
"Of course," the Mock Turtle said: "advance twice, set to partners—"
"—change lobsters, and retire in same order," continued the Gryphon.
"Then, you know," the Mock Turtle went on, "you throw the—"
"The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
"—as far out to sea as you can—"
"Swim after them!" screamed the Gryphon.
"Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
about.
"Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
"Back to land again, and that's all the first figure," said the Mock
Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.`,length:1841,num_lines:33,location:"Under The Sea",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Mock Turtle",role:"Explains the Lobster Quadrille dance and expresses sadness",importance:.7,emotion:"Melancholic",sentiment:-.5,quote:"You may not have lived much under the sea—",importance_rank:1},{name:"Gryphon",role:"Assists the Mock Turtle in explaining the dance and adds excitement",importance:.6,emotion:"Energetic",sentiment:.5,quote:"Change lobsters again!",importance_rank:2},{name:"Alice",role:"Inquisitive listener, trying to understand the dance",importance:.5,emotion:"Curious",sentiment:.2,quote:"What sort of a dance is it?",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Alice Watches the Lobster Quadrille",summary:"The Gryphon and Mock Turtle perform the Lobster Quadrille for Alice.",chapter:"CHAPTER X.",first_line:34,last_line:61,text:`"It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice timidly.

"Oh, _you_ sing," said the Gryphon. "I've forgotten the words."
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:—
"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.

"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be

But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

running on the song, "I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back,

saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating "_You are old, Father William_," to the
Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
Turtle drew a long breath, and said "That's very curious."
"It's all about as curious as it can be," said the Gryphon.
"It all came different!" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. "I
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
begin." He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over Alice.
"Stand up and repeat ''_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'" said the
Gryphon.
"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!"
thought Alice; "I might as well be at school at once." However, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:—
"'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes."

When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
"That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child," said
the Gryphon.
"Well, I never heard it before," said the Mock Turtle; "but it sounds
uncommon nonsense."
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.
"I should like to have it explained," said the Mock Turtle.
"She can't explain it," said the Gryphon hastily. "Go on with the next
verse."
"But about his toes?" the Mock Turtle persisted. "How _could_ he turn
them out with his nose, you know?"
"It's the first position in dancing." Alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
"Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon repeated impatiently: "it
begins '_I passed by his garden_.'"
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—
"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—"
[later editions continued as follows
The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.

Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:

And concluded the banquet—]
"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff," the Mock Turtle
interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the
most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!"

with sobs, to sing this:—

distance.

three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, "First witness!"
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. "I beg pardon, your
Majesty," he began, "for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished
my tea when I was sent for."
"You ought to have finished," said the King. "When did you begin?"
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. "Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it
was," he said.
"Fifteenth," said the March Hare.
"Sixteenth," added the Dormouse.
"Write that down," the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
"Take off your hat," the King said to the Hatter.
"It isn't mine," said the Hatter.
"_Stolen!_" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.
"I keep them to sell," the Hatter added as an explanation; "I've none
of my own. I'm a hatter."
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.
"Give your evidence," said the King; "and don't be nervous, or I'll
have you executed on the spot."
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.
"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so." said the Dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. "I can hardly breathe."
"I can't help it," said Alice very meekly: "I'm growing."
"You've no right to grow _here_," said the Dormouse.
"Don't talk nonsense," said Alice more boldly: "you know you're growing
too."
"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace," said the Dormouse: "not in
that ridiculous fashion." And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,
just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, "Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!"
on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.
"Give your evidence," the King repeated angrily, "or I'll have you
executed, whether you're nervous or not."
"I'm a poor man, your Majesty," the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
"—and I hadn't begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—"
"The twinkling of the _what?_" said the King.
"It _began_ with the tea," the Hatter replied.
"Of course twinkling begins with a T!" said the King sharply. "Do you
take me for a dunce? Go on!"
"I'm a poor man," the Hatter went on, "and most things twinkled after
that—only the March Hare said—"
"I didn't!" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.
"You did!" said the Hatter.
"I deny it!" said the March Hare.
"He denies it," said the King: "leave out that part."
"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—" the Hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.
"After that," continued the Hatter, "I cut some more bread-and-butter—"
"But what did the Dormouse say?" one of the jury asked.
"That I can't remember," said the Hatter.
"You _must_ remember," remarked the King, "or I'll have you executed."
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. "I'm a poor man, your Majesty," he began.
"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_," said the King.
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just
explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.)
"I'm glad I've seen that done," thought Alice. "I've so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court," and I never understood what it meant till now."
"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down," continued the
King.
"I can't go no lower," said the Hatter: "I'm on the floor, as it is."
"Then you may _sit_ down," the King replied.
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.
"Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!" thought Alice. "Now we shall get
on better."
"I'd rather finish my tea," said the Hatter, with an anxious look at
the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.
"You may go," said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.
"—and just take his head off outside," the Queen added to one of the
officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.`,length:5263,num_lines:96,location:"A Courtroom",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"King Of Hearts",role:"Presiding over the trial and questioning the witnesses",importance:.9,emotion:"impatient and authoritative",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Give your evidence, or I'll have you executed on the spot.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Hatter",role:"First witness, nervous and confused",importance:.8,emotion:"nervous and anxious",sentiment:-.6,quote:"I'm a poor man, your Majesty.",importance_rank:2},{name:"March Hare",role:"Supporting character, interjecting during the Hatter's testimony",importance:.6,emotion:"defensive and hurried",sentiment:-.2,quote:"I didn't!",importance_rank:4},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"Observing the trial and intimidating the witnesses",importance:.7,emotion:"stern and watchful",sentiment:-.7,quote:"Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!",importance_rank:3}],number:6,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:3},{title:"The Cook's Testimony",summary:"The Duchess's cook is called as a witness, but she refuses to give evidence and disappears amidst the chaos.",chapter:"CHAPTER XI.",first_line:154,last_line:172,text:`"Call the next witness!" said the King.
The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.
"Give your evidence," said the King.
"Shan't," said the cook.
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,
"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness."
"Well, if I must, I must," the King said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, "What are tarts made of?"
"Pepper, mostly," said the cook.
"Treacle," said a sleepy voice behind her.
"Collar that Dormouse," the Queen shrieked out. "Behead that Dormouse!
Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
whiskers!"
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.`,length:1028,num_lines:19,location:"A Courtroom",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"King Of Hearts",role:"Presiding over the court and trying to maintain order",importance:.7,emotion:"frustrated and melancholic",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Well, if I must, I must.",importance_rank:1},{name:"The Duchess's Cook",role:"Providing evidence but refusing to cooperate",importance:.6,emotion:"defiant",sentiment:-.3,quote:"Shan't.",importance_rank:2},{name:"White Rabbit",role:"Advising the King on how to handle the witness",importance:.5,emotion:"nervous",sentiment:-.2,quote:"Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Queen Of Hearts",role:"Demanding harsh punishment for the Dormouse",importance:.6,emotion:"angry and commanding",sentiment:-.7,quote:"Behead that Dormouse!",importance_rank:3},{name:"Dormouse",role:"Innocently interrupting the proceedings",importance:.4,emotion:"sleepy and confused",sentiment:-.1,quote:"Treacle.",importance_rank:5}],number:7,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Alice is Called",summary:"The King, tired of cross-examining, tells the Queen she must do it for the next witness, who turns out to be Alice.",chapter:"CHAPTER XI.",first_line:173,last_line:181,text:`"Never mind!" said the King, with an air of great relief.

very curious to see what the next witness would be like, "—for they

"Here!" cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.
"Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!" she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.
"The trial cannot proceed," said the King in a very grave voice, "until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_," he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon
got it out again, and put it right; "not that it signifies much," she
said to herself; "I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the
trial one way up as the other."
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the

he spoke.

"It must have been that," said the King, "unless it was written to
nobody, which isn't usual, you know."
"Who is it directed to?" said one of the jurymen.
"It isn't directed at all," said the White Rabbit; "in fact, there's
nothing written on the _outside_." He unfolded the paper as he spoke,

"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?" asked another of the jurymen.
"No, they're not," said the White Rabbit, "and that's the queerest
thing about it." (The jury all looked puzzled.)

all brightened up again.)

large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of
interrupting him,) "I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's

The jury all wrote down on their slates, "_She_ doesn't believe there's
an atom of meaning in it," but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.
"If there's no meaning in it," said the King, "that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't
know," he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; "I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.

to the Knave.
The Knave shook his head sadly. "Do I look like it?" he said. (Which he
certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)

verses to himself: "'_We know it to be true_—' that's the jury, of

did with the tarts, you know—"

tarts on the table. "Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then
again—'_before she had this fit_—' you never had fits, my dear, I
think?" he said to the Queen.
"Never!" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard
as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.)
"Then the words don't _fit_ you," said the King, looking round the
court with a smile. There was a dead silence.

could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtle's heavy sobs.`,length:1954,num_lines:31,location:"Wonderland",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Alice's Sister",role:"Reflecting on her sister's adventures and dreaming of Wonderland",importance:.7,emotion:"Nostalgic and contemplative",sentiment:.5,quote:"she too began dreaming after a fashion",importance_rank:1},{name:"Alice",role:"The subject of her sister's thoughts and dreams",importance:.6,emotion:"Adventurous and curious",sentiment:.7,quote:"the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers",importance_rank:2}],number:8,importance_rank:8,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Reflections on Childhood",summary:"Alice's sister imagines Alice growing up, cherishing her childhood memories and sharing them with future generations.",chapter:"CHAPTER XII.",first_line:204,last_line:212,text:`Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
