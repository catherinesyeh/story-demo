Uncle
Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their
house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one
room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for
the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry
and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in
another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a
small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family
could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to
crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the
middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark
hole.
When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see
nothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a
house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of
the sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a
gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was
not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until
they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had
been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it
away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.
When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun
and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes
and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and
lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled
now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had
been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and
press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached
her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she
could find anything to laugh at.
Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and
did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his
rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.
It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray
as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black
dog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on
either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and
Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.`,length:2587,num_lines:39,location:"Kansas Prairies",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"An orphan living with her relatives, seeking joy in her surroundings",importance:.9,emotion:"Curious and playful",sentiment:.7,quote:"Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long silky hair.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Aunt Em",role:"Dorothy's aunt, worn down by life, struggles to find joy",importance:.7,emotion:"Sober and weary",sentiment:-.5,quote:"She had taken the sparkle from her eyes.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Uncle Henry",role:"Dorothy's uncle, a hard-working farmer, lacks joy",importance:.6,emotion:"Stern and solemn",sentiment:-.4,quote:"He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Toto",role:"Dorothy's pet dog, brings joy and laughter to her life",importance:.8,emotion:"Playful and lively",sentiment:.9,quote:"Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:5},{title:"The Coming Storm",summary:"Uncle Henry and Dorothy notice signs of an approaching cyclone.",chapter:"Chapter I The Cyclone",first_line:40,last_line:52,text:`Today, however, they were not playing.

the sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.
From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry
and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the
coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the
south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the
grass coming from that direction also.
Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.

and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down
suddenly upon the floor.
Then a strange thing happened.
The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the
air. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.
The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the
exact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is
generally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of
the house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top
of the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles
away as easily as you could carry a feather.`,length:710,num_lines:12,location:"Dorothy's House In A Cyclone",importance:1,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Experiencing the cyclone and feeling fear and wonder",importance:1,emotion:"A mix of fear and awe",sentiment:0,quote:"I felt as if I were going up in a balloon.",importance_rank:1}],number:4,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Adrift in the Cyclone",summary:"Dorothy and Toto ride out the cyclone inside the house as it's carried away.",chapter:"Chapter I The Cyclone",first_line:72,last_line:94,text:`It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy
found she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,
and one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were
being rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.
Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,
barking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to
see what would happen.
Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first
the little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his
ears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air
was keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,
caught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward
closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.
Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;
but she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about
her that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would
be dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed
and nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to
wait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled
over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto
followed and lay down beside her.
In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,
Dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.`,length:1464,num_lines:23,location:"Dorothy's House In A Cyclone",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Calmly waits for the storm to pass",importance:.9,emotion:"Anxious but determined",sentiment:.2,quote:"I will wait calmly and see what the future will bring.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Toto",role:"Barks and runs around in fear",importance:.5,emotion:"Fearful and restless",sentiment:-.3,quote:"Bark!

up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the
bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She
sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.
The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes
growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.
The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the
midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of
greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious
fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with
rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.
A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between
green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl
who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.`,length:1158,num_lines:17,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Exploring her new environment",importance:.9,emotion:"Amazed and curious",sentiment:.8,quote:"What a wonderful place this is!",importance_rank:1}],number:1,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:6},{title:"Meeting the Munchkins",summary:"Dorothy encounters a group of strange little people called Munchkins who are grateful to her.",chapter:"Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins",first_line:18,last_line:47,text:`While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,
she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had
ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been
used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about
as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although
they were, so far as looks go, many years older.
Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore
round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with
little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The
hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she
wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were
sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men
were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore
well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,
Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had
beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was
covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather
stiffly.
When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the
doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to
come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low
bow and said, in a sweet voice:
"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.
We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the
East, and for setting our people free from bondage."
Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little
woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had
killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless
little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;
and she had never killed anything in all her life.`,length:1928,num_lines:30,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Innocent girl confused by praise",importance:.8,emotion:"Surprised and bewildered",sentiment:.2,quote:"What could the little woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Witch Of The North",role:"Grateful for Dorothy's actions",importance:.7,emotion:"Joyful and respectful",sentiment:.8,quote:"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:4},{title:"The Wicked Witch of the East is Dead",summary:"The Munchkins reveal that Dorothy's house has landed on and killed the Wicked Witch of the East.",chapter:"Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins",first_line:48,last_line:65,text:`But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,

corner of the house. "There are her two feet, still sticking out from
under a block of wood."
Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just
under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were
sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.
"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in
dismay. "The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?"
"There is nothing to be done," said the little woman calmly.
"But who was she?" asked Dorothy.
"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said," answered the little
woman. "She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,

"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked
Witch ruled."
"Are you a Munchkin?" asked Dorothy.
"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.
When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift
messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North."
"Oh, gracious!" cried Dorothy. "Are you a real witch?"
"Yes, indeed," answered the little woman. "But I am a good witch, and
the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who
ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself."
"But I thought all witches were wicked," said the girl, who was half
frightened at facing a real witch. "Oh, no, that is a great mistake.
There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,
those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know
this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.
Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;
but now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch
in all the Land of Oz—the one who lives in the West."
"But," said Dorothy, after a moment's thought, "Aunt Em has told me
that the witches were all dead—years and years ago."
"Who is Aunt Em?" inquired the little old woman.
"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from."
The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed
and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, "I do not
know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned
before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?"
"Oh, yes," replied Dorothy.
"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there
are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,
you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off
from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and
wizards amongst us."
"Who are the wizards?" asked Dorothy.
"Oz himself is the Great Wizard," answered the Witch, sinking her voice
to a whisper. "He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He
lives in the City of Emeralds."`,length:2191,num_lines:37,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Curious about the witches",importance:.7,emotion:"Curious and slightly frightened",sentiment:.2,quote:"Are you a real witch?",importance_rank:2},{name:"Witch Of The North",role:"Explains the nature of witches",importance:.8,emotion:"Calm and informative",sentiment:.5,quote:"Yes, indeed, I am a good witch.",importance_rank:1}],number:4,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:5},{title:"The Silver Shoes",summary:"The Witch of the North gives Dorothy the Wicked Witch of the East's magical silver shoes.",chapter:"Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins",first_line:103,last_line:116,text:`Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,

"What is it?" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to
laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing
was left but the silver shoes.
"She was so old," explained the Witch of the North, "that she dried up
quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are
yours, and you shall have them to wear." She reached down and picked up
the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to

strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,
for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep
also. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced
the point on the end of her nose, while she counted "One, two, three"
in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was
written in big, white chalk marks:
"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS"
The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the
words on it, asked, "Is your name Dorothy, my dear?"
"Yes," answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.
"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you."
"Where is this city?" asked Dorothy.
"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the
Great Wizard I told you of."
"Is he a good man?" inquired the girl anxiously.
"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I
have never seen him."
"How can I get there?" asked Dorothy.
"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is
sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use
all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm."
"Won't you go with me?" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon
the little old woman as her only friend.
"No, I cannot do that," she replied, "but I will give you my kiss, and
no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of
the North."
She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where
her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy
found out soon after.
"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick," said the
Witch, "so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of
him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear."
The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,
after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy
a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and
straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who
barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been
afraid even to growl while she stood by.

in just that way, and was not surprised in the least.`,length:2397,num_lines:41,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Feeling lonely and seeking help",importance:.9,emotion:"sad and hopeful",sentiment:.2,quote:"Is he a good man?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Witch Of The North",role:"Guiding Dorothy to Emerald City",importance:.8,emotion:"kind and reassuring",sentiment:.7,quote:"I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.",importance_rank:2}],number:7,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Preparing for the Journey",summary:"Dorothy eats, packs, and gets ready to leave for the Emerald City.",chapter:"Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",first_line:1,last_line:22,text:`When Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry.

the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.
She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it
down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.
Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting
there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging
from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what
she wanted to help out her breakfast.
Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to
a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for
the journey to the City of Emeralds.
Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was
hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white
and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,
it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed
herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.
She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,
laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and
noticed how old and worn her shoes were.
"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto," she said. And

briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on
the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang
sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a
little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own
country and set down in the midst of a strange land.
She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country
was about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted
a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and
vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and
able to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and
the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for
everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and
setting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were
odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.
All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the
favorite color.`,length:1169,num_lines:18,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Walking toward the Emerald City, feeling optimistic",importance:.9,emotion:"Curious and hopeful",sentiment:.7,quote:"I didn't feel nearly so bad as you might think.",importance_rank:1}],number:4,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Hospitality of Boq",summary:"Dorothy is welcomed by a wealthy Munchkin named Boq and spends the night at his house.",chapter:"Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",first_line:53,last_line:88,text:`Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to
wonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather
larger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women
were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and
the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was
loaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other
good things to eat.
The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to
pass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest
Munchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to
celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.
Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin
himself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the
people dance.
When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, "You must be a great sorceress."
"Why?" asked the girl.
"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.
Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses
wear white."
"My dress is blue and white checked," said Dorothy, smoothing out the
wrinkles in it.
"It is kind of you to wear that," said Boq. "Blue is the color of the
Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly
witch."
Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to
think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary
little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange
land.
When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,
where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made
of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with
Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.
She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played
with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that
greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,
for they had never seen a dog before.`,length:2041,num_lines:36,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"A young girl exploring a new land",importance:.9,emotion:"curious and slightly confused",sentiment:.5,quote:"My dress is blue and white checked.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Boq",role:"A rich Munchkin hosting a celebration",importance:.7,emotion:"friendly and welcoming",sentiment:.8,quote:"You must be a great sorceress.",importance_rank:2}],number:5,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:8},{title:"Warnings and Farewell",summary:"Boq warns Dorothy about the dangers of Oz, but she remains resolute and continues her journey.",chapter:"Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",first_line:89,last_line:101,text:`"How far is it to the Emerald City?" the girl asked.

is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business
with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take
you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass
through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your
journey."
This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz
could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn
back.
She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of
yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would
stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road`,length:761,num_lines:13,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.4,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Determined to reach Oz for help",importance:.9,emotion:"Brave but worried",sentiment:.5,quote:"I must reach the Emerald City.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Boq",role:"Cautioning Dorothy about the journey",importance:.7,emotion:"Serious and concerned",sentiment:.3,quote:"It is better for people to keep away from Oz.",importance_rank:2}],number:6,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Meeting the Scarecrow",summary:"Dorothy encounters a Scarecrow and is surprised to find that he can talk.",chapter:"Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",first_line:102,last_line:120,text:`and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far
away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from
the ripe corn.
Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the
Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,
nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue
hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and
the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,
which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots
with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure
was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its
back.
While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the
Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.
She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the
scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its
head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and
walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.
"Good day," said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.`,length:1188,num_lines:19,location:"Cornfield",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"gazes thoughtfully at the Scarecrow",importance:.7,emotion:"curious and surprised",sentiment:.5,quote:"I thought I must have been mistaken at first.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"greets Dorothy and interacts with her",importance:.6,emotion:"friendly and welcoming",sentiment:.6,quote:"Good day.",importance_rank:2}],number:7,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:9},{title:"The Scarecrow's Desire",summary:"The Scarecrow reveals his desire for brains and asks to join Dorothy on her journey to the Emerald City.",chapter:"Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",first_line:121,last_line:161,text:`"Did you speak?" asked the girl, in wonder.
"Certainly," answered the Scarecrow. "How do you do?"
"I'm pretty well, thank you," replied Dorothy politely. "How do you
do?"
"I'm not feeling well," said the Scarecrow, with a smile, "for it is
very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows."
"Can't you get down?" asked Dorothy.
"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away
the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you."
Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,
being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.
"Thank you very much," said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on
the ground. "I feel like a new man."
Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man
speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.
"Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and
yawned. "And where are you going?"
"My name is Dorothy," said the girl, "and I am going to the Emerald
City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas."
"Where is the Emerald City?" he inquired. "And who is Oz?"
"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise.
"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no
brains at all," he answered sadly.
"Oh," said Dorothy, "I'm awfully sorry for you."
"Do you think," he asked, "if I go to the Emerald City with you, that
Oz would give me some brains?"
"I cannot tell," she returned, "but you may come with me, if you like.
If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you
are now."
"That is true," said the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued
confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,
because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin
into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want
people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw
instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?"
"I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who was truly sorry
for him. "If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for
you."
"Thank you," he answered gratefully.

The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:
"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was
only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that
time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one
of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what
was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing
I heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'
"'They aren't straight,'" answered the other.
"'Never mind,'" said the farmer. "'They are ears just the same,'" which
was true enough.
"'Now I'll make the eyes,'" said the farmer. So he painted my right
eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and
at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my
first glimpse of the world.
"'That's a rather pretty eye,'" remarked the Munchkin who was watching
the farmer. "'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'
"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'" said the farmer. And
when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then
he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time
I didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make
my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at
last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as
anyone.
"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He
looks just like a man.'
"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The
farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a
tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked
away and left me alone.
"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.
But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on
that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,
having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds
flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away
again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel
that I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near
me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and
said:
"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any
crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he
hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,
seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short
time there was a great flock of them about me.
"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow
after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had
brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a
better man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having
in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'
"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try
hard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off
the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me
brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City."`,length:3279,num_lines:53,location:"Cornfield",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Tells the child about his creation and desire for brains",importance:1,emotion:"Reflective and hopeful",sentiment:.5,quote:"If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Child",role:"Asks the Scarecrow for a story",importance:.5,emotion:"Curious and innocent",sentiment:.7,quote:"Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Continuing the Journey",summary:"Dorothy and the Scarecrow continue their journey, entering a dark forest.",chapter:"Chapter IV The Road Through the Forest",first_line:91,last_line:108,text:`"I hope so," said Dorothy earnestly, "since you seem anxious to have

"Oh, yes; I am anxious," returned the Scarecrow. "It is such an
uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool."
"Well," said the girl, "let us go." And she handed the basket to the
Scarecrow.
There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough
and untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the
trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the
road of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the
branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and
went on into the forest.
"If this road goes in, it must come out," said the Scarecrow, "and as
the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever
it leads us."
"Anyone would know that," said Dorothy.
"Certainly; that is why I know it," returned the Scarecrow. "If it

stumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto
could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow

and managed to get along fairly well.
"If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night," she
said, "you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the
dark."
Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.
"I see a little cottage at the right of us," he said, "built of logs
and branches. Shall we go there?"
"Yes, indeed," answered the child. "I am all tired out."
So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the
cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one
corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a
sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another

"Why do you want water?" he asked.
"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the
dry bread will not stick in my throat."
"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the Scarecrow
thoughtfully, "for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have
brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly."
They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a
little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate
her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and

yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.
"What was that?" she asked timidly.
"I cannot imagine," replied the Scarecrow; "but we can go and see."
Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to
come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few
steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine
that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped
short, with a little cry of surprise.
One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing
beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely
of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he
stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.
Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while
Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his
teeth.
"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.
"Yes," answered the tin man, "I did. I've been groaning for more than a
year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."
"What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the
sad voice in which the man spoke.
"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered. "They are rusted so
badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon
be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."
Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then
she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"
"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as
it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and
moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the
man could turn it himself.
"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled them and
the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust
and as good as new.
The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which
he leaned against the tree.
"This is a great comfort," he said. "I have been holding that axe in
the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at
last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right
once more."
So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked
them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite
creature, and very grateful.`,length:2461,num_lines:42,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Helps the Tin Woodman by oiling his joints",importance:.9,emotion:"Compassionate and curious",sentiment:.8,quote:"What can I do for you?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Assists Dorothy in helping the Tin Woodman",importance:.7,emotion:"Supportive and helpful",sentiment:.7,quote:"We can go and see.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Seeks help to move after being rusted",importance:.9,emotion:"Grateful and relieved",sentiment:.9,quote:"This is a great comfort.",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Tin Woodman's Request",summary:"The Tin Woodman asks to join Dorothy on her journey to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard for a heart.",chapter:"Chapter V The Rescue of the Tin Woodman",first_line:59,last_line:78,text:`"I might have stood there always if you had not come along," he said;

"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz," she
answered, "and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night."
"Why do you wish to see Oz?" he asked.
"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to
put a few brains into his head," she replied.
The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:
"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?"
"Why, I guess so," Dorothy answered. "It would be as easy as to give
the Scarecrow brains."
"True," the Tin Woodman returned. "So, if you will allow me to join
your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me."
"Come along," said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she
would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his
axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road
that was paved with yellow brick.

the following story:
"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest
and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a
woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as
long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone
I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.
"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon
grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry
me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for
her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old
woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she
wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the
housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and
promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.
Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping
away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my
wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my
left leg.
"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man
could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and
had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I
was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for
she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin
girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right
leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of
tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;
but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked
Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I
thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come
along, and he made me a new head out of tin.
"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than
ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a
new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my
axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into
two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body
of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of
joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had
now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did
not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living
with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.
"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and
it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There
was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in
my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,
there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a
rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I
was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a
terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time
to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.
While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can
love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me
one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her."`,length:3514,num_lines:53,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Tells his backstory and desire for a heart",importance:1,emotion:"Nostalgic and regretful",sentiment:-.5,quote:"the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.",importance_rank:1}],number:6,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Dorothy's Worry",summary:"Dorothy listens to her friends' debate and worries about their dwindling food supply.",chapter:"Chapter V The Rescue of the Tin Woodman",first_line:154,last_line:169,text:`Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story

one."
"I shall take the heart," returned the Tin Woodman; "for brains do not
make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world."
Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her
two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to
Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had
no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.
What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another
meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither

open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there
came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These
sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know
what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side,
and did not even bark in return.

City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it
was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the

next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his
paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the
road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,
to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,
although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.
Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the
Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when
Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed
forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while
she cried out:
"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a
big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!"
"I didn't bite him," said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw
where Dorothy had hit it.
"No, but you tried to," she retorted. "You are nothing but a big
coward."
"I know it," said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. "I've always
known it. But how can I help it?"
"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like
the poor Scarecrow!"

the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into
shape again.
"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was still angry.
"That's why he went over so easily," remarked the Lion. "It astonished
me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?"
"No," said Dorothy, "he's made of tin." And she helped the Woodman up
again.
"That's why he nearly blunted my claws," said the Lion. "When they
scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What
is that little animal you are so tender of?"
"He is my dog, Toto," answered Dorothy.
"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?" asked the Lion.
"Neither. He's a—a—a meat dog," said the girl.
"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look
at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a
coward like me," continued the Lion sadly.
"What makes you a coward?" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in
wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.
"It's a mystery," replied the Lion. "I suppose I was born that way. All
the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for
the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that
if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out
of my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just
roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If
the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,
I should have run myself—I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they
hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them

"I know it," returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip
of his tail. "It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.
But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast."
"Perhaps you have heart disease," said the Tin Woodman.
"It may be," said the Lion.
"If you have," continued the Tin Woodman, "you ought to be glad, for it
proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have
heart disease."
"Perhaps," said the Lion thoughtfully, "if I had no heart I should not
be a coward."
"Have you brains?" asked the Scarecrow.
"I suppose so. I've never looked to see," replied the Lion.
"I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some," remarked the
Scarecrow, "for my head is stuffed with straw."
"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart," said the Woodman.
"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas," added
Dorothy.
"Do you think Oz could give me courage?" asked the Cowardly Lion.
"Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the Scarecrow.
"Or give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.
"Or send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.
"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you," said the Lion, "for my
life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage."
"You will be very welcome," answered Dorothy, "for you will help to
keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more
cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily."
"They really are," said the Lion, "but that doesn't make me any braver,
and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy."
So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion
walking with stately strides at Dorothy's side. Toto did not approve of
this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had
been crushed between the Lion's great jaws. But after a time he became

peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a
beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little
thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always
careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept
several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his
face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When
Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open
his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly
frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but
she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was
wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and
oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as
well as before.
"This will serve me a lesson," said he, "to look where I step. For if I
should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying
rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak."
Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and
when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to
harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore
he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.
"You people with hearts," he said, "have something to guide you, and
need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very
careful.

forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick
covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a
great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that
warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of
their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.
"If you wish," said the Lion, "I will go into the forest and kill a
deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so
peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very
good breakfast."
"Don't! Please don't," begged the Tin Woodman. "I should certainly weep
if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again."
But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no
one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow
found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so
that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very
kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the
awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded
hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost
as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how
long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away
from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn
him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came
near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These
kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.

They had hardly been
walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed
the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either
side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and
looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were
many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none
of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey
must end.
"What shall we do?" asked Dorothy despairingly.
"I haven't the faintest idea," said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook
his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.
But the Scarecrow said, "We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we
climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,
we must stop where we are."
"I think I could jump over it," said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring
the distance carefully in his mind.
"Then we are all right," answered the Scarecrow, "for you can carry us
all over on your back, one at a time."
"Well, I'll try it," said the Lion. "Who will go first?"
"I will," declared the Scarecrow, "for, if you found that you could not
jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly
dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter
so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all."
"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself," said the Cowardly Lion, "but
I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we
will make the attempt."
The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the
edge of the gulf and crouched down.
"Why don't you run and jump?" asked the Scarecrow.
"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things," he replied. Then
giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the
other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,
and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang
across the ditch again.
Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and
climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.
The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and
then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other
side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then
they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,
for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big
dog that has been running too long.`,length:2529,num_lines:42,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"expresses despair and concern",importance:.7,emotion:"worried and anxious",sentiment:-.5,quote:"What shall we do?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"uncertain and thoughtful",importance:.5,emotion:"confused",sentiment:-.3,quote:"I haven't the faintest idea.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Lion",role:"measures the jump and carries others",importance:.6,emotion:"nervous but determined",sentiment:.2,quote:"I think I could jump over it.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"suggests a plan and goes first",importance:.6,emotion:"calm and logical",sentiment:.5,quote:"Then we are all right.",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Encounter with the Kalidahs",summary:"The group faces the dangerous Kalidahs and narrowly escapes by chopping down a tree bridge.",chapter:"Chapter VII The Journey to the Great Oz",first_line:70,last_line:129,text:`They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and
gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow
brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would
come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To
add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths
of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part
of the country that the Kalidahs lived.
"What are the Kalidahs?" asked the girl.
"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like
tigers," replied the Lion, "and with claws so long and sharp that they
could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly
afraid of the Kalidahs."
"I'm not surprised that you are," returned Dorothy. "They must be
dreadful beasts."
The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf
across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew
at once he could not leap across it.
So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious
thought the Scarecrow said:
"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman
can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk
across it easily."
"That is a first-rate idea," said the Lion. "One would almost suspect
you had brains in your head, instead of straw."
The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree
was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front
legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big
tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top
branches on the other side.
They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl
made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them
two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.
"They are the Kalidahs!" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.
"Quick!" cried the Scarecrow. "Let us cross over."
So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman
followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was
certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud
and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over
backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him
in surprise.
But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there
were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed
forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they
would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began
to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:
"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp
claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am
alive."
"Wait a minute!" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was
best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of
the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began
to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly
across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,
snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp
rocks at the bottom.
"Well," said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, "I see
we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it
must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures
frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet."

the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had
to ride on the Lion's back. To their great joy the trees became thinner
the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon
a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of
the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a
beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and
all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They
were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.
"How shall we cross the river?" asked Dorothy.
"That is easily done," replied the Scarecrow. "The Tin Woodman must
build us a raft, so we can float to the other side."
So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make
a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the
riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had
eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe
fruit.
But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and
untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.

seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.
To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.
But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few
more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready
to start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in
her arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,

farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep
that the long poles would not touch the bottom.
"This is bad," said the Tin Woodman, "for if we cannot get to the land
we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,
and she will enchant us and make us her slaves."
"And then I should get no brains," said the Scarecrow.

"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can," the Scarecrow
continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in
the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out
again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was
left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.
"Good-bye!" he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave
him. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered
that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.
Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.
"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy," he thought. "Then,
I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare
the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow

his tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the
shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they
were drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's
long pole and helped push the raft to the land.

road again," remarked the Lion.
So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they
started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had
carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit
trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for
the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.
They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to
pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:
"Look!"

The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.
So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow
until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the
water's edge.
"Who are you and where are you going?" asked the Stork.
"I am Dorothy," answered the girl, "and these are my friends, the Tin
Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City."
"This isn't the road," said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and
looked sharply at the queer party.
"I know it," returned Dorothy, "but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are
wondering how we shall get him again."
"Where is he?" asked the Stork.
"Over there in the river," answered the little girl.
"If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you," remarked the
Stork.
"He isn't heavy a bit," said Dorothy eagerly, "for he is stuffed with
straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever
and ever so much."
"Well, I'll try," said the Stork, "but if I find he is too heavy to
carry I shall have to drop him in the river again."
So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to
where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her
great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into
the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin
Woodman and Toto were sitting.
When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so
happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they
walked along he sang "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt so gay.
"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever," he said,
"but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find
the Stork again and do her some kindness in return."
"That's all right," said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.
"I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my
babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald
City and that Oz will help you."
"Thank you," replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air

birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that
the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and
blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,
which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.
"Aren't they beautiful?" the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy
scent of the bright flowers.
"I suppose so," answered the Scarecrow. "When I have brains, I shall
probably like them better."
"If I only had a heart, I should love them," added the Tin Woodman.
"I always did like flowers," said the Lion. "They seem so helpless and
frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these."
They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer
and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the
midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when
there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that
anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried
away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But
Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red
flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy
and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.
But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.
"We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,"
he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until
Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and
she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.
"What shall we do?" asked the Tin Woodman.
"If we leave her here she will die," said the Lion. "The smell of the
flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and
the dog is asleep already."
It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not
troubled by the scent of the flowers.
"Run fast," said the Scarecrow to the Lion, "and get out of this deadly
flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,
but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried."
So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.
In a moment he was out of sight.
"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her," said the Scarecrow.

flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of
the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast
asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge
beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance
from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in
beautiful green fields before them.
"We can do nothing for him," said the Tin Woodman, sadly; "for he is
much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and
perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last."
"I'm sorry," said the Scarecrow. "The Lion was a very good comrade for
one so cowardly. But let us go on."
They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far
enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the
poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass
and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.`,length:1007,num_lines:16,location:"Meadow Of Poppies",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Expresses sadness over Lion's condition",importance:.7,emotion:"sadness and concern",sentiment:-.5,quote:"We can do nothing for him.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Reflects on Lion's bravery and suggests moving on",importance:.6,emotion:"sorrowful acceptance",sentiment:-.4,quote:"The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly.",importance_rank:2}],number:7,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Wildcat Attack",summary:"The Tin Woodman saves the Queen of the Field Mice from a Wildcat.",chapter:"Chapter IX The Queen of the Field Mice",first_line:4,last_line:36,text:`The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and
turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange
beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great
yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,
for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,
showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of
fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the
beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he
knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,
harmless creature.
So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a
quick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it
rolled over at his feet in two pieces.
The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;
and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:
"Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life."
"Don't speak of it, I beg of you," replied the Woodman. "I have no
heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a
friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse."
"Only a mouse!" cried the little animal, indignantly. "Why, I am a
Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!"
"Oh, indeed," said the Woodman, making a bow.
"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in
saving my life," added the Queen.
At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their
little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they
exclaimed:
"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage
to escape the great Wildcat?" They all bowed so low to the little Queen
that they almost stood upon their heads.
"This funny tin man," she answered, "killed the Wildcat and saved my
life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest
wish."`,length:1922,num_lines:33,location:"Meadow Of Poppies",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Saves the field mouse from the Wildcat",importance:1,emotion:"Determined and noble",sentiment:1,quote:"I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Field Mouse Queen",role:"Expresses gratitude and reveals her identity",importance:1,emotion:"Grateful and proud",sentiment:1,quote:"Thank you ever so much for saving my life.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Toto and the Mice",summary:"The field mice, frightened by Toto, scatter but are reassured by the Tin Woodman.",chapter:"Chapter IX The Queen of the Field Mice",first_line:37,last_line:54,text:`"We will!" cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they
scampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and
seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped
right into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice
when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.
But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,
while he called to the mice, "Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt
you."
At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a
clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, "Are you sure he will not
bite us?"
"I will not let him," said the Woodman; "so do not be afraid."
One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,
although he tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have
bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one
of the biggest mice spoke.

had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed
with straw, said, quickly, "Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the
Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed."
"A Lion!" cried the little Queen. "Why, he would eat us all up."
"Oh, no," declared the Scarecrow; "this Lion is a coward."
"Really?" asked the Mouse.
"He says so himself," answered the Scarecrow, "and he would never hurt
anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise
that he shall treat you all with kindness."
"Very well," said the Queen, "we trust you. But what shall we do?"
"Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to
obey you?"
"Oh, yes; there are thousands," she replied.
"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each
one bring a long piece of string."
The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at
once and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran
away in every direction as fast as possible.
"Now," said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, "you must go to those
trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion."
So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon
made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all
the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and
made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast
and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the
truck was all ready for them.
They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big
mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a
piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke
from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to
find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing
around and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about
everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:
"Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen."
Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she
became quite friendly with the little girl.
The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the
truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied
around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course
the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to
draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to
pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit
on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place
where the Lion lay asleep.
After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed
to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people
the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies
too long they also would fall asleep.
At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir
the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed
from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out
of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,
fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.
Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving
her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was
glad he had been rescued.
Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away
through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to
leave.
"If ever you need us again," she said, "come out into the field and
call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!"
"Good-bye!" they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy
held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.`,length:3938,num_lines:64,location:"Meadow Of Poppies",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Suggests saving the Lion",importance:.8,emotion:"determined",sentiment:.7,quote:"Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Builds a truck for the Lion",importance:.7,emotion:"focused",sentiment:.6,quote:"So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Field Mouse Queen",role:"Leads the mice to help",importance:.7,emotion:"trusting",sentiment:.5,quote:"Very well, we trust you.

evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of

to the door and knocked.
A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, "What do you
want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?"
"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us," answered
Dorothy; "and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you
for the world."
"Is he tame?" asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.
"Oh, yes," said the girl, "and he is a great coward, too. He will be
more afraid of you than you are of him."
"Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep
at the Lion, "if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you
some supper and a place to sleep."
So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two
children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the
couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a
company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:
"Where are you all going?"
"To the Emerald City," said Dorothy, "to see the Great Oz."
"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed the man. "Are you sure that Oz will see you?"
"Why not?" she replied.
"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I
have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and
wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,
nor do I know of any living person who has seen him."
"Does he never go out?" asked the Scarecrow.
"Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,
and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face."
"What is he like?" asked the girl.
"That is hard to tell," said the man thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is a
Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he
looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say
he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a
brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,
when he is in his own form, no living person can tell."
"That is very strange," said Dorothy, "but we must try, in some way, to
see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing."
"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?" asked the man.
"I want him to give me some brains," said the Scarecrow eagerly.
"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough," declared the man. "He has more
brains than he needs."
"And I want him to give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.
"That will not trouble him," continued the man, "for Oz has a large
collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes."
"And I want him to give me courage," said the Cowardly Lion.
"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room," said the man,
"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running
over. He will be glad to give you some."
"And I want him to send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.
"Where is Kansas?" asked the man, with surprise.
"I don't know," replied Dorothy sorrowfully, "but it is my home, and
I'm sure it's somewhere."
"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find
Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a
hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he
usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?" he continued, speaking

speak.`,length:3374,num_lines:58,location:"Beautiful Country Of The Quadlings",importance:.8,conflict:.4,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"seeking help from Oz",importance:1,emotion:"determined",sentiment:.7,quote:"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Lion",role:"accompanying Dorothy",importance:.8,emotion:"nervous",sentiment:.5,quote:"He will be more afraid of you than you are of him.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"curious about Oz",importance:.7,emotion:"inquisitive",sentiment:.6,quote:"What is he like?",importance_rank:4},{name:"The Little Man",role:"informing Dorothy about Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"cautious",sentiment:.4,quote:"Are you sure that Oz will see you?",importance_rank:2},{name:"Witch Of The North",role:"host offering shelter",importance:.6,emotion:"welcoming",sentiment:.8,quote:"if that is the case you may come in.",importance_rank:5}],number:4,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Supper and Rest",summary:"The group enjoys a meal provided by the farm woman, with Dorothy and Toto receiving a place to sleep for the night.",chapter:"Chapter X The Guardian of the Gates",first_line:99,last_line:109,text:`The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered

gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even

was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin
was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.
When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, "What do you wish
in the Emerald City?"
"We came here to see the Great Oz," said Dorothy.
The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it
over.
"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz," he said,
shaking his head in perplexity. "He is powerful and terrible, and if
you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of
the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant."
"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied the
Scarecrow; "it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good
Wizard."
"So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the Emerald City wisely
and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from
curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his
face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the
Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the
spectacles."
"Why?" asked Dorothy.
"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the
Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear
spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it
when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock
them."
He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with
spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in
them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit
Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands
fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they
were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the
Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy
could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish
to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.
Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin
Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast
with the key.`,length:2285,num_lines:39,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Wants to see the Great Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"determined",sentiment:.7,quote:"We came here to see the Great Oz.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Supports Dorothy's quest",importance:.8,emotion:"confident",sentiment:.6,quote:"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Guardian Of The Gates",role:"Explains the rules of seeing Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"perplexed",sentiment:.2,quote:"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz.",importance_rank:2}],number:7,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Entering the Emerald City",summary:"The Guardian of the Gates makes the group wear green spectacles for protection and then leads them into the Emerald City.",chapter:"Chapter X The Guardian of the Gates",first_line:163,last_line:166,text:`Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he

friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.
The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble
and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a
pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined
together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the
brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the
sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were
green.
There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and
these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They
looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering
eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when
they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the
street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy
and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green
hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling
green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that
they paid for it with green pennies.
There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried
things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.
Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.`,length:1405,num_lines:22,location:"Fields Of Buttercups",importance:.8,conflict:.1,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Exploring the Emerald City with friends",importance:.7,emotion:"Amazed and curious",sentiment:.8,quote:"Look at all the beautiful green things!",importance_rank:1},{name:"Lion",role:"Accompanying Dorothy, causing children to hide",importance:.5,emotion:"Curious but slightly concerned",sentiment:.3,quote:"Why are they hiding from me?",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:8},{title:"At the Palace Gates",summary:"The group is taken to the Palace of Oz and told they must see the Wizard individually.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:23,last_line:47,text:`The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came
to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the

dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.
"Here are strangers," said the Guardian of the Gates to him, "and they
demand to see the Great Oz."
"Step inside," answered the soldier, "and I will carry your message to
him."
So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room
with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The
soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering
this room, and when they were seated he said politely:
"Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the
Throne Room and tell Oz you are here."
They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at
last, he came back, Dorothy asked:
"Have you seen Oz?"
"Oh, no," returned the soldier; "I have never seen him. But I spoke to
him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he
will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must
enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.
Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will
have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your

said, "Follow me and I will show you your room."
So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the
dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up
three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the
Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft
comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet
counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that
shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a
beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in
the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.
When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer
green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.
In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and
velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.`,length:1114,num_lines:17,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.1,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Exploring her new room",importance:.9,emotion:"Curious and delighted",sentiment:.8,quote:"This is the sweetest little room in the world!",importance_rank:1},{name:"Green Girl",role:"Guiding Dorothy to her room",importance:.7,emotion:"Welcoming and friendly",sentiment:.9,quote:"Follow me and I will show you your room.",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:9},{title:"Restless Night at the Palace",summary:"The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion try to sleep in their unfamiliar surroundings.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:65,last_line:83,text:`"Make yourself perfectly at home," said the green girl, "and if you

She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led
to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant
part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the
Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood
stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It
would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he
remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web
in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most
wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from
force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not
being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down
to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have
preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being
shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so
he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred
himself asleep in a minute.`,length:1202,num_lines:19,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.7,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Receives hospitality from the green girl",importance:.6,emotion:"Curious and comfortable",sentiment:.5,quote:"Make yourself perfectly at home.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Stands still, unable to sleep",importance:.5,emotion:"Stupidly patient",sentiment:0,quote:"He stood stupidly in one spot.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Moves joints to ensure they work",importance:.5,emotion:"Restless and mechanical",sentiment:0,quote:"He passed the night moving his joints up and down.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Lion",role:"Adapts to the room and sleeps",importance:.5,emotion:"Content and relaxed",sentiment:.5,quote:"He sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat.",importance_rank:4}],number:4,importance_rank:9,conflict_rank:7},{title:"Dorothy's Audience with Oz",summary:"Dorothy meets Oz, who appears as a giant Head, and is tasked with killing the Wicked Witch of the West.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:84,last_line:177,text:`The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch
Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of
green brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a
green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room
of the Great Oz.
First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen
of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to
do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the
Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see
Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them
whispered:
"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?"
"Of course," answered the girl, "if he will see me."
"Oh, he will see you," said the soldier who had taken her message to
the Wizard, "although he does not like to have people ask to see him.
Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you
came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned
your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about
the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his
presence."
Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, "That is the
signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone."
She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found
herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high
arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with
large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a
great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a
wonderful manner.
But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble
that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and
sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair
was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs
whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose
and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.
As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly
and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and
Dorothy heard a voice say:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big
Head; so she took courage and answered:
"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help."
The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the
voice:
"Where did you get the silver shoes?"
"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on
her and killed her," she replied.
"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?" continued the voice.
"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me
good-bye and sent me to you," said the girl.
Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the
truth. Then Oz asked, "What do you wish me to do?"
"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are," she
answered earnestly. "I don't like your country, although it is so
beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my
being away so long."
The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and
down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see
every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.
"Why should I do this for you?" asked Oz.
"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard
and I am only a little girl."
"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East," said
Oz.
"That just happened," returned Dorothy simply; "I could not help it."
"Well," said the Head, "I will give you my answer. You have no right to
expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in
return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If
you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do
something for me first. Help me and I will help you."
"What must I do?" asked the girl.
"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West," answered Oz.
"But I cannot!" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.
"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which
bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all
this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to
Kansas—but not before."
The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the
eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz
felt that she could help him if she would.
"I never killed anything, willingly," she sobbed. "Even if I wanted to,
how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,
cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?"
"I do not know," said the Head; "but that is my answer, and until the
Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember
that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.
Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task."
Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion
and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had
said to her. "There is no hope for me," she said sadly, "for Oz will
not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and
that I can never do."
Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy
went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to
sleep.`,length:5573,num_lines:94,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:1,conflict:1,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Seeks help from Oz to return home",importance:1,emotion:"Desperate and sad",sentiment:-1,quote:"I never killed anything, willingly.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Oz",role:"Demands Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West",importance:1,emotion:"Imposing and authoritative",sentiment:-1,quote:"You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Green Maiden",role:"Dresses Dorothy and guides her to Oz",importance:.5,emotion:"Supportive",sentiment:1,quote:"That is the signal.

Scarecrow and said:
"Come with me, for Oz has sent for you."
So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne
Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.
She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green
locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,
gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest
breath of air reached them.
When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would
let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,
and said:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had
told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.
"I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,
and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead
of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your
dominions."
"Why should I do this for you?" asked the Lady.
"Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,"
answered the Scarecrow.
"I never grant favors without some return," said Oz; "but this much I
will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I
will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you
will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz."
"I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch," said the Scarecrow, in
surprise.
"So I did. I don't care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not
grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned
the brains you so greatly desire."
The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what
Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard
was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.
"All the same," said the Scarecrow, "she needs a heart as much as the
Tin Woodman."`,length:2005,num_lines:36,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Seeks brains from Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"hopeful yet disappointed",sentiment:.2,quote:"I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Oz",role:"Grants wishes with conditions",importance:.9,emotion:"calm yet authoritative",sentiment:.1,quote:"If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I will bestow upon you a great many brains.",importance_rank:2}],number:6,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:4},{title:"The Tin Woodman's Audience with Oz",summary:"The Tin Woodman meets Oz, who now appears as a terrible Beast, and is tasked with killing the Witch in exchange for a heart.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:214,last_line:258,text:`On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin
Woodman and said:
"Oz has sent for you. Follow me."
So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He
did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he
hoped it would be the lovely Lady. "For," he said to himself, "if it is
the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no
heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the
lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves
said to be kindly hearted."
But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the
Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.
It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly
strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a
rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long
arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.
Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more
dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the
Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud
and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all
afraid, although he was much disappointed.
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible," spoke the Beast, in a voice that was
one great roar. "Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
"I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot
love. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are."
"Why should I do this?" demanded the Beast.
"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request," answered the
Woodman.
Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: "If you indeed desire a
heart, you must earn it."
"How?" asked the Woodman.
"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West," replied the Beast.
"When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the
biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz."
So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and
tell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly
at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the
Lion said:
"If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so
frighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely
Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my
bidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I
will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us
what we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be
well."`,length:2662,num_lines:45,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Seeks a heart from Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"hopeful yet disappointed",sentiment:.2,quote:"I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Oz",role:"Appears as a terrible Beast",importance:.9,emotion:"gruff and intimidating",sentiment:-.5,quote:"If you indeed desire a heart, you must earn it.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Lion",role:"Plans to confront Oz",importance:.7,emotion:"confident and determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be well.",importance_rank:3}],number:7,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Lion's Audience with Oz",summary:"The Lion meets Oz, who now appears as a Ball of Fire, and is tasked with killing the Witch in exchange for courage.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:259,last_line:283,text:`The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to
the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.
The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to
his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and
glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was
that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he
tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his
whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.
Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the
words it spoke:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
And the Lion answered, "I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I
came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may
become the King of Beasts, as men call me."
"Why should I give you courage?" demanded Oz.
"Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to
grant my request," answered the Lion.
The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, "Bring
me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you
courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward."
The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and
while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so
furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad
to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible
interview with the Wizard.`,length:1551,num_lines:25,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Lion",role:"Seeks courage from Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"fearful and desperate",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Oz",role:"Challenges the Lion's request",importance:.9,emotion:"demanding and authoritative",sentiment:0,quote:"Bring me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead.",importance_rank:2}],number:8,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"The Decision to Face the Witch",summary:"The group decides to journey to the Winkies' land and kill the Wicked Witch of the West.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:284,last_line:314,text:`"What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy sadly.
"There is only one thing we can do," returned the Lion, "and that is to
go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy
her."
"But suppose we cannot?" said the girl.
"Then I shall never have courage," declared the Lion.
"And I shall never have brains," added the Scarecrow.
"And I shall never have a heart," spoke the Tin Woodman.
"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry," said Dorothy,
beginning to cry.
"Be careful!" cried the green girl. "The tears will fall on your green
silk gown and spot it."
So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, "I suppose we must try it; but I am
sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again."
"I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch,"
said the Lion.
"I will go too," declared the Scarecrow; "but I shall not be of much
help to you, I am such a fool."
"I haven't the heart to harm even a Witch," remarked the Tin Woodman;
"but if you go I certainly shall go with you."
Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,
and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his
joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw
and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The
green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy's basket with
good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto's neck with
a green ribbon.
They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when
they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the
back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a
green egg.`,length:1662,num_lines:31,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Wants to see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry",importance:1,emotion:"sad and determined",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Lion",role:"Wants courage to face the Witch",importance:1,emotion:"cowardly yet brave",sentiment:-.3,quote:"Then I shall never have courage.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Wants brains to help in the quest",importance:1,emotion:"self-doubting",sentiment:-.4,quote:"I shall not be of much help to you, I am such a fool.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Wants a heart to face the Witch",importance:1,emotion:"gentle and reluctant",sentiment:-.2,quote:"I haven't the heart to harm even a Witch.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Green Girl",role:"Cares for Dorothy and her friends",importance:.5,emotion:"concerned",sentiment:.5,quote:"Be careful!

Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the
Gates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in
his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.
"Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?" asked Dorothy.
"There is no road," answered the Guardian of the Gates. "No one ever
wishes to go that way."
"How, then, are we to find her?" inquired the girl.
"That will be easy," replied the man, "for when she knows you are in
the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her
slaves."
"Perhaps not," said the Scarecrow, "for we mean to destroy her."
"Oh, that is different," said the Guardian of the Gates. "No one has
ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves
of you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and
fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where
the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her."
They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,
walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies
and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on
in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer
green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost its
green color and was as white as Dorothy's dress.
The Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground
became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this
country of the West, and the ground was untilled.
In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no

powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in
the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy
lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance
off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she
blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.
At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great
wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.
"Go to those people," said the Witch, "and tear them to pieces."
"Are you not going to make them your slaves?" asked the leader of the
wolves.
"No," she answered, "one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and
another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into
small pieces."
"Very well," said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed
by the others.
It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard
the wolves coming.
"This is my fight," said the Woodman, "so get behind me and I will meet
them as they come."
He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of
the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's
head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could
raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp
edge of the Tin Woodman's weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty
times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap
before the Woodman.
Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, "It
was a good fight, friend."
They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was
quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the
Tin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down
to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.`,length:1908,num_lines:33,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.9,conflict:.9,characters:[{name:"Wicked Witch Of The West",role:"Commands wolves to attack Dorothy and friends",importance:1,emotion:"Angry and vengeful",sentiment:-.8,quote:"Go to those people, and tear them to pieces.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Defends Dorothy and friends from wolves",importance:1,emotion:"Brave and determined",sentiment:.9,quote:"This is my fight, so get behind me.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Supports Tin Woodman during the fight",importance:.7,emotion:"Supportive and relieved",sentiment:.8,quote:"It was a good fight, friend.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Dorothy",role:"Awakens to find her friends safe",importance:.8,emotion:"Frightened but grateful",sentiment:.7,quote:"Thank you for saving us!",importance_rank:3}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Attack of the Crows",summary:"The Wicked Witch sends crows to attack, but the Scarecrow defeats them.",chapter:"Chapter XII The Search for the Wicked Witch",first_line:64,last_line:87,text:`Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle

whistle twice.
Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough
to darken the sky.
And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, "Fly at once to the
strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces."
The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her
companions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.
But the Scarecrow said, "This is my battle, so lie down beside me and
you will not be harmed."
So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up
and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were
frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare
to come any nearer. But the King Crow said:
"It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out."
The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and
twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and
the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty
times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead

"Go to the strangers and sting them to death!" commanded the Witch, and
the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and
her friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the
Scarecrow had decided what to do.
"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and
the Lion," he said to the Woodman, "and the bees cannot sting them."
This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held
Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.
The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew
at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting
the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are
broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick
about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.
Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman

Lion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies
were so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.
When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a

rubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it
could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any
order they were given. But no person could command these strange
creatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had
used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her
slaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys
had helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against
the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The
Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could
she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so
until all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce
wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her
slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was
only one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.
So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it
upon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:
"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!"
Next she stood upon her right foot and said:
"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!"
After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:
"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!"
Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling
sound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great
chattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show
the Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of
immense and powerful wings on his shoulders.
One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew
close to the Witch and said, "You have called us for the third and last
time. What do you command?"
"Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except
the Lion," said the Wicked Witch. "Bring that beast to me, for I have a
mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work."
"Your commands shall be obeyed," said the leader. Then, with a great
deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place
where Dorothy and her friends were walking.`,length:2219,num_lines:36,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Wicked Witch Of The West",role:"Uses the Golden Cap to summon Winged Monkeys to destroy Dorothy and her friends",importance:1,emotion:"determined and malicious",sentiment:-.8,quote:"Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except the Lion.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Leader Of The Monkeys",role:"Obey the Wicked Witch's command to attack Dorothy and her friends",importance:.8,emotion:"obedient and chaotic",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Your commands shall be obeyed.",importance_rank:2}],number:6,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:7},{title:"The Monkeys Capture Dorothy's Friends",summary:"The Winged Monkeys capture the Tin Woodman, Scarecrow, and Lion, but leave Dorothy unharmed.",chapter:"Chapter XII The Search for the Wicked Witch",first_line:160,last_line:194,text:`Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the
air until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.
Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the
rocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move
nor groan.
Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers
pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat
and boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top
branches of a tall tree.
The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and
wound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable
to bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and
flew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a
small yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not
escape.
But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,
watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her
turn. The Leader Of The Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy
arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the
mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,
motioning the others not to touch her.
"We dare not harm this little girl," he said to them, "for she is
protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of
Evil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch
and leave her there."
So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried
her swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they
set her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the
Witch:
"We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the
Scarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The
little girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your
power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again."

noise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.`,length:2107,num_lines:35,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Captured and dropped by Monkeys",importance:.7,emotion:"hurt and helpless",sentiment:-.8,quote:"I cannot move or groan.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Stripped of straw by Monkeys",importance:.6,emotion:"vulnerable and discarded",sentiment:-.7,quote:"They made my clothes into a bundle.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Lion",role:"Bound and captured by Monkeys",importance:.8,emotion:"trapped and powerless",sentiment:-.9,quote:"I cannot bite or scratch.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Dorothy",role:"Witnessing her friends' capture",importance:1,emotion:"worried and anxious",sentiment:-.5,quote:"It will soon be my turn.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Leader Of The Monkeys",role:"Commands the Monkeys and spares Dorothy",importance:.5,emotion:"grinning and mischievous",sentiment:.1,quote:"We dare not harm this little girl.",importance_rank:5}],number:7,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:8},{title:"Dorothy at the Witch's Mercy",summary:"Dorothy becomes the Wicked Witch's prisoner, but the Witch fears her power.",chapter:"Chapter XII The Search for the Wicked Witch",first_line:195,last_line:244,text:`The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark
on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged
Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked
down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble
with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At
first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened
to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them
was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the
Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and
thought, "I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to
use her power." Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:
"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you
do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the
Scarecrow."
Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle
until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots
and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as
she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill
her.
With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the
courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse
her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to
go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and
bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and
shut the gate again.
"If I cannot harness you," said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through
the bars of the gate, "I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat
until you do as I wish."
So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day
she came to the gate at noon and asked, "Are you ready to be harnessed
like a horse?"
And the Lion would answer, "No. If you come in this yard, I will bite
you."
The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that
every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from
the cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,
and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy
mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to
escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was
constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the
Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.
The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch
threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in
her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of
the mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full
of fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with
her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in
return. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so
wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.`,length:3124,num_lines:50,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Wicked Witch Of The West",role:"Attempts to control Dorothy and the Lion",importance:.9,emotion:"malicious and cunning",sentiment:-.8,quote:"I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to use her power.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Dorothy",role:"Works hard under the Witch's command and cares for the Lion",importance:.9,emotion:"fearful yet determined",sentiment:.2,quote:"I will work as hard as I can.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Lion",role:"Refuses to be harnessed and relies on Dorothy for food",importance:.7,emotion:"defiant and proud",sentiment:.1,quote:"No. If you come in this yard, I will bite you.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Toto",role:"Protects Dorothy and retaliates against the Witch",importance:.5,emotion:"brave and loyal",sentiment:.5,quote:"*barks and bites the Witch's leg*",importance_rank:4}],number:8,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:9},{title:"Dorothy's Sadness and the Witch's Desire",summary:"Dorothy despairs while the Wicked Witch covets her Silver Shoes.",chapter:"Chapter XII The Search for the Wicked Witch",first_line:245,last_line:264,text:`Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would

his little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas
or the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the
little girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.
Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver
Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves
were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of
the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,
they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.
She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,
thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty
shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took
her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in
Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was
greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy

"You are a wicked creature!" cried Dorothy. "You have no right to take
my shoe from me."
"I shall keep it, just the same," said the Witch, laughing at her, "and
someday I shall get the other one from you, too."
This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water
that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to
foot.
Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as
Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall
away.
"See what you have done!" she screamed. "In a minute I shall melt
away."
"I'm very sorry, indeed," said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see
the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.
"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?" asked the Witch, in a
wailing, despairing voice.
"Of course not," answered Dorothy. "How should I?"
"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the
castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a
little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked
deeds. Look out—here I go!"
With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass
and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing
that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket
of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the
door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of
the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her
foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to

rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted
to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from
bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they
knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and
part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin
Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade

"Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths," they told her.
"Then bring them to me," she said. And when the tinsmiths came,
bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, "Can you
straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into
shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?"
The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that
they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So
they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and
worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and
bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body
and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into
his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there
were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as
the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.
When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for
rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy
had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his
joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick
and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears
did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so
often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was
obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it
dried.`,length:1537,num_lines:24,location:"Yellow Castle",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Requests help for the Tin Woodman",importance:.8,emotion:"Hopeful and caring",sentiment:.9,quote:"Then bring them to me.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Is repaired by the tinsmiths",importance:.9,emotion:"Grateful and emotional",sentiment:.9,quote:"Thank you for rescuing me.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Lion",role:"Shows emotional support",importance:.5,emotion:"Sympathetic and emotional",sentiment:.8,quote:"I wiped my eyes so often.",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:4},{title:"The Scarecrow is found",summary:"The group sets out to find the Scarecrow, chopping down the tree where his clothes were abandoned and restuffing him with straw.",chapter:"Chapter XIII The Rescue",first_line:51,last_line:72,text:`"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again," said the Tin Woodman,

So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and
part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of
which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.
It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could
climb it; but the Woodman said at once, "I'll chop it down, and then we
can get the Scarecrow's clothes."
Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,
another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of
solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old
broken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed
and it glistened like burnished silver.
As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short
time the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow's clothes
fell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.
Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the
castle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!

But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, "We must go back to
Oz, and claim his promise."
"Yes," said the Woodman, "at last I shall get my heart."
"And I shall get my brains," added the Scarecrow joyfully.
"And I shall get my courage," said the Lion thoughtfully.
"And I shall get back to Kansas," cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.
"Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!"
This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together
and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and
they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay
and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were
determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden
collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with
diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,
to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a
silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.
Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,
and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.
Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her basket with food for
the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own
head and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything
about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so
she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.

tell us the way to the Emerald City."

Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck

"I didn't know there was a charm," answered Dorothy, in surprise. "What

"Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl anxiously.
"Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she
scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.
Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon

they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;
but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air
quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and
woods far below them.
Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,
one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and
were careful not to hurt her.
"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?" she asked.
"That is a long story," answered the King, with a winged laugh; "but as
we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you
about it, if you wish."
"I shall be glad to hear it," she replied.
"Once," began the leader, "we were a free people, living happily in the
great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and
doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some
of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull
the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing
nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and
happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was
many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this
land.
"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who
was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the
people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name
was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great
blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that
she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much
too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,
however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his
years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she
would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used
all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any
woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,
was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly
beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to
make everything ready for the wedding.
"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which
lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a
joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my
grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking
beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and
purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could
do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in
their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then
dropped him into the water.
"'Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, 'and see if the
water has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim,
and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He
laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.
But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and
velvet all ruined by the river.
"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had
all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that
their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had
treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded
hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings
tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette
finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever
after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This
Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to
have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and
all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how
it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the
Golden Cap, whosoever he may be."
"And what became of them?" asked Dorothy, who had been greatly
interested in the story.
"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap," replied the Monkey,
"he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not
bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he
had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never
again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we
were all afraid of her.
"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the
hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,
and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the
Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your
wishes upon us."
As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the
green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at
the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The
strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of
the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,

They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,
Dorothy asked, "Where are you?"

heart?"
"Or I my courage?" asked the Lion.
"Or I my brains?" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes
with his coat sleeve.
"My dear friends," said Oz, "I pray you not to speak of these little
things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found
out."
"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?" asked Dorothy.
"No one knows it but you four—and myself," replied Oz. "I have fooled
everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a
great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will
not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible."
"But, I don't understand," said Dorothy, in bewilderment. "How was it
that you appeared to me as a great Head?"
"That was one of my tricks," answered Oz. "Step this way, please, and I
will tell you all about it."
He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and
they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great
Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully
painted face.
"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire," said Oz. "I stood behind the
screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open."
"But how about the voice?" she inquired.
"Oh, I am a ventriloquist," said the little man. "I can throw the sound
of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of
the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you." He showed
the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be
the lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was
nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their
sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also
from the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was
poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.
"Really," said the Scarecrow, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
being such a humbug."
"I am—I certainly am," answered the little man sorrowfully; "but it was
the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of
chairs; and I will tell you my story."
So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.
"I was born in Omaha—"
"Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried Dorothy.
"No, but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his head at her
sadly. "When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very
well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or
beast." Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears
and looked everywhere to see where she was. "After a time," continued
Oz, "I tired of that, and became a balloonist."
"What is that?" asked Dorothy.
"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of
people together and get them to pay to see the circus," he explained.
"Oh," she said, "I know."
"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so
that I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so
far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles
away. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the
morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a
strange and beautiful country.
"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself
in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,
thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because
they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.
"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to
build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.
Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call
it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green
spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green."
"But isn't everything here green?" asked Dorothy.
"No more than in any other city," replied Oz; "but when you wear green
spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The
Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man
when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my
people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them
think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful
place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing
that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and
they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself
up and would not see any of them.
"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical
powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do
wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they
ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.
Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew
they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were
terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they
themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in
deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I
was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.
When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would
only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I
am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises."
"I think you are a very bad man," said Dorothy.
"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad
Wizard, I must admit."
"Can't you give me brains?" asked the Scarecrow.
"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has
brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that
brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience
you are sure to get."
"That may all be true," said the Scarecrow, "but I shall be very
unhappy unless you give me brains."
The false Wizard looked at him carefully.
"Well," he said with a sigh, "I'm not much of a magician, as I said;
but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head
with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find
that out for yourself."

afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty."
"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same," said the Lion. "I shall
really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that
makes one forget he is afraid."
"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow," replied Oz.
"How about my heart?" asked the Tin Woodman.
"Why, as for that," answered Oz, "I think you are wrong to want a
heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in
luck not to have a heart."
"That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin Woodman. "For my part,
I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me
the heart."
"Very well," answered Oz meekly. "Come to me tomorrow and you shall

"Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I

"I have always liked you as you were," said Dorothy simply.
"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied. "But surely you
will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain
is going to turn out." Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful
voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.
"Come in," said Oz.
The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the
window, engaged in deep thought.
"I have come for my brains," remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.
"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz. "You must excuse
me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put
your brains in their proper place."
"That's all right," said the Scarecrow. "You are quite welcome to take
my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on
again."
So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he
entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed
with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together
thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture
and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.
When he had fastened the Scarecrow's head on his body again he said to
him, "Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of
bran-new brains."
The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his
greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his
friends.
Dorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the
top with brains.
"How do you feel?" she asked.
"I feel wise indeed," he answered earnestly. "When I get used to my
brains I shall know everything."
"Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?" asked the
Tin Woodman.
"That is proof that he is sharp," remarked the Lion.`,length:1999,num_lines:37,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Scarecrow",role:"Seeks brains from Oz",importance:.9,emotion:"Excited and hopeful",sentiment:.8,quote:"I feel wise indeed.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Dorothy",role:"Supports Scarecrow's wish",importance:.7,emotion:"Curious and supportive",sentiment:.7,quote:"I have always liked you as you were.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Oz",role:"Gives Scarecrow brains",importance:.8,emotion:"Calm and thoughtful",sentiment:.6,quote:"You must excuse me for taking your head off.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Tin Woodman",role:"Inquires about Scarecrow's new head",importance:.5,emotion:"Inquisitive",sentiment:.5,quote:"Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?",importance_rank:4},{name:"Lion",role:"Makes a joke about Scarecrow",importance:.4,emotion:"Playful",sentiment:.6,quote:"That is proof that he is sharp.",importance_rank:5}],number:1,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:2},{title:"The Tin Woodman Gets His Heart",summary:"The Tin Woodman visits Oz to receive his heart, which is made of silk and sawdust.",chapter:"Chapter XVI The Magic Art of the Great Humbug",first_line:38,last_line:63,text:`"Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart," said the Woodman.

"Oh, no," answered the Woodman. "I shall not feel it at all."
So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole

drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed
with sawdust.
"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked.
"It is, indeed!" replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. "But is
it a kind heart?"
"Oh, very!" answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and
then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it
had been cut.
"There," said he; "now you have a heart that any man might be proud of.
I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't
be helped."
"Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman. "I am very

sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:
"Drink."
"What is it?" asked the Lion.
"Well," answered Oz, "if it were inside of you, it would be courage.
You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this

I advise you to drink it as soon as possible."

"Yes, of course," replied Oz. "I am tired of being such a humbug. If I
should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a
Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.
So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.
I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again."
"I shall be glad to have your company," said Dorothy.
"Thank you," he answered. "Now, if you will help me sew the silk
together, we will begin to work on our balloon."
So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips
of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First
there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and
then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon
in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew
all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of
green silk more than twenty feet long.
Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it
airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.`,length:1719,num_lines:27,location:"Palace Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Oz",role:"Plans to make a balloon",importance:.8,emotion:"determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am tired of being such a humbug.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Dorothy",role:"Helps Oz with the balloon",importance:.7,emotion:"enthusiastic",sentiment:.7,quote:"I shall be glad to have your company.",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Preparing for Departure",summary:"Oz prepares for departure, announcing his temporary leave to his people and readying the balloon.",chapter:"Chapter XVII How the Balloon Was Launched",first_line:56,last_line:69,text:`"But we must have a basket to ride in," he said.

with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened
with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.
When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to
make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The
news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the
wonderful sight.
Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the
people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a
big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom
of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it
would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out
and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the

The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to
the ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much
lighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into
the sky.
"Come, Dorothy!" cried the Wizard. "Hurry up, or the balloon will fly
away."
"I can't find Toto anywhere," replied Dorothy, who did not wish to
leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a
kitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran
towards the balloon.
She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to
help her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon
rose into the air without her.`,length:894,num_lines:16,location:"Wizard's Balloon Departure",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Oz",role:"Announces Scarecrow's rule",importance:1,emotion:"determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"I command you to obey him as you would me.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Dorothy",role:"Searches for Toto",importance:1,emotion:"anxious",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I can't find Toto anywhere.",importance_rank:2}],number:5,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Dorothy's Disappointment and Oz's Legacy",summary:"Dorothy is left behind as Oz floats away, leaving her with the others in Oz.",chapter:"Chapter XVII How the Balloon Was Launched",first_line:86,last_line:98,text:`"Come back!" she screamed.

the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and
farther into the sky.
And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,
though he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we
know. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:
"Oz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this
beautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise
Scarecrow to rule over us."

"With pleasure," she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the
Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears
carefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he
thanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled
oil-can, to guard against mishap.
The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he

the big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.

Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I
remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's
cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am
quite satisfied with my lot."
"I also," said the Tin Woodman, "am well-pleased with my new heart;
and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world."
"For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that
ever lived, if not braver," said the Lion modestly.
"If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,"
continued the Scarecrow, "we might all be happy together."
"But I don't want to live here," cried Dorothy. "I want to go to
Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry."
"Well, then, what can be done?" inquired the Woodman.
The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins
and needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:
"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the
desert?"
"I never thought of that!" said Dorothy joyfully.

When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and
soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and
stood beside her.
"This is the second time you have called us," said the Monkey King,
bowing before the little girl. "What do you wish?"
"I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy.
But the Monkey King shook his head.
"That cannot be done," he said. "We belong to this country alone, and
cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,
and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We
shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross
the desert. Good-bye."
And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away
through the window, followed by all his band.
Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. "I have wasted the charm

The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly
that Dorothy feared it would burst.
"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers," he said, "and ask
his advice."
So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for
while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.
"This little girl," said the Scarecrow to the soldier, "wishes to cross
the desert. How can she do so?"
"I cannot tell," answered the soldier, "for nobody has ever crossed the
desert, unless it is Oz himself."
"Is there no one who can help me?" asked Dorothy earnestly.
"Glinda might," he suggested.
"Who is Glinda?" inquired the Scarecrow.
"The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,
and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of
the desert, so she may know a way to cross it."
"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?" asked the child.
"The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier, "and she is kind
to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows
how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."
"How can I get to her castle?" asked Dorothy.
"The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but it is said to be
full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a
race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For
this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City."
The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:
"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is
to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of

them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City

which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to
carry with them.
"You are now our ruler," he said to the Scarecrow; "so you must come
back to us as soon as possible."
"I certainly shall if I am able," the Scarecrow replied; "but I must
help Dorothy to get home, first."
As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:
"I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has
been good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am."
"Don't try, my dear," he answered. "We should like to keep you with us,
but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a
way." He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth
and started upon their journey.
The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the
Land of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed
and chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of
getting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of

They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they
could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and
high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.
"Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all," said the Tin Woodman, as he
felt his heart rattling around in his breast.

Scarecrow.
"If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me," added the

that stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that
night on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they
rested very well indeed.
In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There
was no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and
left as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change
the direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked
for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.
The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with
such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass
underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under
the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next
minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his
fellow travelers.
This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked
rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.
"Here is another space between the trees," called the Lion.
"Let me try it first," said the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt me to
get thrown about." He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its
branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.
"This is strange," exclaimed Dorothy. "What shall we do?"
"The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our
journey," remarked the Lion.
"I believe I will try it myself," said the Woodman, and shouldering his
axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so
roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped
at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking
all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under
it.
"Come on!" he shouted to the others. "Be quick!" They all ran forward
and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught
by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly
chopped off the branch and set the little dog free.
The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they
made up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down
their branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the
forest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out
of it.
The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came
to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found
before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was
smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.
"What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy.
"I will make a ladder," said the Tin Woodman, "for we certainly must
climb over the wall."`,length:2785,num_lines:46,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Dorothy",role:"Concerned about the trees' behavior",importance:.8,emotion:"Surprised and worried",sentiment:-.2,quote:"This is strange.

"I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of."
"Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall," replied the
Woodman. "When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the
other side."
After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin
Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The
Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the
ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was
so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from
falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the
Scarecrow said, "Oh, my!"
"Go on," exclaimed Dorothy.
So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the
wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, "Oh, my!" just as the
Scarecrow had done.
Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him
be still.
The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but

shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were
many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.
These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as
high as Dorothy's waist. There were also pretty little barns, with
china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs
and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.
But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer
country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored
bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most
gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in
knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and
golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon
their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns
in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,
pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of
china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of
them was no higher than Dorothy's knee.
No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little
purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and
barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.
"How shall we get down?" asked Dorothy.
They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the
Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that
the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not

They began walking through the country of the china people, and the
first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As
they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,
the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china
ground with a great clatter.
Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and
that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor
milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.
"There!" cried the milkmaid angrily. "See what you have done! My cow
has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have
it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my
cow?"
"I'm very sorry," returned Dorothy. "Please forgive us."
But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She
picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping
on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful
glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked
elbow close to her side.
Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.

Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But
the china girl cried out:
"Don't chase me! Don't chase me!"
She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,
"Why not?"
"Because," answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,
"if I run I may fall down and break myself."
"But could you not be mended?" asked the girl.
"Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,"
replied the Princess.
"I suppose not," said Dorothy.
"Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns," continued the china lady,
"who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so
often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all
pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself."
Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy
could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and
green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way
and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.
The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his
cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:
"My lady fair,
Why do you stare
At poor old Mr. Joker?
You're quite as stiff
And prim as if
You'd eaten up a poker!"
"Be quiet, sir!" said the Princess. "Can't you see these are strangers,
and should be treated with respect?"
"Well, that's respect, I expect," declared the Clown, and immediately
stood upon his head.
"Don't mind Mr. Joker," said the Princess to Dorothy. "He is
considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish."
"Oh, I don't mind him a bit," said Dorothy. "But you are so beautiful,"
she continued, "that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won't you let
me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could
carry you in my basket."
"That would make me very unhappy," answered the china Princess. "You
see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move
around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints
at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of
course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and
cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter
here in our own country."
"I would not make you unhappy for all the world!" exclaimed Dorothy.
