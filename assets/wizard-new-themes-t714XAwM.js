the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry
and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in

small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family

put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat
up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the
bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She
sprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.
The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes
growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.
The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the
midst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of
greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious
fruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with
rare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.
A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between
green banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl
who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.`,length:1158,num_lines:17,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.1,characters:[{name:"Wonder And Amazement",role:"Dorothy's reaction to her new environment",importance:.9,emotion:"Astonishment and Joy",sentiment:1,quote:"The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Beauty Of Nature",role:"Description of the new land's beauty",importance:.8,emotion:"Delight and Serenity",sentiment:1,quote:"There were lovely patches of greensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Change",role:"Shift from the familiar to the unknown",importance:.7,emotion:"Curiosity and Excitement",sentiment:.8,quote:"The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the midst of a country of marvelous beauty.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:6},{title:"Meeting the Munchkins",summary:"Dorothy encounters the Munchkins and learns of her impact.",chapter:"Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins",first_line:18,last_line:66,text:`While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,
she noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had
ever seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been
used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about
as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although
they were, so far as looks go, many years older.
Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore
round hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with
little bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The
hats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she
wore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were
sprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men
were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore
well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,
Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had
beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was
covered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather
stiffly.
When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the
doorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to
come farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low
bow and said, in a sweet voice:
"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.
We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the
East, and for setting our people free from bondage."
Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little
woman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had
killed the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless
little girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;
and she had never killed anything in all her life.
But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,
with hesitation, "You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I
have not killed anything."
"Your house did, anyway," replied the little old woman, with a laugh,
"and that is the same thing. See!" she continued, pointing to the
corner of the house. "There are her two feet, still sticking out from
under a block of wood."
Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just
under the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were
sticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.
"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in
dismay. "The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?"
"There is nothing to be done," said the little woman calmly.
"But who was she?" asked Dorothy.
"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said," answered the little
woman. "She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,
making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and
are grateful to you for the favor."
"Who are the Munchkins?" inquired Dorothy.`,length:3039,num_lines:49,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Unexpected Arrival",role:"Dorothy's arrival surprises the Munchkins",importance:.8,emotion:"Curiosity and confusion",sentiment:.5,quote:"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Misunderstanding",role:"Dorothy misunderstands her role in the situation",importance:.9,emotion:"Dismay and confusion",sentiment:-.5,quote:"I have not killed anything.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Freedom",role:"The Munchkins celebrate their newfound freedom",importance:.7,emotion:"Joy and relief",sentiment:1,quote:"Now they are all set free, and are grateful to you for the favor.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Curiosity",role:"Dorothy's curiosity about her surroundings and the Munchkins",importance:.6,emotion:"Wonder",sentiment:.5,quote:"Who are the Munchkins?",importance_rank:4}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:1},{title:"The Witch of the North",summary:"Dorothy meets the Witch of the North and learns about witches.",chapter:"Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins",first_line:67,last_line:84,text:`"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked

messenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North."

the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who
ruled here, or I should have set the people free myself."
"But I thought all witches were wicked," said the girl, who was half
frightened at facing a real witch. "Oh, no, that is a great mistake.
There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,
those who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know
this is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.

that the witches were all dead—years and years ago."
"Who is Aunt Em?" inquired the little old woman.
"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from."
The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed
and her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, "I do not
know where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned
before. But tell me, is it a civilized country?"
"Oh, yes," replied Dorothy.
"Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there
are no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,
you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off
from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and
wizards amongst us."
"Who are the wizards?" asked Dorothy.
"Oz himself is the Great Wizard," answered the Witch, sinking her voice
to a whisper. "He is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He
lives in the City of Emeralds."
Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,
who had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the
corner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.
"What is it?" asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to
laugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing
was left but the silver shoes.
"She was so old," explained the Witch of the North, "that she dried up
quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are
yours, and you shall have them to wear." She reached down and picked up
the shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to
Dorothy.

the Munchkins, "and there is some charm connected with them; but what
it is we never knew."`,length:1845,num_lines:32,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Witchcraft",role:"Discussion of witches and wizards",importance:.9,emotion:"Curiosity and intrigue",sentiment:.5,quote:"But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Power Dynamics",role:"Introduction of the Great Wizard",importance:.7,emotion:"Awe and respect",sentiment:.6,quote:"Oz himself is the Great Wizard, he is more powerful than all the rest of us together.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Transformation",role:"The Wicked Witch's demise",importance:.8,emotion:"Relief and finality",sentiment:.7,quote:"She was so old, that she dried up quickly in the sun.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Heritage",role:"Connection to Dorothy's past",importance:.6,emotion:"Nostalgia",sentiment:.4,quote:"Aunt Em has told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Mystery",role:"Unexplained charm of the silver shoes",importance:.5,emotion:"Wonder",sentiment:.5,quote:"There is some charm connected with them; but what it is we never knew.",importance_rank:5}],number:4,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Finding a way home",summary:"Dorothy seeks help to return home and learns about Oz.",chapter:"Chapter II The Council with the Munchkins",first_line:117,last_line:132,text:`Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.

"I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will

The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at
Dorothy, and then shook their heads.
"At the East, not far from here," said one, "there is a great desert,
and none could live to cross it."
"It is the same at the South," said another, "for I have been there and
seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings."

that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of

strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,
for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep
also. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced
the point on the end of her nose, while she counted "One, two, three"
in a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was
written in big, white chalk marks:
"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS"
The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the
words on it, asked, "Is your name Dorothy, my dear?"
"Yes," answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.
"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you."
"Where is this city?" asked Dorothy.
"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the
Great Wizard I told you of."
"Is he a good man?" inquired the girl anxiously.
"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I
have never seen him."
"How can I get there?" asked Dorothy.
"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is
sometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use
all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm."
"Won't you go with me?" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon
the little old woman as her only friend.
"No, I cannot do that," she replied, "but I will give you my kiss, and
no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of
the North."
She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where
her lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy
found out soon after.
"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick," said the
Witch, "so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of
him, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear."
The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,
after which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy
a friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and
straightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who
barked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been
afraid even to growl while she stood by.`,length:2273,num_lines:39,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Isolation",role:"Dorothy feels isolated among strangers",importance:.8,emotion:"sadness and longing",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The bond between Dorothy and the Witch",importance:.7,emotion:"comfort and support",sentiment:.5,quote:"I will give you my kiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of the North.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Journey",role:"Dorothy's quest to find help",importance:.9,emotion:"determination and hope",sentiment:.6,quote:"You must walk.

So she went to
the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.
She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it
down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.
Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting
there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging
from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what
she wanted to help out her breakfast.
Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to
a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for
the journey to the City of Emeralds.
Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was
hanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white
and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,
it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed
herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.
She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,
laying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and
noticed how old and worn her shoes were.
"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto," she said. And
Toto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his
tail to show he knew what she meant.
At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had
belonged to the Witch of the East.
"I wonder if they will fit me," she said to Toto. "They would be just
the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out."
She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which
fitted her as well as if they had been made for her.
Finally she picked up her basket.
"Come along, Toto," she said. "We will go to the Emerald City and ask
the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again."
She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket
of her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she
started on her journey.`,length:2095,num_lines:34,location:"Dorothy's Home",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Journey",role:"Dorothy prepares for her journey to the Emerald City",importance:.9,emotion:"determined and hopeful",sentiment:1,quote:"Come along, Toto, we will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Nostalgia",role:"Dorothy reflects on her old shoes and life in Kansas",importance:.7,emotion:"wistful",sentiment:0,quote:"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Discovery",role:"Dorothy discovers the silver shoes and their significance",importance:.8,emotion:"curiosity and excitement",sentiment:1,quote:"I wonder if they will fit me.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Dorothy Meets the Scarecrow",summary:"Dorothy encounters a Scarecrow who wishes to join her on her journey to the Emerald City.",chapter:"Chapter III How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow",first_line:99,last_line:171,text:`She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of
yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would
stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road
and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far
away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from
the ripe corn.
Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the
Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,
nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue
hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and
the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,
which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots
with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure
was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its
back.
While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the
Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.
She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the
scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its
head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and
walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.
"Good day," said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.
"Did you speak?" asked the girl, in wonder.
"Certainly," answered the Scarecrow. "How do you do?"
"I'm pretty well, thank you," replied Dorothy politely. "How do you
do?"
"I'm not feeling well," said the Scarecrow, with a smile, "for it is
very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows."
"Can't you get down?" asked Dorothy.
"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away
the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you."
Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,
being stuffed with straw, it was quite light.
"Thank you very much," said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on
the ground. "I feel like a new man."
Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man
speak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.
"Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and
yawned. "And where are you going?"
"My name is Dorothy," said the girl, "and I am going to the Emerald
City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas."
"Where is the Emerald City?" he inquired. "And who is Oz?"
"Why, don't you know?" she returned, in surprise.
"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no
brains at all," he answered sadly.
"Oh," said Dorothy, "I'm awfully sorry for you."
"Do you think," he asked, "if I go to the Emerald City with you, that
Oz would give me some brains?"
"I cannot tell," she returned, "but you may come with me, if you like.
If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you
are now."
"That is true," said the Scarecrow. "You see," he continued
confidentially, "I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,
because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin
into me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want
people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw
instead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?"
"I understand how you feel," said the little girl, who was truly sorry
for him. "If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for
you."
"Thank you," he answered gratefully.
They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and
they started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.
Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled
around the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats
in the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the
Scarecrow.
"Don't mind Toto," said Dorothy to her new friend. "He never bites."
"Oh, I'm not afraid," replied the Scarecrow. "He can't hurt the straw.
Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't
get tired. I'll tell you a secret," he continued, as he walked along.
"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of."

The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:
"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was
only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that
time is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one
of the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what
was going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing
I heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'
"'They aren't straight,'" answered the other.
"'Never mind,'" said the farmer. "'They are ears just the same,'" which
was true enough.
"'Now I'll make the eyes,'" said the farmer. So he painted my right
eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and
at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my
first glimpse of the world.
"'That's a rather pretty eye,'" remarked the Munchkin who was watching
the farmer. "'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'
"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'" said the farmer. And
when the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then
he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time
I didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make
my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at
last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as
anyone.
"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He
looks just like a man.'
"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The
farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a
tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked
away and left me alone.
"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.
But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on
that pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,
having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds
flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away
again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel
that I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near
me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and
said:
"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any
crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he
hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,
seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short
time there was a great flock of them about me.
"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow
after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had
brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a
better man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having
in this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'
"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try
hard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off
the stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me
brains as soon as we get to the Emerald City."`,length:3279,num_lines:53,location:"Cornfield",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Identity",role:"The Scarecrow discovers his existence and purpose.",importance:.9,emotion:"curiosity and loneliness",sentiment:.2,quote:"I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Self-discovery",role:"The Scarecrow reflects on his lack of brains and desires to improve.",importance:.8,emotion:"sadness and hope",sentiment:.3,quote:"If you only had brains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Isolation",role:"The Scarecrow feels isolated after being left alone in the field.",importance:.7,emotion:"sadness",sentiment:-.4,quote:"I did not like to be deserted this way.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Aspiration",role:"The Scarecrow aspires to gain brains and become more than he is.",importance:.8,emotion:"determination",sentiment:.5,quote:"I decided I would try hard to get some brains.",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Into the Forest",summary:"Dorothy and the Scarecrow venture into a dark forest.",chapter:"Chapter IV The Road Through the Forest",first_line:97,last_line:102,text:`There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough

Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.
"I see a little cottage at the right of us," he said, "built of logs
and branches. Shall we go there?"
"Yes, indeed," answered the child. "I am all tired out."
So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the
cottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one
corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a

"Why do you want water?" he asked.
"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the
dry bread will not stick in my throat."
"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh," said the Scarecrow
thoughtfully, "for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have
brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly."
They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a
little spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate
her breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and

yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.
"What was that?" she asked timidly.
"I cannot imagine," replied the Scarecrow; "but we can go and see."
Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to
come from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few
steps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine
that fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped
short, with a little cry of surprise.
One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing
beside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely
of tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he
stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.
Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while
Toto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his
teeth.
"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.
"Yes," answered the tin man, "I did. I've been groaning for more than a
year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."
"What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the
sad voice in which the man spoke.
"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered. "They are rusted so
badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon
be all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."
Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then
she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"
"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as
it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and
moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the
man could turn it himself.
"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said. And Dorothy oiled them and
the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust
and as good as new.
The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which
he leaned against the tree.
"This is a great comfort," he said. "I have been holding that axe in
the air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at
last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right
once more."
So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked
them again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite
creature, and very grateful.
"I might have stood there always if you had not come along," he said;
"so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?"
"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz," she
answered, "and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night."
"Why do you wish to see Oz?" he asked.
"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to
put a few brains into his head," she replied.
The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:
"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?"
"Why, I guess so," Dorothy answered. "It would be as easy as to give
the Scarecrow brains."
"True," the Tin Woodman returned. "So, if you will allow me to join
your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me."
"Come along," said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she
would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his
axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road
that was paved with yellow brick.`,length:3473,num_lines:59,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Help And Kindness",role:"Dorothy and Scarecrow assist the Tin Woodman",importance:.9,emotion:"compassionate and caring",sentiment:1,quote:"What can I do for you? she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Identity",role:"Tin Woodman seeks a heart",importance:.7,emotion:"hopeful and longing",sentiment:.5,quote:"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?",importance_rank:3},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"New alliance formed among characters",importance:.8,emotion:"joyful and united",sentiment:1,quote:"Come along, said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she would be pleased to have his company.",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Tin Woodman's Story",summary:"The Tin Woodman shares his tragic tale.",chapter:"Chapter V The Rescue of the Tin Woodman",first_line:76,last_line:165,text:`The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.
"For," he said, "if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I

It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for
soon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place
where the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the
travelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe
and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire
party.
Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not
notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the
side of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up
again.
"Why didn't you walk around the hole?" asked the Tin Woodman.
"I don't know enough," replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. "My head is
stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask
him for some brains."
"Oh, I see," said the Tin Woodman. "But, after all, brains are not the
best things in the world."
"Have you any?" inquired the Scarecrow.
"No, my head is quite empty," answered the Woodman. "But once I had
brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much
rather have a heart."
"And why is that?" asked the Scarecrow.
"I will tell you my story, and then you will know."
So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told
the following story:
"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest
and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a
woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as
long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone
I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.
"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon
grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry
me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for
her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old
woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she
wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the
housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and
promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.
Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping
away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my
wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my
left leg.
"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man
could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and
had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I
was used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for
she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin
girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right
leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of
tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;
but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked
Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I
thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come
along, and he made me a new head out of tin.
"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than
ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a
new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my
axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into
two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body
of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of
joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had
now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did
not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living
with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.
"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and
it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There
was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in
my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,
there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a
rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I
was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a
terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time
to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.
While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can
love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me
one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her."
Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story
of the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a
new heart.
"All the same," said the Scarecrow, "I shall ask for brains instead of
a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had
one."
"I shall take the heart," returned the Tin Woodman; "for brains do not
make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world."
Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her
two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to
Kansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had
no brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.`,length:5571,num_lines:90,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The bond between Dorothy, the Tin Woodman, and the Scarecrow strengthens as they share their stories and support each other.",importance:.9,emotion:"Camaraderie and support",sentiment:1,quote:"It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Identity",role:"The characters express their desires for brains and a heart, reflecting their search for identity and fulfillment.",importance:.8,emotion:"Longing and hope",sentiment:.5,quote:"I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Loss And Regret",role:"The Tin Woodman shares his story of loss, highlighting the emotional weight of losing his heart and love.",importance:.9,emotion:"Sorrow and nostalgia",sentiment:-.5,quote:"the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"The characters show courage in facing their challenges and determination to seek what they believe will make them whole.",importance:.7,emotion:"Bravery and resolve",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one.",importance_rank:4}],number:3,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Dorothy's Concerns",summary:"Dorothy worries about food and her journey.",chapter:"Chapter V The Rescue of the Tin Woodman",first_line:166,last_line:169,text:`What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another

thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were
much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the
walking was not at all good.
There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the
open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there
came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These
sounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know
what made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side,
and did not even bark in return.
"How long will it be," the child asked of the Tin Woodman, "before we
are out of the forest?"
"I cannot tell," was the answer, "for I have never been to the Emerald
City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it
was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the
city where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so
long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while
you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that
will protect you from harm."
"But Toto!" said the girl anxiously. "What will protect him?"
"We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger," replied the Tin
Woodman.
Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the
next moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his
paw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the
road, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,
to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,
although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.
Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the
Lion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when
Dorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed
forward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while
she cried out:
"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a
big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!"
"I didn't bite him," said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw
where Dorothy had hit it.
"No, but you tried to," she retorted. "You are nothing but a big
coward."
"I know it," said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. "I've always
known it. But how can I help it?"
"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like
the poor Scarecrow!"
"Is he stuffed?" asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up
the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into
shape again.
"Of course he's stuffed," replied Dorothy, who was still angry.
"That's why he went over so easily," remarked the Lion. "It astonished
me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?"
"No," said Dorothy, "he's made of tin." And she helped the Woodman up
again.
"That's why he nearly blunted my claws," said the Lion. "When they
scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What
is that little animal you are so tender of?"
"He is my dog, Toto," answered Dorothy.
"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?" asked the Lion.
"Neither. He's a—a—a meat dog," said the girl.
"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look
at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a
coward like me," continued the Lion sadly.
"What makes you a coward?" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in
wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.
"It's a mystery," replied the Lion. "I suppose I was born that way. All
the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for
the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that
if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out
of my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just
roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If
the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,
I should have run myself—I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they
hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them
go."
"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward," said
the Scarecrow.
"I know it," returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip
of his tail. "It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.
But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast."
"Perhaps you have heart disease," said the Tin Woodman.
"It may be," said the Lion.
"If you have," continued the Tin Woodman, "you ought to be glad, for it
proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have
heart disease."
"Perhaps," said the Lion thoughtfully, "if I had no heart I should not
be a coward."
"Have you brains?" asked the Scarecrow.
"I suppose so. I've never looked to see," replied the Lion.
"I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some," remarked the
Scarecrow, "for my head is stuffed with straw."
"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart," said the Woodman.
"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas," added
Dorothy.
"Do you think Oz could give me courage?" asked the Cowardly Lion.
"Just as easily as he could give me brains," said the Scarecrow.
"Or give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.
"Or send me back to Kansas," said Dorothy.
"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you," said the Lion, "for my
life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage."
"You will be very welcome," answered Dorothy, "for you will help to
keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more
cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily."
"They really are," said the Lion, "but that doesn't make me any braver,
and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy."`,length:5821,num_lines:102,location:"Forest",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"The Lion seeks bravery",importance:.9,emotion:"shame and longing",sentiment:0,quote:"It's a mystery...

peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a
beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little
thing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always
careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept
several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his
face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When
Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open
his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly
frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but
she could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was
wrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's basket and
oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as
well as before.
"This will serve me a lesson," said he, "to look where I step. For if I
should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying
rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak."
Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and
when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to
harm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore
he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.
"You people with hearts," he said, "have something to guide you, and

great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that
warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of
their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.
"If you wish," said the Lion, "I will go into the forest and kill a
deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so
peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very
good breakfast."
"Don't! Please don't," begged the Tin Woodman. "I should certainly weep
if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again."
But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no
one ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow
found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so
that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very
kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the
awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded
hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost
as many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how
long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away
from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn
him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came
near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These
kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.`,length:1683,num_lines:25,location:"Forest Campsite",importance:.7,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The characters support each other in a difficult situation.",importance:.8,emotion:"warmth and camaraderie",sentiment:1,quote:"This was very kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Survival",role:"The group finds ways to sustain themselves in the wilderness.",importance:.9,emotion:"resourcefulness and resilience",sentiment:1,quote:"He found a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Fear",role:"The characters experience fear of the unknown and potential danger.",importance:.6,emotion:"anxiety and caution",sentiment:-.5,quote:"He feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Encountering the Ditch",summary:"The travelers find a deep ditch blocking their path.",chapter:"Chapter VII The Journey to the Great Oz",first_line:26,last_line:41,text:`When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling

This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been
walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed
the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either
side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and
looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were
many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none
of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey
must end.
"What shall we do?" asked Dorothy despairingly.
"I haven't the faintest idea," said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook
his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.

the distance carefully in his mind.
"Then we are all right," answered the Scarecrow, "for you can carry us
all over on your back, one at a time."
"Well, I'll try it," said the Lion. "Who will go first?"
"I will," declared the Scarecrow, "for, if you found that you could not
jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly
dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter
so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all."
"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself," said the Cowardly Lion, "but
I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we
will make the attempt."
The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the
edge of the gulf and crouched down.
"Why don't you run and jump?" asked the Scarecrow.
"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things," he replied. Then
giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the
other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,
and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang
across the ditch again.
Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and
climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.
The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and
then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other
side. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then
they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,

dog that has been running too long.`,length:1698,num_lines:28,location:"Gulf Crossing",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"The Lion faces his fears",importance:.9,emotion:"Nervous determination",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself",importance_rank:1},{name:"Teamwork",role:"Characters support each other",importance:.8,emotion:"Supportive camaraderie",sentiment:.7,quote:"Then we are all right, for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Fear",role:"Characters confront their fears",importance:.7,emotion:"Anxious anticipation",sentiment:-.3,quote:"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things.",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Crossing the Tree Bridge",summary:"The group uses a fallen tree to cross another gulf.",chapter:"Chapter VII The Journey to the Great Oz",first_line:70,last_line:124,text:`They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and
gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow
brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would
come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To
add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths
of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part
of the country that the Kalidahs lived.
"What are the Kalidahs?" asked the girl.
"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like
tigers," replied the Lion, "and with claws so long and sharp that they
could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly
afraid of the Kalidahs."
"I'm not surprised that you are," returned Dorothy. "They must be
dreadful beasts."
The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf
across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew
at once he could not leap across it.
So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious
thought the Scarecrow said:
"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman
can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk
across it easily."
"That is a first-rate idea," said the Lion. "One would almost suspect
you had brains in your head, instead of straw."
The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree
was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front
legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big
tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top
branches on the other side.
They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl
made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them
two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.
"They are the Kalidahs!" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.
"Quick!" cried the Scarecrow. "Let us cross over."
So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman
followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was
certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud
and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over
backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him
in surprise.
But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there
were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed
forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they
would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began
to cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:
"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp
claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am
alive."
"Wait a minute!" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was
best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of
the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began
to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly
across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,
snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp
rocks at the bottom.`,length:3260,num_lines:55,location:"Forest",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Fear",role:"The characters are afraid of the Kalidahs, which creates tension.",importance:.9,emotion:"anxiety and dread",sentiment:-.8,quote:"I'm terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Teamwork",role:"The group collaborates to overcome the obstacle of the gulf.",importance:.8,emotion:"determination and hope",sentiment:.6,quote:"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"The Lion shows bravery despite his fear, trying to protect his friends.",importance:.9,emotion:"courage and resolve",sentiment:.7,quote:"I will fight them as long as I am alive.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Obstacle",role:"The characters face and overcome the challenge of the Kalidahs and the gulf.",importance:.9,emotion:"relief and triumph",sentiment:.8,quote:"The tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it.",importance_rank:3}],number:4,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Finding the River",summary:"The travelers discover a river and plan to cross it.",chapter:"Chapter VII The Journey to the Great Oz",first_line:125,last_line:150,text:`"Well," said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, "I see

frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet."
"Ah," said the Tin Woodman sadly, "I wish I had a heart to beat."
This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of
the forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had
to ride on the Lion's back. To their great joy the trees became thinner
the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon
a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of
the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a
beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and
all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They
were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.
"How shall we cross the river?" asked Dorothy.
"That is easily done," replied the Scarecrow. "The Tin Woodman must
build us a raft, so we can float to the other side."
So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make
a raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the
riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had
eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe
fruit.
But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and
untiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.

They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped
off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had
carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the
Emerald City.
"What shall we do now?" asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on
the grass to let the sun dry him.
"We must get back to the road, in some way," said Dorothy.
"The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the
road again," remarked the Lion.
So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they
started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had
carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit
trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for
the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.
They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to
pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:
"Look!"
Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon
his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.
"What can we do to save him?" asked Dorothy.
The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.

"Who are you and where are you going?" asked the Stork.
"I am Dorothy," answered the girl, "and these are my friends, the Tin
Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City."
"This isn't the road," said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and
looked sharply at the queer party.
"I know it," returned Dorothy, "but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are
wondering how we shall get him again."
"Where is he?" asked the Stork.
"Over there in the river," answered the little girl.
"If he wasn't so big and heavy I would get him for you," remarked the
Stork.
"He isn't heavy a bit," said Dorothy eagerly, "for he is stuffed with
straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever
and ever so much."
"Well, I'll try," said the Stork, "but if I find he is too heavy to
carry I shall have to drop him in the river again."
So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to
where the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her
great claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into
the air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin
Woodman and Toto were sitting.
When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so
happy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they
walked along he sang "Tol-de-ri-de-oh!" at every step, he felt so gay.
"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever," he said,
"but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find
the Stork again and do her some kindness in return."
"That's all right," said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.
"I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my
babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald
City and that Oz will help you."

"If we leave her here she will die," said the Lion. "The smell of the
flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and
the dog is asleep already."
It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not
troubled by the scent of the flowers.
"Run fast," said the Scarecrow to the Lion, "and get out of this deadly
flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,
but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried."
So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.
In a moment he was out of sight.
"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her," said the Scarecrow.
So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they
made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms
and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.
On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly
flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of
the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast
asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge
beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance
from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in
beautiful green fields before them.
"We can do nothing for him," said the Tin Woodman, sadly; "for he is
much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and
perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last."
"I'm sorry," said the Scarecrow. "The Lion was a very good comrade for
one so cowardly. But let us go on."
They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far
enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the
poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass
and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.`,length:1980,num_lines:32,location:"Flower Field",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Sacrifice",role:"Characters risk themselves for Dorothy",importance:.9,emotion:"Concern and determination",sentiment:1,quote:"If we leave her here she will die.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"Support among companions",importance:.8,emotion:"Loyalty and sadness",sentiment:.5,quote:"The Lion was a very good comrade for one so cowardly.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"Facing fears and challenges",importance:.7,emotion:"Bravery and struggle",sentiment:.5,quote:"Perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.",importance_rank:3}],number:10,importance_rank:10,conflict_rank:3},{title:"The Wildcat Encounter",summary:"The Tin Woodman saves a mouse from a Wildcat.",chapter:"Chapter IX The Queen of the Field Mice",first_line:1,last_line:16,text:`"We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now," remarked the

The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and
turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange
beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great
yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,
for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,
showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of
fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the
beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he
knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,
harmless creature.
So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a

"Where is Kansas?" asked the man, with surprise.
"I don't know," replied Dorothy sorrowfully, "but it is my home, and
I'm sure it's somewhere."
"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find
Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a
hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he
usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?" he continued, speaking
to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not
speak.
The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered
around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of
scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.
The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it
was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of
everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.
The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside
her, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be
disturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and
kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.

"That must be the Emerald City," said Dorothy.
As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it
seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it
was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the
City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.
In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big
gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even
the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.
There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and
heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly
open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched
room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.
Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He
was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin
was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.
When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, "What do you wish
in the Emerald City?"
"We came here to see the Great Oz," said Dorothy.
The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it
over.
"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz," he said,
shaking his head in perplexity. "He is powerful and terrible, and if
you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of
the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant."
"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one," replied the
Scarecrow; "it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good
Wizard."
"So he is," said the green man, "and he rules the Emerald City wisely
and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from
curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his
face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the
Great Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the
spectacles."
"Why?" asked Dorothy.
"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the
Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear
spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it
when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock
them."
He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with
spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in
them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit
Dorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands
fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they
were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the
Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy
could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish
to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.
Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin
Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast
with the key.
Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he
was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a
peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him
through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.`,length:3408,num_lines:56,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:1,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Journey's End",role:"The arrival at the Emerald City signifies the culmination of their long journey.",importance:1,emotion:"Hopeful anticipation",sentiment:1,quote:"That must be the Emerald City.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Mystery Of Oz",role:"The uncertainty surrounding the Great Oz adds tension to their quest.",importance:.8,emotion:"Curiosity and apprehension",sentiment:0,quote:"He is powerful and terrible.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Illusion Vs Reality",role:"The spectacles symbolize the difference between perception and reality in the Emerald City.",importance:.9,emotion:"Wonder and caution",sentiment:0,quote:"the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Guardianship",role:"The Guardian of the Gates represents the barriers to knowledge and power.",importance:.7,emotion:"Authority and protection",sentiment:1,quote:"I am the Guardian of the Gates.",importance_rank:4}],number:7,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Arrival in the Emerald City",summary:"Dorothy and friends arrive in the vibrant city.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:1,last_line:22,text:`Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her

The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble
and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a
pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined
together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the
brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the
sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were
green.
There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and
these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They
looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering
eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when
they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the
street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy
and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green
hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling
green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that
they paid for it with green pennies.
There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried
things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.
Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.`,length:1405,num_lines:22,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.9,conflict:.1,characters:[{name:"Wonder And Amazement",role:"The characters are amazed by the beauty of the city.",importance:.9,emotion:"Astonishment and Delight",sentiment:1,quote:"Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Uniformity",role:"The city and its inhabitants share a common green theme.",importance:.8,emotion:"Strangeness and Curiosity",sentiment:0,quote:"They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Prosperity",role:"The city appears to be thriving and happy.",importance:.7,emotion:"Contentment",sentiment:1,quote:"Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:9},{title:"Meeting the Guardian of the Gates",summary:"They meet the Guardian and enter the Palace.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:23,last_line:36,text:`The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came

dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.
"Here are strangers," said the Guardian of the Gates to him, "and they
demand to see the Great Oz."
"Step inside," answered the soldier, "and I will carry your message to
him."
So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room
with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The
soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering
this room, and when they were seated he said politely:

When, at
last, he came back, Dorothy asked:
"Have you seen Oz?"
"Oh, no," returned the soldier; "I have never seen him. But I spoke to
him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he
will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must
enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.
Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will
have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your
journey."
"Thank you," replied the girl; "that is very kind of Oz."
The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,
dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely
green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she
said, "Follow me and I will show you your room."
So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the
dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up
three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the
Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft
comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet
counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that
shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a
beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in
the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.
When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer
green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.
In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and
velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.
"Make yourself perfectly at home," said the green girl, "and if you
wish for anything ring the bell.

She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led
to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant
part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the
Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood
stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It
would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he
remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web
in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most
wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from
force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not
being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down
to make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have
preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being
shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so
he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred
himself asleep in a minute.
The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch
Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of
green brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a
green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room
of the Great Oz.
First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen
of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to
do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the
Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see
Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them
whispered:
"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?"
"Of course," answered the girl, "if he will see me."
"Oh, he will see you," said the soldier who had taken her message to
the Wizard, "although he does not like to have people ask to see him.
Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you
came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned
your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about
the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his
presence."
Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, "That is the
signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone."
She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found
herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high
arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with
large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a
great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a
wonderful manner.
But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble
that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and
sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair
was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs
whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose
and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.
As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly
and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and
Dorothy heard a voice say:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big
Head; so she took courage and answered:
"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help."
The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the
voice:
"Where did you get the silver shoes?"
"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on
her and killed her," she replied.
"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?" continued the voice.
"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me
good-bye and sent me to you," said the girl.
Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the
truth. Then Oz asked, "What do you wish me to do?"
"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are," she
answered earnestly. "I don't like your country, although it is so
beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my
being away so long."`,length:4332,num_lines:72,location:"Emerald Palace",importance:1,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"Dorothy faces Oz alone",importance:1,emotion:"nervous yet determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek.

down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see
every part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.
"Why should I do this for you?" asked Oz.
"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard
and I am only a little girl."
"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East," said
Oz.
"That just happened," returned Dorothy simply; "I could not help it."
"Well," said the Head, "I will give you my answer. You have no right to
expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in
return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If
you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do
something for me first. Help me and I will help you."
"What must I do?" asked the girl.
"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West," answered Oz.
"But I cannot!" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.
"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which
bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all
this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to
Kansas—but not before."
The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the
eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz
felt that she could help him if she would.
"I never killed anything, willingly," she sobbed. "Even if I wanted to,
how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,
cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?"
"I do not know," said the Head; "but that is my answer, and until the
Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember
that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed.

and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had
said to her. "There is no hope for me," she said sadly, "for Oz will
not send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and
that I can never do."
Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy
went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to
sleep.
The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the
Scarecrow and said:
"Come with me, for Oz has sent for you."
So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne
Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.
She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green
locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,
gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest
breath of air reached them.
When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would
let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,
and said:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had
told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.
"I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,
and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead
of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your
dominions."
"Why should I do this for you?" asked the Lady.
"Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,"
answered the Scarecrow.
"I never grant favors without some return," said Oz; "but this much I
will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I
will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you
will be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz."
"I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch," said the Scarecrow, in
surprise.

grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned

Oz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard
was not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.
"All the same," said the Scarecrow, "she needs a heart as much as the
Tin Woodman."
On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin
Woodman and said:
"Oz has sent for you. Follow me."
So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He
did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he
hoped it would be the lovely Lady. "For," he said to himself, "if it is
the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no
heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the
lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves
said to be kindly hearted."
But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the
Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.
It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly
strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a
rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long
arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.
Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more
dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the
Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud
and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all
afraid, although he was much disappointed.
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible," spoke the Beast, in a voice that was
one great roar. "Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
"I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot
love. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are."
"Why should I do this?" demanded the Beast.
"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request," answered the
Woodman.
Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: "If you indeed desire a
heart, you must earn it."
"How?" asked the Woodman.
"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West," replied the Beast.
"When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the
biggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz."

at the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the
Lion said:

frighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely
Lady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my
bidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I
will roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us
what we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be
well."
The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to
the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.
The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to
his surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and
glowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was
that Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he
tried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his

Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the
words it spoke:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?"
And the Lion answered, "I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I
came to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may
become the King of Beasts, as men call me."
"Why should I give you courage?" demanded Oz.
"Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to
grant my request," answered the Lion.
The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, "Bring
me proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you
courage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward."`,length:1820,num_lines:30,location:"Emerald Palace",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"The Lion seeks bravery",importance:1,emotion:"fearful determination",sentiment:.5,quote:"I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Power Dynamics",role:"Oz's authority is questioned",importance:.8,emotion:"intimidation",sentiment:.3,quote:"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Fear",role:"The Lion's internal struggle",importance:.9,emotion:"anxiety",sentiment:-.5,quote:"Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to grant my request.",importance_rank:2}],number:8,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Decision to Face the Witch",summary:"The group decides to confront the Wicked Witch.",chapter:"Chapter XI The Wonderful City of Oz",first_line:279,last_line:314,text:`The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and
while he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so
furiously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad
to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible
interview with the Wizard.
"What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy sadly.
"There is only one thing we can do," returned the Lion, "and that is to
go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy
her."
"But suppose we cannot?" said the girl.
"Then I shall never have courage," declared the Lion.
"And I shall never have brains," added the Scarecrow.
"And I shall never have a heart," spoke the Tin Woodman.
"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry," said Dorothy,
beginning to cry.
"Be careful!" cried the green girl. "The tears will fall on your green
silk gown and spot it."
So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, "I suppose we must try it; but I am
sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again."
"I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch,"
said the Lion.
"I will go too," declared the Scarecrow; "but I shall not be of much
help to you, I am such a fool."
"I haven't the heart to harm even a Witch," remarked the Tin Woodman;
"but if you go I certainly shall go with you."
Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,
and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his
joints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw
and Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The
green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy's basket with
good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto's neck with
a green ribbon.
They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when
they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the
back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a
green egg.`,length:1963,num_lines:36,location:"Emerald Palace",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Courage And Fear",role:"The characters confront their fears about facing the Wicked Witch.",importance:.9,emotion:"anxiety and determination",sentiment:0,quote:"Then I shall never have courage, declared the Lion.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The group supports each other in their quest despite their fears.",importance:.8,emotion:"solidarity and hope",sentiment:1,quote:"I will go with you; but I'm too much of a coward to kill the Witch.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Desire For Home",role:"Dorothy expresses her longing to return home to Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.",importance:.7,emotion:"sadness and longing",sentiment:-1,quote:"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, said Dorothy, beginning to cry.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Journey",role:"The characters prepare for their journey to confront the Wicked Witch.",importance:.6,emotion:"anticipation and readiness",sentiment:0,quote:"Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning.",importance_rank:4}],number:9,importance_rank:9,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Guardian of the Gates",summary:"Dorothy and friends meet the Guardian who warns them about the Wicked Witch.",chapter:"Chapter XII The Search for the Wicked Witch",first_line:1,last_line:17,text:`The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the

off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she
blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.
At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great
wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.
"Go to those people," said the Witch, "and tear them to pieces."
"Are you not going to make them your slaves?" asked the leader of the
wolves.
"No," she answered, "one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and
another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into
small pieces."
"Very well," said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed
by the others.
It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard
the wolves coming.
"This is my fight," said the Woodman, "so get behind me and I will meet
them as they come."
He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of
the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's
head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could
raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp

times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap

whistle twice.
Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough
to darken the sky.
And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, "Fly at once to the
strangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces."
The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her
companions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.
But the Scarecrow said, "This is my battle, so lie down beside me and
you will not be harmed."
So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up
and stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were
frightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare
to come any nearer. But the King Crow said:
"It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out."
The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and
twisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and
the Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty
times the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead

Scarecrow had decided what to do.
"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and
the Lion," he said to the Woodman, "and the bees cannot sting them."
This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held
Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.
The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew
at him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting
the Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are
broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick
about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.

Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the

nor groan.
Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers
pulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat

The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and

on Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged
Monkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked
down at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble
with fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At
first the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened
to look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them
was, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the
Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and
thought, "I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to
use her power." Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:
"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you
do not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the
Scarecrow."
Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle
until they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots
and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as
she could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill
her.
With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the
courtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse
her, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to
go to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and
bounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and
shut the gate again.
"If I cannot harness you," said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through
the bars of the gate, "I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat
until you do as I wish."
So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day
she came to the gate at noon and asked, "Are you ready to be harnessed
like a horse?"
And the Lion would answer, "No. If you come in this yard, I will bite
you."
The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that
every night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from
the cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,
and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy
mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to
escape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was
constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the
Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.
The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch
threatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in
her hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of
the mark upon her forehead.

Shoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves
were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of
the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,
they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.
She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,
thinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty
shoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took
her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in
Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was
greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy
was bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let
water touch her in any way.
But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a
trick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in
the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the
iron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the
floor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at
full length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver
Shoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched
it away and put it on her own skinny foot.
The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for
as long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their
charm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how
to do so.
The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew
angry, and said to the Witch, "Give me back my shoe!"
"I will not," retorted the Witch, "for it is now my shoe, and not
yours."
"You are a wicked creature!" cried Dorothy. "You have no right to take
my shoe from me."
"I shall keep it, just the same," said the Witch, laughing at her, "and
someday I shall get the other one from you, too."
This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water
that stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to
foot.
Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as
Dorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall
away.
"See what you have done!" she screamed. "In a minute I shall melt
away."
"I'm very sorry, indeed," said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see
the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.
"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?" asked the Witch, in a
wailing, despairing voice.
"Of course not," answered Dorothy. "How should I?"
"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the
castle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a
little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked
deeds. Look out—here I go!"
With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass
and began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing
that she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket
of water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the
door. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of
the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her
foot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to
the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had
come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange
land.`,length:3563,num_lines:60,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:1,conflict:1,characters:[{name:"Power Dynamics",role:"The Witch seeks control over Dorothy's shoes to regain power.",importance:1,emotion:"Desperation and greed",sentiment:-1,quote:"If she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Cunning And Deceit",role:"The Witch uses trickery to try to steal the shoe from Dorothy.",importance:1,emotion:"Cunning and malice",sentiment:-1,quote:"She placed a bar of iron in the middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human eyes.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Fear",role:"The Witch's fear of water ultimately leads to her downfall.",importance:1,emotion:"Fear and despair",sentiment:-1,quote:"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?",importance_rank:3},{name:"Defiance And Courage",role:"Dorothy stands up to the Witch and fights back.",importance:1,emotion:"Anger and determination",sentiment:1,quote:"You are a wicked creature!

So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to
rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted
to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from
bondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they
knew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and
part of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin
Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade
was rusted and the handle broken off short.
The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to
the Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the
sad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.
When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:
"Are any of your people tinsmiths?"
"Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths," they told her.
"Then bring them to me," she said. And when the tinsmiths came,
bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, "Can you
straighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into
shape again, and solder him together where he is broken?"
The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that
they thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So
they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and
worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and
bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body
and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into
his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there
were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as
the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.
When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for
rescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy
had to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his
joints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick
and fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears
did not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so
often with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was
obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it
dried.`,length:2548,num_lines:40,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.9,conflict:.4,characters:[{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The bond between characters strengthens as they rescue the Tin Woodman.",importance:1,emotion:"Joy and relief",sentiment:1,quote:"I should be quite happy.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Rescue Mission",role:"The act of saving the Tin Woodman highlights bravery and teamwork.",importance:.8,emotion:"Determination",sentiment:1,quote:"We can try.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Compassion",role:"Dorothy and the Lion show empathy for the Tin Woodman's condition.",importance:.9,emotion:"Sadness and joy",sentiment:1,quote:"Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight of her old friend.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Restoration",role:"The process of fixing the Tin Woodman symbolizes hope and renewal.",importance:.7,emotion:"Hope",sentiment:1,quote:"They thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.",importance_rank:4}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Repairing the Tin Woodman",summary:"The Winkies mend the Tin Woodman.",chapter:"Chapter XIII The Rescue",first_line:51,last_line:66,text:`"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again," said the Tin Woodman,

So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and
part of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of
which the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.
It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could
climb it; but the Woodman said at once, "I'll chop it down, and then we
can get the Scarecrow's clothes."
Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,
another of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of
solid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old
broken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed
and it glistened like burnished silver.

days at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to
make them comfortable.
But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, "We must go back to
Oz, and claim his promise."
"Yes," said the Woodman, "at last I shall get my heart."
"And I shall get my brains," added the Scarecrow joyfully.
"And I shall get my courage," said the Lion thoughtfully.
"And I shall get back to Kansas," cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.
"Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!"
This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together
and bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and
they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay
and rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were
determined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden
collar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with
diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,
to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a
silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.
Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,
and all shook hands with them until their arms ached.
Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her basket with food for
the journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own
head and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything
about the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so
she made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.
Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald
City; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to
carry with them.`,length:1806,num_lines:29,location:"Wicked Witch's Castle",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The bond between characters strengthens as they prepare to leave.",importance:.9,emotion:"Joyful and grateful",sentiment:1,quote:"The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Journey",role:"The characters embark on a new journey back to Oz.",importance:.8,emotion:"Excitement and anticipation",sentiment:1,quote:"Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!",importance_rank:2},{name:"Generosity",role:"The Winkies show their appreciation through gifts.",importance:.7,emotion:"Warmth and kindness",sentiment:1,quote:"The Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden collar.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Nostalgia",role:"Dorothy reflects on her home and family as they prepare to leave.",importance:.6,emotion:"Longing and determination",sentiment:.5,quote:"But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, 'We must go back to Oz, and claim his promise.'",importance_rank:4}],number:5,importance_rank:5,conflict_rank:5},{title:"Lost in the Fields",summary:"The travelers realize they are lost and seek help.",chapter:"Chapter XIV The Winged Monkeys",first_line:1,last_line:33,text:`You will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the
castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four
travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so
sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to
find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow
daisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go
straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right
way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know
which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were
lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night
the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet
smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the
Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.
The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if
they were quite sure which way they were going.
"If we walk far enough," said Dorothy, "I am sure we shall sometime
come to some place."
But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but
the scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.
"We have surely lost our way," he said, "and unless we find it again in
time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains."
"Nor I my heart," declared the Tin Woodman. "It seems to me I can
scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long
journey."
"You see," said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, "I haven't the
courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all."
Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her
companions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that
for the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly
that flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked
at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.
"Suppose we call the field mice," she suggested. "They could probably
tell us the way to the Emerald City."`,length:2048,num_lines:33,location:"Flower Field",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Lost Direction",role:"The travelers struggle to find their way back to the Emerald City.",importance:.9,emotion:"Frustration and confusion",sentiment:-.5,quote:"We have surely lost our way.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Desire For Home",role:"The characters express their desire to reach their goals and return home.",importance:.8,emotion:"Hope mixed with despair",sentiment:.2,quote:"If we walk far enough, I am sure we shall sometime come to some place.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Team Support",role:"The group relies on each other for encouragement during their journey.",importance:.7,emotion:"Camaraderie",sentiment:.5,quote:"Suppose we call the field mice.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Calling the Winged Monkeys",summary:"Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged Monkeys.",chapter:"Chapter XIV The Winged Monkeys",first_line:34,last_line:68,text:`"To be sure they could," cried the Scarecrow. "Why didn't we think of
that before?"
Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck
since the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they
heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came
running up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her
squeaky little voice:
"What can I do for my friends?"
"We have lost our way," said Dorothy. "Can you tell us where the
Emerald City is?"
"Certainly," answered the Queen; "but it is a great way off, for you
have had it at your backs all this time." Then she noticed Dorothy's
Golden Cap, and said, "Why don't you use the charm of the Cap, and call
the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in
less than an hour."
"I didn't know there was a charm," answered Dorothy, in surprise. "What
is it?"
"It is written inside the Golden Cap," replied the Queen of the Mice.
"But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for
they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us."
"Won't they hurt me?" asked the girl anxiously.
"Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!" And she
scampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.
Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon
the lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the
directions carefully and put the Cap upon her head.
"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!" she said, standing on her left foot.
"What did you say?" asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was
doing.
"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!" Dorothy went on, standing this time on her
right foot.
"Hello!" replied the Tin Woodman calmly.
"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!" said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.
This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering
and flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.`,length:1924,num_lines:35,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.4,characters:[{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"Support from the Queen of Mice",importance:.7,emotion:"Hopeful and grateful",sentiment:.8,quote:"What can I do for my friends?",importance_rank:3},{name:"Discovery",role:"Learning about the charm",importance:.6,emotion:"Surprise and curiosity",sentiment:.5,quote:"I didn't know there was a charm.",importance_rank:4},{name:"Journey",role:"Journey to Emerald City",importance:.9,emotion:"Excitement and determination",sentiment:.7,quote:"Can you tell us where the Emerald City is?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Magic",role:"Use of the Golden Cap",importance:.8,emotion:"Wonder and anticipation",sentiment:.6,quote:"These, she thought, must be the charm.",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:4},{title:"The Story of the Monkeys",summary:"The King of the Monkeys shares their history and curse.",chapter:"Chapter XIV The Winged Monkeys",first_line:69,last_line:141,text:`The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, "What is your command?"
"We wish to go to the Emerald City," said the child, "and we have lost

"We will carry you," replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than
two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.
Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little
Monkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to
bite him.
The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for
they remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;
but they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air
quite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and
woods far below them.
Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,
one of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and
were careful not to hurt her.
"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?" she asked.
"That is a long story," answered the King, with a winged laugh; "but as
we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you
about it, if you wish."
"I shall be glad to hear it," she replied.
"Once," began the leader, "we were a free people, living happily in the
great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and
doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some
of us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull
the tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing
nuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and
happy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was
many years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this
land.
"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who
was also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the
people, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name
was Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great
blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that
she could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much
too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,
however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his
years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she
would make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used
all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any
woman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,
was said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly
beauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to
make everything ready for the wedding.
"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which
lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a
joke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my
grandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking
beside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and
purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could
do. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in
their arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then
dropped him into the water.
"'Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, 'and see if the
water has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim,
and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He
laughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.
But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and
velvet all ruined by the river.
"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had
all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that
their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had
treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded
hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings
tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette
finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever
after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This
Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to
have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and
all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how
it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the
Golden Cap, whosoever he may be."`,length:4595,num_lines:73,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Obedience",role:"The Monkeys must obey commands",importance:.9,emotion:"Resigned",sentiment:0,quote:"we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap",importance_rank:1},{name:"Freedom",role:"The Monkeys reminisce about their past",importance:.7,emotion:"Nostalgic",sentiment:.5,quote:"we were a free people, living happily in the great forest",importance_rank:3},{name:"Love",role:"Gayelette's unrequited love story",importance:.6,emotion:"Sorrowful",sentiment:-.5,quote:"her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return",importance_rank:4},{name:"Magic",role:"The role of magic in the story",importance:.8,emotion:"Mysterious",sentiment:.5,quote:"she used all her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Arrival at the Emerald City",summary:"The travelers arrive at the Emerald City with the help of the Monkeys.",chapter:"Chapter XIV The Winged Monkeys",first_line:142,last_line:163,text:`"And what became of them?" asked Dorothy, who had been greatly
interested in the story.
"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap," replied the Monkey,
"he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not
bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he
had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never
again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we
were all afraid of her.
"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the
hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,
and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the
Golden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your
wishes upon us."
As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the
green, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at
the rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The
strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of
the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,
followed by all his band.

the bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same
Guardian of the Gates they had met before.
"What! are you back again?" he asked, in surprise.
"Do you not see us?" answered the Scarecrow.
"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West."
"We did visit her," said the Scarecrow.
"And she let you go again?" asked the man, in wonder.
"She could not help it, for she is melted," explained the Scarecrow.
"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed," said the man. "Who melted
her?"
"It was Dorothy," said the Lion gravely.
"Good gracious!" exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before
her.
Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from
the great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward
they passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people
heard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked
Witch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed
them in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.
The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,
but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful
green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they
might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.
The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the
other travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;
but Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them
at once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor
the next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at
last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,
after sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow
at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if
he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged
Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.
When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he
sent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after
nine o'clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in
the Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.
The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift
Oz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and
then she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how
glad she was to have her little girl at home again.
Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier
came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room
of the Great Oz.
Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he
had taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about
and saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and
closer to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more
dreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.
Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere
near the top of the great dome, and it said:
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?"
They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,
Dorothy asked, "Where are you?"
"I am everywhere," answered the Voice, "but to the eyes of common
mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you
may converse with me." Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come
straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in
a row while Dorothy said:
"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz."
"What promise?" asked Oz.
"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was
destroyed," said the girl.
"And you promised to give me brains," said the Scarecrow.
"And you promised to give me a heart," said the Tin Woodman.
"And you promised to give me courage," said the Cowardly Lion.
"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?" asked the Voice, and Dorothy
thought it trembled a little.
"Yes," she answered, "I melted her with a bucket of water."
"Dear me," said the Voice, "how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for
I must have time to think it over."
"You've had plenty of time already," said the Tin Woodman angrily.
"We shan't wait a day longer," said the Scarecrow.
"You must keep your promises to us!" exclaimed Dorothy.
The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave
a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped
away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a
corner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next
moment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in
just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head
and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.
The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and
cried out, "Who are you?"
"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible," said the little man, in a trembling
voice. "But don't strike me—please don't—and I'll do anything you want
me to."
Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.
"I thought Oz was a great Head," said Dorothy.
"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady," said the Scarecrow.
"And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast," said the Tin Woodman.
"And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire," exclaimed the Lion.
"No, you are all wrong," said the little man meekly. "I have been
making believe."
"Making believe!" cried Dorothy. "Are you not a Great Wizard?"
"Hush, my dear," he said. "Don't speak so loud, or you will be
overheard—and I should be ruined. I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard."
"And aren't you?" she asked.
"Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man."
"You're more than that," said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; "you're
a humbug."
"Exactly so!" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if
it pleased him. "I am a humbug."
"But this is terrible," said the Tin Woodman. "How shall I ever get my
heart?"
"Or I my courage?" asked the Lion.
"Or I my brains?" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes
with his coat sleeve.
"My dear friends," said Oz, "I pray you not to speak of these little
things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found
out."
"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?" asked Dorothy.
"No one knows it but you four—and myself," replied Oz. "I have fooled
everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a
great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will
not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible."
"But, I don't understand," said Dorothy, in bewilderment. "How was it
that you appeared to me as a great Head?"
"That was one of my tricks," answered Oz. "Step this way, please, and I
will tell you all about it."
He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and
they all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great
Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully
painted face.
"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire," said Oz. "I stood behind the
screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open."
"But how about the voice?" she inquired.
"Oh, I am a ventriloquist," said the little man. "I can throw the sound
of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of
the Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you." He showed
the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be
the lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was
nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their
sides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also
from the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was
poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.
"Really," said the Scarecrow, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
being such a humbug."
"I am—I certainly am," answered the little man sorrowfully; "but it was
the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of
chairs; and I will tell you my story."
So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.
"I was born in Omaha—"
"Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!" cried Dorothy.
"No, but it's farther from here," he said, shaking his head at her
sadly. "When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very
well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or
beast." Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears
and looked everywhere to see where she was. "After a time," continued
Oz, "I tired of that, and became a balloonist."
"What is that?" asked Dorothy.
"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of
people together and get them to pay to see the circus," he explained.
"Oh," she said, "I know."
"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so
that I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so
far that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles
away. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the
morning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a
strange and beautiful country.
"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself
in the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,
thought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because
they were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.
"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to
build this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.
Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call
it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green
spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green."
"But isn't everything here green?" asked Dorothy.
"No more than in any other city," replied Oz; "but when you wear green
spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The
Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man
when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my
people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them
think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful
place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing
that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and
they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself
up and would not see any of them.
"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical
powers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do
wonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they
ruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.
Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew
they would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were
terribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they
themselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in
deadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I
was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.
When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would
only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I
am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises."
"I think you are a very bad man," said Dorothy.
"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad
Wizard, I must admit."
"Can't you give me brains?" asked the Scarecrow.
"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has
brains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that
brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience
you are sure to get."
"That may all be true," said the Scarecrow, "but I shall be very
unhappy unless you give me brains."
The false Wizard looked at him carefully.
"Well," he said with a sigh, "I'm not much of a magician, as I said;
but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head
with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find
that out for yourself."
"Oh, thank you—thank you!" cried the Scarecrow. "I'll find a way to use
them, never fear!"
"But how about my courage?" asked the Lion anxiously.
"You have plenty of courage, I am sure," answered Oz. "All you need is
confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid
when it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are
afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty."
"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same," said the Lion. "I shall
really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that
makes one forget he is afraid."
"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow," replied Oz.
"How about my heart?" asked the Tin Woodman.
"Why, as for that," answered Oz, "I think you are wrong to want a
heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in
luck not to have a heart."
"That must be a matter of opinion," said the Tin Woodman. "For my part,
I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me
the heart."
"Very well," answered Oz meekly. "Come to me tomorrow and you shall
have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well
continue the part a little longer."
"And now," said Dorothy, "how am I to get back to Kansas?"
"We shall have to think about that," replied the little man. "Give me
two or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to
carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as
my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon
you and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in
return for my help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no
one I am a humbug."
They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to
their rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that "The Great and
Terrible Humbug," as she called him, would find a way to send her back`,length:14210,num_lines:240,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:1,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Deception",role:"Oz reveals his true identity as a humbug.",importance:1,emotion:"surprise and dismay",sentiment:-1,quote:"I am just a common man.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Hope And Despair",role:"The travelers hope for their promised gifts but face uncertainty.",importance:1,emotion:"anxiety and anticipation",sentiment:0,quote:"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Courage And Fear",role:"The Lion seeks courage despite his fears.",importance:1,emotion:"fear and determination",sentiment:0,quote:"I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that makes one forget he is afraid.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"The travelers support each other in their quest.",importance:1,emotion:"solidarity and support",sentiment:1,quote:"They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned.",importance_rank:4}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Scarecrow's Wish",summary:"The Scarecrow expresses his desire for brains.",chapter:"Chapter XVI The Magic Art of the Great Humbug",first_line:1,last_line:29,text:`Next morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:

return I shall be as other men are."
"I have always liked you as you were," said Dorothy simply.
"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow," he replied. "But surely you
will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain
is going to turn out." Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful
voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.
"Come in," said Oz.
The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the
window, engaged in deep thought.
"I have come for my brains," remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.
"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please," replied Oz. "You must excuse
me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put
your brains in their proper place."
"That's all right," said the Scarecrow. "You are quite welcome to take
my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on
again."
So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he
entered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed
with a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together
thoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture
and stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.
When he had fastened the Scarecrow's head on his body again he said to
him, "Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of
bran-new brains."
The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his
greatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his
friends.`,length:1645,num_lines:29,location:"Emerald Palace",importance:.9,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Self-improvement",role:"The Scarecrow seeks to become smarter",importance:.9,emotion:"Hopeful and excited",sentiment:.8,quote:"I am going to Oz to get my brains at last.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"Dorothy supports the Scarecrow",importance:.7,emotion:"Supportive and caring",sentiment:.9,quote:"I have always liked you as you were.",importance_rank:3},{name:"Transformation",role:"The Scarecrow undergoes a physical change",importance:.8,emotion:"Proud and fulfilled",sentiment:.9,quote:"Hereafter you will be a great man.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Tin Woodman's Heart",summary:"The Tin Woodman receives a heart from Oz.",chapter:"Chapter XVI The Magic Art of the Great Humbug",first_line:38,last_line:63,text:`"Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart," said the Woodman.

"Come in," called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, "I have come

"Very well," answered the little man. "But I shall have to cut a hole
in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it
won't hurt you."
"Oh, no," answered the Woodman. "I shall not feel it at all."
So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole
in the left side of the Tin Woodman's breast. Then, going to a chest of
drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed
with sawdust.
"Isn't it a beauty?" he asked.
"It is, indeed!" replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. "But is
it a kind heart?"
"Oh, very!" answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and
then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it
had been cut.
"There," said he; "now you have a heart that any man might be proud of.
I'm sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn't
be helped."
"Never mind the patch," exclaimed the happy Woodman. "I am very

sniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:
"Drink."
"What is it?" asked the Lion.
"Well," answered Oz, "if it were inside of you, it would be courage.

I advise you to drink it as soon as possible."

I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the

across the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my
powers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I
believe I can make a balloon."
"How?" asked Dorothy.
"A balloon," said Oz, "is made of silk, which is coated with glue to
keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be
no trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas
to fill the balloon with, to make it float."
"If it won't float," remarked Dorothy, "it will be of no use to us."
"True," answered Oz. "But there is another way to make it float, which
is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the
air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we
should be lost."
"We!" exclaimed the girl. "Are you going with me?"
"Yes, of course," replied Oz. "I am tired of being such a humbug. If I
should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a
Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.
So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.
I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again."
"I shall be glad to have your company," said Dorothy.

together, we will begin to work on our balloon."`,length:1572,num_lines:26,location:"Desert",importance:.8,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Journey",role:"The quest to cross the desert",importance:.9,emotion:"hopeful and determined",sentiment:.7,quote:"How can I cross the desert?",importance_rank:1},{name:"Friendship And Loyalty",role:"Dorothy and Oz's bond",importance:.8,emotion:"supportive and collaborative",sentiment:.8,quote:"I shall be glad to have your company.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Courage And Determination",role:"Facing the unknown",importance:.7,emotion:"anxious yet brave",sentiment:.6,quote:"If it won't float, it will be of no use to us.",importance_rank:3}],number:3,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Preparing for Departure",summary:"Oz prepares to leave and addresses the people.",chapter:"Chapter XVII How the Balloon Was Launched",first_line:47,last_line:72,text:`So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips
of silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First
there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and
then a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon
in different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew
all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of
green silk more than twenty feet long.
Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it
airtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.
"But we must have a basket to ride in," he said. So he sent the soldier
with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened
with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.
When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to
make a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The
news spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the
wonderful sight.
Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the
people gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a
big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom
of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it
would be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out
and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the
ground.

Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I
remember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer's
cornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am
quite satisfied with my lot."
"I also," said the Tin Woodman, "am well-pleased with my new heart;
and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world."
"For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that
ever lived, if not braver," said the Lion modestly.

"Well, then, what can be done?" inquired the Woodman.
The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins
and needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:
"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the
desert?"
"I never thought of that!" said Dorothy joyfully. "It's just the thing.
I'll go at once for the Golden Cap."
When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and
soon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and
stood beside her.
"This is the second time you have called us," said the Monkey King,
bowing before the little girl. "What do you wish?"
"I want you to fly with me to Kansas," said Dorothy.
But the Monkey King shook his head.
"That cannot be done," he said. "We belong to this country alone, and
cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,
and I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We
shall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross

The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly
that Dorothy feared it would burst.
"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers," he said, "and ask
his advice."
So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for
while Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.
"This little girl," said the Scarecrow to the soldier, "wishes to cross
the desert. How can she do so?"
"I cannot tell," answered the soldier, "for nobody has ever crossed the
desert, unless it is Oz himself."
"Is there no one who can help me?" asked Dorothy earnestly.
"Glinda might," he suggested.
"Who is Glinda?" inquired the Scarecrow.
"The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,
and rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of
the desert, so she may know a way to cross it."
"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?" asked the child.
"The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier, "and she is kind
to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows
how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."
"How can I get to her castle?" asked Dorothy.
"The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but it is said to be
full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a
race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For
this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City."
The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:
"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is
to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of
course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas."
"You must have been thinking again," remarked the Tin Woodman.
"I have," said the Scarecrow.
"I shall go with Dorothy," declared the Lion, "for I am tired of your
city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild
beast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her."
"That is true," agreed the Woodman. "My axe may be of service to her;
so I also will go with her to the Land of the South."
"When shall we start?" asked the Scarecrow.
"Are you going?" they asked, in surprise.
"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains.
She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the
Emerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never
leave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all."

I should like to start as soon as possible."

such wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass
underneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under
the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next
minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his
fellow travelers.
This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked
rather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.
"Here is another space between the trees," called the Lion.
"Let me try it first," said the Scarecrow, "for it doesn't hurt me to
get thrown about." He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its
branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.

roughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped
at it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking
all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under
it.
"Come on!" he shouted to the others. "Be quick!" They all ran forward

The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came
to the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found
before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was
smooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.
"What shall we do now?" asked Dorothy.

The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:
"I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of."
"Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall," replied the
Woodman. "When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the
other side."
After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin
Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The
Scarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the
ladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was
so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from
falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the
Scarecrow said, "Oh, my!"
"Go on," exclaimed Dorothy.
So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the
wall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, "Oh, my!" just as the
Scarecrow had done.
Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him
be still.
The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but
both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as soon as they looked over the wall.
When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked
down and saw a strange sight.
Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and
shining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were
many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.
These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as
high as Dorothy's waist. There were also pretty little barns, with
china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs
and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.
But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer
country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored
bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most
gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in
knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and
golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon
their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns
in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,
pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of
china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of
them was no higher than Dorothy's knee.`,length:2636,num_lines:43,location:"Land Of Oz",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Curiosity",role:"The characters are intrigued by the wall and what lies beyond it.",importance:.7,emotion:"Wonder and excitement",sentiment:.8,quote:"I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Discovery",role:"The characters discover a new and strange land filled with china people and houses.",importance:.9,emotion:"Amazement",sentiment:.9,quote:"Oh, my!",importance_rank:1},{name:"Journey",role:"The journey continues as they explore the new land.",importance:.6,emotion:"Eager anticipation",sentiment:.7,quote:"When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the other side.",importance_rank:3}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Encounter with the Milkmaid",summary:"Dorothy accidentally breaks a china cow's leg.",chapter:"Chapter XX The Dainty China Country",first_line:44,last_line:74,text:`No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little

"How shall we get down?" asked Dorothy.
They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the
Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that
the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not
to light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were
safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite
flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.
"We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,"
said Dorothy, "for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except
due South."
They began walking through the country of the china people, and the
first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As
they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,
the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china
ground with a great clatter.
Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and
that the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor
milkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.
"There!" cried the milkmaid angrily. "See what you have done! My cow
has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have
it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my
cow?"
"I'm very sorry," returned Dorothy. "Please forgive us."
But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She
picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping
on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful
glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked

Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But
the china girl cried out:
"Don't chase me! Don't chase me!"
She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,
"Why not?"
"Because," answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,
"if I run I may fall down and break myself."
"But could you not be mended?" asked the girl.
"Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,"
replied the Princess.
"I suppose not," said Dorothy.
"Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns," continued the china lady,
"who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so
often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all
pretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself."
Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy
could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and
green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way
and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.
The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his
cheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:
"My lady fair,
Why do you stare
At poor old Mr. Joker?
You're quite as stiff
And prim as if
You'd eaten up a poker!"
"Be quiet, sir!" said the Princess. "Can't you see these are strangers,
and should be treated with respect?"
"Well, that's respect, I expect," declared the Clown, and immediately
stood upon his head.
"Don't mind Mr. Joker," said the Princess to Dorothy. "He is
considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish."
"Oh, I don't mind him a bit," said Dorothy. "But you are so beautiful,"
she continued, "that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won't you let
me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could
carry you in my basket."
"That would make me very unhappy," answered the china Princess. "You
see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move
around as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints
at once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of
course that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and
cabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter
here in our own country."

the hill, nevertheless."
So he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the
first rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, "Keep back!"
"Who are you?" asked the Scarecrow.
Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, "This
hill belongs to us, and we don't allow anyone to cross it."
"But we must cross it," said the Scarecrow. "We're going to the country
of the Quadlings."
"But you shall not!" replied the voice, and there stepped from behind
the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.
He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the
top and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms
at all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a
creature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, "I'm
sorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether
you like it or not," and he walked boldly forward.
As quick as lightning the man's head shot forward and his neck
stretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the
Scarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the
hill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and
the man laughed harshly as he said, "It isn't as easy as you think!"
