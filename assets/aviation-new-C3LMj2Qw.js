The Andalusian scientist Abbas ibn Firnas (810–887 AD) attempted to fly in
Córdoba, Spain, by covering his body with vulture feathers and attached two
wings to his arms. The 17th-century Algerian historian Ahmed Mohammed
al-Maqqari, quoting a poem by Muhammad I of Córdoba's 9th-century court poet
Mu'min ibn Said, recounts that Firnas flew some distance before landing with
some injuries, attributed to his lacking a tail (as birds use them to land). In
the 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that Eilmer of Malmesbury, an
11th-century Benedictine monk, attached wings to his hands and feet and flew a
short distance, but broke both legs while landing, also having neglected to
make himself a tail.

The reason these materials were so perfect for building kites is largely due to
the structure of the materials themselves. Bamboo being a strong, hollow
material, largely resembled the hollow bones in birds, which allow for less
weight, making flight easier. Some kites were fitted with strings and whistles
to make musical sounds while flying. Ancient and mediaeval Chinese sources
describe kites being used to measure distances, test the wind, lift men,
signal, and communicate and send messages. Later designs often depicted images
of flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical.

of rational aircraft design. Most notable of these was Leonardo da Vinci,
although his work remained unknown until 1797, and so had no influence on
developments over the next three hundred years. While his designs are rational,
they are not scientific. He particularly underestimated the amount of power
that would be needed to propel a flying object, basing his designs on the
flapping wings of a bird rather than an engine-powered propeller.
Leonardo studied bird and bat flight, claiming the superiority of the latter
owing to its unperforated wing. He analyzed these and anticipated many
principles of aerodynamics. He understood that "An object offers as much
resistance to the air as the air does to the object." Isaac Newton later
defined this as the third law of motion in 1687.
From the last years of the 15th century until 1505, Leonardo wrote about and
sketched many designs for flying machines and mechanisms, including
ornithopters, fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft (perhaps inspired by whirligig
toys), parachutes (in the form of a wooden-framed pyramidal tent) and a wind
speed gauge. His early designs were man-powered and included ornithopters and
rotorcraft; however, he came to realise the impracticality of this and later
turned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a
spring.
In an essay titled Sul volo (On flight), Leonardo describes a flying machine
called "the bird" which he built from starched linen, leather joints, and raw
silk thongs. In the Codex Atlanticus, he wrote, "Tomorrow morning, on the
second day of January 1496, I will make the thong and the attempt." According

called dirigibles today.
Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically
throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained
lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when Henri
Giffard flew 15 miles (24 km) in France, with a steam engine-driven craft.
Another advancement was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable
free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, La France, by
Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs. The 170-foot (52 m) long, 66,000-cubic-foot
(1,900 m3) airship covered 8 km (5.0 mi) in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8½
horsepower electric motor.
However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail.
Routine, controlled flights did not occur until the advent of the internal
combustion engine.
The first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships
(sometimes called "blimps".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this
type of aircraft was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively
combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he
flew his airship Number 6 over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the
Eiffel Tower and back in under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe
prize. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The
subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard
to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.
At the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success,
the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These were far
more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo-carrying capacity
for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German
count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.
Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly
hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, Friedrichshafen. This was
intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned
with the wind. The prototype airship LZ 1 (LZ for "Luftschiff Zeppelin") had a
length of 128 m (420 ft), was driven by two 10.6 kW (14.2 hp) Daimler engines
and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.
Its first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was
forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight
had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent
flights, bettering the 6 m/s speed attained by the French airship La France by
3 m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It was several years
before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.
The German airship passenger service known as DELAG (Deutsche-Luftschiffahrts
AG) was established in 1910.
Although airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a
limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by
heavier-than-air craft.`,length:3104,num_lines:45,location:"Aviation History",importance:.5,conflict:0,characters:[{name:"Alberto Santos-dumont",importance:.8,importance_exp:"Key figure in airship development",emotion:"Proud and accomplished",sentiment:.8,quote:"Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Ferdinand Von Zeppelin",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Pioneered rigid airship design",emotion:"Determined and innovative",sentiment:.7,quote:"Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Lagari's Rocket Launch",summary:"Evliya Çelebi recounts Lagari's rocket flight.",chapter:"### 17th and 18th centuries",first_line:1,last_line:10,explanation:"Start of chapter",text:`Traveller Evliya Çelebi reported that in 1633, Ottoman scientist and engineer

George Cayley was first called the "father of the aeroplane" in 1846. During
the last years of the 18th century, he had begun the first rigorous study of
the physics of flight and would later design the first modern heavier-than-air
craft. Among his many achievements, his most important contributions to
aeronautics include:
Cayley's research on the aeroplane aimed to address the four fundamental areas
that are essential to aeronautics: propulsion, structural design, aerodynamics,
and stability and control. His work laid the groundwork for a comprehensive
understanding of these critical components, which continue to be vital in the
field today.
Cayley's first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting
the whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple
aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a
complete design.
In 1799, he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying
machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.
In 1804, Cayley constructed a model glider, which was the first modern
heavier-than-air flying machine. It had the layout of a conventional modern
aircraft, with an inclined wing towards the front and an adjustable tail at the
back with both tailplane and fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the
model's centre of gravity.
In 1809, goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries, he began the
publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled "On Aerial Navigation"
(1809–1810). In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, "The
whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a
given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air". He
identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift,
drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs. He also
identified and described the importance of the cambered aerofoil, dihedral,
diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and
design of ornithopters and parachutes.`,length:2147,num_lines:32,location:"George Cayley's Workshop",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"George Cayley",importance:1,importance_exp:"Central figure in the scene",emotion:"Innovative and determined",sentiment:.8,quote:"Cayley's research on the aeroplane aimed to address the four fundamental areas that are essential to aeronautics: propulsion, structural design, aerodynamics, and stability and control.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1}],number:2,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Advancements in Steam Power",summary:"Explores the impact of steam power on aviation.",chapter:"### 19th century",first_line:49,last_line:84,explanation:"Shift to the Age of Steam.",text:`#### Age of steam
Drawing directly from Cayley's work, Henson's 1842 design for an aerial steam
carriage broke new ground. Although only a design, it was the first in history
for a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft.
1866 saw the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain and two
years later the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held at the Crystal
Palace, London, where John Stringfellow was awarded a £100 prize for the steam
engine with the best power-to-weight ratio. In 1848, Stringfellow achieved the
first powered flight using an unmanned 10 feet (3.0 m) wingspan steam-powered
monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two
contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew
ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt
was more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving
thirty yards of straight and level powered flight. Francis Herbert Wenham
presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the
Royal Aeronautical Society), On Aerial Locomotion. He advanced Cayley's work on
cambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had
constructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five
stacked wings. He realised that long, thin wings are better than bat-like ones
because they have more leading edge for their area. Today this relationship is
known as the aspect ratio of a wing.
The latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study,
characterized by the "gentleman scientists" who represented most research
efforts until the 20th century. Among them was the British
scientist-philosopher and inventor Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who studied
lateral flight control and was the first to patent an aileron control system in
1868.
In 1871, Wenham made the first wind tunnel using a fan, driven by a steam
engine, to propel air down a 12 ft (3.7 m) tube to the model.
Meanwhile, the British advances had galvanised French researchers. In 1857,
Félix du Temple proposed a monoplane with a tailplane and retractable
undercarriage. Developing his ideas with a model powered first by clockwork and
later by steam, he eventually achieved a short hop with a full-size manned
craft in 1874. It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a
ramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the
first successful powered glide in history.`,length:2502,num_lines:36,location:"Aviation History",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Francis Herbert Wenham",importance:1,importance_exp:"Significant contributor to aeronautics",emotion:"Innovative and determined",sentiment:1,quote:"He advanced Cayley's work on cambered wings, making important findings.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Matthew Piers Watt Boulton",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Notable inventor in aeronautics",emotion:"Inventive and forward-thinking",sentiment:1,quote:"the first to patent an aileron control system in 1868.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Félix Du Temple",importance:.9,importance_exp:"Pioneer of early powered flight",emotion:"Determined and innovative",sentiment:1,quote:"It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a ramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the first successful powered glide in history.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:3,importance_rank:2,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Theoretical Developments",summary:"Details various theorists and their contributions to flight.",chapter:"### 19th century",first_line:85,last_line:127,explanation:"Focus on theorists and their inventions.",text:`In 1865, Louis Pierre Mouillard published an influential book The Empire Of The
Air (l'Empire de l'Air).
In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first flight higher than his
point of departure, by having his glider "L'Albatros artificiel" pulled by a
horse on a beach. He reportedly achieved a height of 100 metres, over a
distance of 200 metres.
Alphonse Pénaud, a Frenchman, advanced the theory of wing contours and
aerodynamics. He also constructed successful models of aeroplanes, helicopters
and ornithopters. In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed-wing
aeroplane, a model monoplane he called the "Planophore", a distance of 40 m
(130 ft). Pénaud's model incorporated several of Cayley's discoveries,
including the use of a tail, wing dihedral for inherent stability, and rubber
power. The planophore also had longitudinal stability, being trimmed such that
the tailplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings, an
original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics. Pénaud's
later project for an amphibian aeroplane, although never built, incorporated
other modern features. A tailless monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin
tractor propellers, it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces,
retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit.
Another theorist was Frenchman Victor Tatin. In 1879, he flew a model which,
like Pénaud's project, was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also
had a separate horizontal tail. It was powered by compressed air. Flown
tethered to a pole, this was the first model to take off under its own power.
In 1884, Alexandre Goupil published his work La Locomotion Aérienne (Aerial
Locomotion), although the flying machine he later constructed failed to fly.
In 1890, the French engineer Clément Ader completed the first of three
steam-driven flying machines, the Éole. On 9 October 1890, Ader made an
uncontrolled hop of around 50 metres (160 ft); this was the first manned
aeroplane to take off under its own power. His Avion III of 1897, notable only
for having twin steam engines, failed to fly: Ader later claimed success and
was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his
attempt.
Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own
whirling arm rig and wind tunnel and constructed a large machine with a
wingspan of 105 feet (32 m), a length of 145 feet (44 m), fore and aft
horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two
lightweight compound steam engines each delivering 180 hp (130 kW). The overall
weight was 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg). It was intended as a test rig to
investigate aerodynamic lift; because it lacked flight controls it ran on
rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in
1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for about 200
yards at two to three feet of altitude and was badly damaged upon falling back
to the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his`,length:3082,num_lines:43,location:"Aviation History",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Jean-marie Le Bris",importance:.5,importance_exp:"First to achieve flight higher than departure point",emotion:"Innovative and determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"He reportedly achieved a height of 100 metres, over a distance of 200 metres.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Hiram Maxim",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Innovator in aerodynamics and flight testing",emotion:"Determined and inventive",sentiment:.3,quote:"It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift; because it lacked flight controls it ran on rails.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:4,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Early Aeroplane Developments",summary:"Overview of key figures in aeroplane history.",chapter:"### Manned gliders and Otto Lilienthal",first_line:1,last_line:31,explanation:"Start of chapter",text:`Around the last decade of the 19th century, a number of key figures were
refining and defining the modern aeroplane. Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft
work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot
constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly.
It is preserved in the Musee de l'Air, France, and is claimed to be the
earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.
The Englishman Horatio Phillips made key contributions to aerodynamics. He
conducted extensive wind tunnel research on aerofoil sections, proving the
principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings
underpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883 and 1886, the American John
Joseph Montgomery developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting
his own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift.
Otto Lilienthal became known as the "Glider King" or "Flying Man" of Germany.
He duplicated Wenham's work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his
research in 1889 as Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation (Der Vogelflug als
Grundlage der Fliegekunst), which is seen as one of the most important works in
aviation history. He also produced a series of hang gliders, including
bat-wing, monoplane, and biplane forms, such as the Derwitzer Glider and Normal
soaring apparatus, which is considered to be the first airplane in series
production, making the "Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal" the first airplane
production company in the world.
Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered
glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air
machine, stimulating interest around the world. Lilienthal's work led to him
developing the concept of the modern wing. His flights in the year 1891 are
seen as the beginning of human flight and because of that he is often referred
to as either the "father of aviation" or "father of flight".
He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason
is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000
glider flights until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider

linked four of his kites together, added a sling seat, and was the first to
obtain lift with a heavier than air aircraft, when he flew up 16 feet (4.9 m).
Later pioneers of manned kite flying included Samuel Franklin Cody in England
and Captain Génie Saconney in France.

up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold
itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the Aerodrome
immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time.
Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot
responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the Aerodrome's aerial
stability was marginal.

and writings of their predecessors. Their first full-size glider, launched in
1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built
the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the
Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a number of sophisticated
devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested. As a
result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag
and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher
aspect ratio and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of
times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models. By using a
rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils
and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a
working aircraft the following year, the Wright Flyer, but also helped advance
the science of aeronautical engineering.`,length:1278,num_lines:17,location:"Wright Brothers Workshop",importance:.9,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Wright Brothers",importance:1,importance_exp:"They are the main focus of the scene.",emotion:"Determined and innovative",sentiment:.8,quote:"Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher aspect ratio and true three-axis control.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Invention of Wing Warping",summary:"The Wrights solve control problems with wing warping.",chapter:"### Wright brothers",first_line:18,last_line:35,explanation:"Location changes to focus on control innovations.",text:`The Wrights appear to be the first to make serious studied attempts to
simultaneously solve the power and control problems. Both problems proved
difficult, but they never lost interest. They solved the control problem by
inventing wing warping for roll control, combined with simultaneous yaw control
with a steerable rear rudder. Almost as an afterthought, they designed and
built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved
wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to
gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as
a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of
aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a
rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers
appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights' design was greatly
influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to
life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine
power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind.
Performance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design
because the canard could not be highly loaded; anhedral wings were less
affected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability.`,length:1360,num_lines:18,location:"Wright Brothers Workshop",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Wright Brothers",importance:1,importance_exp:"They are the main focus of the scene.",emotion:"Determined and innovative",sentiment:.8,quote:"They never lost interest.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Aviation Pioneers",importance:.5,importance_exp:"They are mentioned in contrast to the Wrights.",emotion:"Irresponsible and reckless",sentiment:-.5,quote:"many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:2,importance_rank:3,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Orville's Flight Description",summary:"Orville describes the details of their first flight.",chapter:"### Wright brothers",first_line:45,last_line:59,explanation:"Location remains at the flight site, focusing on the flight experience.",text:`Orville described the final flight of the day: "The first few hundred feet were

In May 1904 they introduced the Flyer II, a heavier and improved version of the
original Flyer. On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the Flyer
III. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the Flyer III and made
important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the elevator and
rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two
fixed vertical vanes (called "blinkers") between the elevators and gave the
wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the
wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate
control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious
pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so
repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned Flyer III
started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. Flyer III became the first
practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device),

According to the April 1907 issue of the Scientific American magazine, the
Wright brothers seemed to have the most advanced knowledge of heavier-than-air
navigation at the time. However, the same magazine issue also claimed that no
public flight had been made in the United States before its April 1907 issue.

Although the full details of the Wright Brothers' system of flight control had
been published in l'Aerophile in January 1906, the importance of this advance
was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on
attempting to produce inherently stable machines.
Short powered flights were performed in France by Romanian engineer Traian Vuia
on 18 March and 19 August 1906 when he flew 12 and 24 metres, respectively, in
a self-designed, fully self-propelled, fixed-wing aircraft, that possessed a
fully wheeled undercarriage. He was followed by Jacob Ellehammer who built a
monoplane which he tested with a tether in Denmark on 12 September 1906, flying
42 metres.
On 13 September 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made a public flight
in Paris with the 14-bis, also known as Oiseau de proie (French for "bird of
prey"). This was canard configured with a pronounced wing dihedral, and covered
a distance of 60 m (200 ft) on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in
Paris' Bois de Boulogne before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented
event was the first flight verified by the Aéro-Club de France of a powered
heavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the
first officially observed flight greater than 25 m (82 ft). On 12 November
1906, Santos-Dumont set the first world record recognized by the Federation
Aeronautique Internationale by flying 220 m (720 ft) in 21.5 seconds. Only one
more brief flight was made by the 14-bis in March 1907, after which it was
abandoned.`,length:1569,num_lines:23,location:"Chateau De Bagatelle",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Traian Vuia",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Moderately important as he contributed to early flight.",emotion:"Determined and innovative",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Vuia demonstrated determination by successfully flying short distances in his self-designed aircraft.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Jacob Ellehammer",importance:.5,importance_exp:"Moderately important for his contributions to flight.",emotion:"Innovative and experimental",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Ellehammer showed innovation by testing his monoplane design, contributing to the evolution of flight.",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:1,conflict_rank:1},{title:"Flight as an established technology",summary:"Development of flight technology and its recognition.",chapter:"### Pioneer Era (1903–1914)",first_line:32,last_line:68,explanation:"Location change to broader aviation advancements.",text:`#### Flight as an established technology
Santos-Dumont later added ailerons between the wings in an effort to gain more
lateral stability. His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of
Demoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The Demoiselle No 19 could be
constructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production
aircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120 km/h. The fuselage consisted of three
specially reinforced bamboo booms. The pilot sat in a seat between the main
wheels of a conventional landing gear whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were
located at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back
beneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by
a cruciform tail unit hinged on a form of universal joint at the aft end of the
fuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control
provided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping "down".
In 1908, Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a
series of flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. The first demonstration,
made on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French
aviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the
Wright Brothers' aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled
turns. The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by
almost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his
Voisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction
business, whose first product was the influential Farman III biplane.
The following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as
something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics. On 25 July 1909,
Louis Blériot won worldwide fame by winning a £1,000 prize offered by the
British Daily Mail newspaper for a flight across the English Channel, and in
August around half a million people, including the President of France Armand
Fallières and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George,
attended one of the first aviation meetings, the Grande Semaine d'Aviation at
Reims.
In 1914, pioneering aviator Tony Jannus captained the inaugural flight of the
St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, the world's first commercial passenger
airline.
Historians disagree about whether the Wright brothers patent war impeded
development of the aviation industry in the United States compared to Europe.

Almost as soon as they were invented, aeroplanes were used for military
purposes. The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose
aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya
during the Italian-Turkish war (September 1911 – October 1912). This war also
saw Ottoman soldiers shoot down a warplane for the first time in history. The
first warplane reconnaissance mission flown on 23 October 1911 by the Italian
air force's Captain Carlo Piazza, and the first bombing mission was flown on 1
November 1911 by Italy's Second Lieutenant Giolio Gavotti. Bulgaria later
followed this example. Its planes attacked and reconnoitred Ottoman positions
during the First Balkan War 1912–13. The first war to see major use of
aeroplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World
War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used aeroplanes and airships
extensively.
While the concept of using the aeroplane as an offensive weapon was generally
discounted before World War I, the idea of using it for photography was one
that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe
had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached
to their reconnaissance departments. Radiotelephones were also being explored
on aeroplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground
commander grew more and more important.`,length:1453,num_lines:21,location:"Aviation History",importance:.5,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Carlo Piazza",importance:.7,importance_exp:"Key figure in early military aviation",emotion:"Proud and determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"The first warplane reconnaissance mission flown on 23 October 1911 by the Italian air force's Captain Carlo Piazza.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Giolio Gavotti",importance:.6,importance_exp:"Significant role in bombing missions",emotion:"Confident and brave",sentiment:.6,quote:"The first bombing mission was flown on 1 November 1911 by Italy's Second Lieutenant Giolio Gavotti.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:4,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:3},{title:"Combat Schemes",summary:"Introduction to aerial combat innovations during WWI.",chapter:"### World War I (1914–1918)",first_line:1,last_line:20,explanation:"Start of chapter.",text:`#### Combat schemes
It was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of
any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this
problem when, in late 1914, Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the
front of his plane. Adolphe Pegoud became known as the first "ace", getting
credit for five victories before also becoming the first ace to die in action,
it was German Luftstreitkräfte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens who, on 1 July 1915,
scored the very first aerial victory by a purpose-built fighter plane, with a
synchronized machine gun.
Aviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their
enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most
well known is Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the "Red Baron", who shot
down 80 planes in air-to-air combat with several different planes, the most
celebrated of which was the Fokker Dr.I. On the Allied side, René Paul Fonck is
credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are
considered.
France, Britain, Germany, and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter
planes that saw action during the war, with German aviation technologist Hugo
Junkers showing the way to the future through his pioneering use of all-metal

airship safety. The disasters of the U.S. Navy's rigids showed the importance
of solely using helium as the lifting medium. Following the destruction of the
Hindenburg, the remaining airship making international flights, the Graf
Zeppelin was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the rigid airship Graf
Zeppelin II, made a number of flights, primarily over Germany, from 1938 to

invented by Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva and first flown in 1919. In this
design, the rotor is not powered but spins freely as it moves through the air,
while a separate engine powers the aircraft to move forward. This was the basis
of further development and prototypes that led to the creation of the
helicopter. In 1930 Corradino D'Ascanio, an Italian engineer, developed a
coaxial helicopter with the important inclusion of three small propellers on
the craft, which controlled the pitch, roll, and yaw of the aircraft. Later

Large-scale strategic bombing campaigns were launched, fighter escorts
introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks
on small targets with dive bombers, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack
aircraft. New technologies like radar also allowed more coordinated and
controlled deployment of air defence.
The first jet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel He 178 (Germany), flown by Erich
Warsitz in 1939, followed by the world's first operational jet aircraft, the
Messerschmitt Me 262, in July 1942 and world's first jet-powered bomber, the

and more efficient flights.
The British de Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner and was
introduced into scheduled service by 1952. The aircraft was a breakthrough in
technical achievements, but had several intense failures. The square design of
the windows caused stress cracks from metal fatigue, caused by cycles of cabin
pressurization and depressurization. This eventually led to severe structural
failures in the fuel area. These issues were resolved too late, since competing
jet airliners were already flying.
On 15 September 1956, the USSR's airline Aeroflot became the first to offer
continuous, regular jet services using the Tupolev Tu-104. Soon after, Boeing
