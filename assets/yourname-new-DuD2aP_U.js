An alarm? But I'm still sleepy. I was in the zone drawing last night and
didn't get to bed until it was almost dawn.
"...ki... Taki."
Now somebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.A girl?
"Taki, Taki."
Her voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
"Don't you remember me?" the voice asks me anxiously.
No, I don't know you.
Suddenly, the train stops, and the doors open. Oh, right—I was on a train.
The moment I realize this, I'm standing in a packed train car. A pair of wide
eyes hovers right in front of me. A girl in a uniform is staring straight at me, but
the press of disembarking passengers is pushing her farther away.
"My name is Mitsuha!"
The girl shouts, undoing the cord she'd used to tie back her hair and holding
it out to me. Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray
of evening sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that
color tight.
At that point, my eyes open.
The girl's voice—its echoes—still whispers in my ears.
.. .Her name is Mitsuha?
I don't know the name, and I don't know the girl. She looked really
desperate somehow. Her eyes were brimming with tears. I'd never seen the
style of uniform she was wearing. Her expression was serious, even grave, as
if the fate of the universe rested in her hands.
Still, it was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. By the time I think about
it, I can't even remember her face. The echoes in my ears are already gone,
too.`,length:1579,num_lines:29,location:"Train",importance:.7,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Mitsuha Miyamizu",role:"Desperately trying to connect with Taki",importance:1,emotion:"Earnest and pleading",sentiment:.5,quote:"Don't you remember me?",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Taki Tachibana",role:"Confused and sleepy, trying to understand the situation",importance:1,emotion:"Drowsy and bewildered",sentiment:-.2,quote:"No, I don't know you.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:1,importance_rank:6,conflict_rank:4},{title:"Breakfast Banter",summary:"Taki interacts with her sister and grandmother during breakfast.",chapter:"Chapter Two The Beginning",first_line:77,last_line:140,text:`"Sis, you're so late!"
As I open the sliding door and step into the living room, Yotsuha's
accusation flies to greet me.
"I'll fix breakfast tomorrow!" I say by way of apology.
This kid hasn't even lost all her baby teeth yet, but she seems convinced
she's handling life better than her big sister. I can't show weakness by
apologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white
helping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.
"Thanks for the food!"
I pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,
and put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel
eyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.
"So you're normal today, are you?"
"Huh?"
Gran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.
"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!" Yotsuha smirks at me. "Screamin'
all of a sudden like that."
Screaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,
I'm sure).
"Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!"
Seriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.
Ding-dong-ding-do oong.
Suddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.
"Good morning, everyone."
The voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the
Regional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a
dinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either
know each other or at least know someone in common.
"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori."
The slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. "Here
are...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori." There are speakers
outside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and
overlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.
Twice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast
plays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the
daily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how
to contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,
today's funerals.
"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on
the twentieth of next month, the town election management committee
has—"
Click.
The speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's
pulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but
even so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by
her chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.
Picking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts
speaking.
"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only
once every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be
visible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the
corner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation
to study it."
There's a line of text on the screen —Comet Tiamat visible to the naked
eye next month —and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its
momentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and
the NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like
whispered chatter during class.
"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?"
Out of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.
"It's an adult problem," I snap at her.
That's right—this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the
wind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.
Saying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.`,length:3644,num_lines:64,location:"Living Room",importance:.7,conflict:.5,characters:[{name:"Yotsuha",role:"Accuses her sister of being late and mocks her about a previous incident.",importance:.6,emotion:"Playful yet teasing",sentiment:.3,quote:`"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!"`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2},{name:"Gran",role:"Observes and critiques her granddaughter's behavior, showing disapproval.",importance:.5,emotion:"Disapproving and stern",sentiment:-.3,quote:"Even as I'm impressed by her chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:3},{name:"Saya's Sister",role:"Delivers morning announcements, providing context about the town.",importance:.4,emotion:"Neutral and informative",sentiment:0,quote:'"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori."',fake_quote:"",importance_rank:4},{name:"Narrator (sister)",role:"Apologizes for being late and reflects on her younger sister's attitude.",importance:.8,emotion:"Defensive and slightly embarrassed",sentiment:-.1,quote:`"I can't show weakness by apologizing!"`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1}],number:2,importance_rank:7,conflict_rank:5},{title:"School Gossip",summary:"Taki faces gossip and teasing from classmates about her father.",chapter:"Chapter Two The Beginning",first_line:141,last_line:237,text:`The summer copper pheasants are crowing up a storm.
Traveling down the narrow paved path that runs along the hillside and
descending several stone-walled stairways, we emerge from the shadow of the
mountain into direct sunlight. Below us is a round lake, Itomori Lake. Its calm
surface reflects the morning sun, glittering and glaring as though nobody's
watching. The deep-green mountains form their ranks under white clouds in a
blue sky, and a little girl with pigtails and a red school backpack skips along
for no reason. Then there's me beside her, the dazzling, bare-legged high
school girl. In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as
background music. Ooh, it's just like the opening of a Japanese film... In other
words, we live in the boonies—very Japanese and a few decades behind the
times.
"Miiitsuhaaa!"
After Yotsuha and I part ways in front of the elementary school, a voice
calls out from behind me. It's Tesshi, pedaling his bike and looking cranky,
with Saya seated primly on the bike rack and smiling.
"Hurry up and get off," Tesshi grumbles.
"I'm fine right here. Don't be stingy!"
"C'mon, you're heavy."
"And you're rude!"
This early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a
married couple in a comedy skit.
"You two get along so well."
"We do not!" they chorus.
They deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack
switches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a
good ten years—petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and
tall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look
like they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly
synced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.
"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today."
Saya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,
grinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied
together in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.
"Huh? What about my hair?"
Her comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in
the shuffle at breakfast. I did it "properly" today—does that mean it was weird
yesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking
concerned. "Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?"
"Exorcise?"
"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!"
".. .Excuse me?" I frown at the unexpected remark.
Saya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. "Would you quit blamin'
everythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.
Right?"
Stressed?
"Huh? Wait, hold it—what's all this about?"
Why is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't
remember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.
...Hmm?
Wait, was it really? Yesterday, I...
"—And most importantly!"
A deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.
On the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little
crowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal
parking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and
bolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit
jacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent—Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for
the mayoral election.
"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the
village restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we
be able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I
intend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it
through to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,
creating a local society in which everyone—from our children to our senior
citizens—can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my
resolve to make this vision my goal..."
It's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold—
this campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot
surrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd— "You know it's
gonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, " "It sounds like he s been
spreadin ' lots of cash around" —make my mood even darker.
"Hey, Miyamizu."
"...Mornin'."
Wonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.
Even in high school, they're part of the flashy "in-crowd," and they snark at us
—the "drones"—over every little thing.
"The mayor and the contractor," one of them says, shooting a deliberate
glance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next
to mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an
armband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.
The guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. "Their kids are all
buddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?"
This is so stupid. I don't even answer—I walk faster, trying to get out of
there. Tesshi's expressionless. Only Saya looks bothered and a bit flustered.
"Mitsuha!"
Suddenly, a loud voice booms out. Yeep! My breath catches in my throat. I
don't believe this. My dad lowered his mic midspeech to shout at me without
the aid of electronic amplification. The whole crowd turns to look at me.
"Mitsuha, straighten up!"
I turn beet red. It's so unfair that I almost start crying. I want to run, but I
desperately fight back the urge and stride away instead.
The crowd is whispering. "He's even tough on family."
"That's the mayor for you."
I hear my classmates snickering. "Ooh. Harsh."
"I kinda feel a little sorry for her."

Please don't ask me "Who goes there?" I'm waiting
here for my love, in the September dew.
"Tasokare , 'who goes there?' This is the origin of the term tasogare, or
twilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?"
Speaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big
letters on the blackboard.
"It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,
making it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that
isn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has
another name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had
other names."
Miss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just
shuffling around the same letters.
"'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl "
Somebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of
course, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was
little is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,
our classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school
like this.
"I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori
still use ancient Japanese words here and there."
"'Cause this here's the sticks," proclaims one of the boys, and people start
giggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to
ask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were
abandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly
pondering, I flip through my notebook, and then—on a page that should be
blank—I see something written in big letters:
Who are you?
...Huh?
What is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being
absorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my
notebook to anybody, either. What? "Who am I?" What's that supposed to
mean?
"...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!"
"Oh! Yes'm!" I stand up hastily.
"Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please," Miss Yuki tells me.
Scrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, "Good to see that you
remember your name today, Miss Miyamizu."
At that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is
going on?!
"You don't remember?"
"...No."
"For real?"
"Yes, for real," I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's
looking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.
".. .No, listen. Yesterday, you forgot where your desk and your locker were.
Your hair was all mussed and cowlicky, and you hadn't tied it back. You didn't

looking at the pair of them as they sit on the bench with the sunset-colored lake

Mm-hmm, y'all really do look good together. Tonight, I must perform my awful
duty, but I hope you can enjoy your youth.
"Awww, I wanna do it, too," Yotsuha grumbles.
"It's too soon for you yet, Yotsuha," hushes Gran.
The constant click of spherical weights knocking together echoes in a
workroom big enough for only about eight tatami mats. "Listen to the voice of
the thread," Gran tells her. Even as she speaks, her hands don't pause in their
work. "If you keep windin' threads that way, before long, emotions will start
runnin' between you and the thread."
"Huh? But thread doesn't talk."
"Our braided cords—," Gran continues, ignoring Yotsuha's objection. All
three of us are wearing kimonos, and we're finishing up the cords that we'll
use in tonight's ceremony.
Braided cords are made of thin threads plaited together into a single rope.
It's a traditional folk art that's been handed down for a very long time. The
finished cords are cute and colorful, with all sorts of designs braided into
them. That said, the work takes quite a bit of skill, so Gran's making Yotsuha's
for her. Yotsuha's spending the time doing assistant work, winding thread
around the ball-weights.
"Our braided cords hold a thousand years of Itomori's history. I tell you,
that school of yours really should put priority on teachin' this sort of town
history to you children. Listen, two hundred years ago..."
Here we go again, I think with a wry little smile. It's Gran's favorite
speech, and I've heard it over and over in this workroom, ever since I was
small.
"A fire began in the bathroom of Mayugorou Yamazaki, the straw sandal-
maker, and it burned up this whole area, including the shrine and all the old
records. It was what people call—"
Gran glances at me.
"'The Great Mayugorou Fire,"' I answer smoothly.
Mm-hmm. Gran nods, looking satisfied.
"What? They named the fire after him?!" Yotsuha exclaims, startled. "Poor
Mr. Mayugorou," she mutters. "Havin' his name stick around 'cause of
somethin' like that."
"Thanks to that fire, we don't know what our dances or the patterns in our
cords mean anymore. All we have left are the forms. Still, even not knowin',
we mustn't ever let the forms disappear. The meanin' in those shapes is bound
to resurface someday."
Gran's words have a unique rhythm to them, like a traditional ballad, and as
I braid my cord, I mouth the words along with her, silently reciting them from
memory. The meanin ' in those shapes is bound to resurface someday. Here,
at Miyamizu Shrine —
"Here, at Miyamizu Shrine, that's our solemn duty. And yet..."
At that point, Gran lowers her mild eyes, sadly.
"And yet, that foolish son of mine... As if abandonin' the priesthood and
leavin' this house weren't enough, he had to become a politician..."
Gran sighs, and I sneak a small sigh of my own underneath it. Even I don't
really know whether I love this town or hate it, whether I want to go
somewhere far away or stay with my family and friends forever. When I

I'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's
more embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The
part that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.
Oh, for the love of—
I don't wanna!
Plagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the
dance ends. Agh. Here it comes.
Munch, munch, munch.
Munch.
Munch, munch, munch, munch.
I'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to
think, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing
the exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small
wooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,
a diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.
Munch, munch, munch.
Munch, munch.
Agh, I swear...
Munch, munch, munch.
I'm going to have to do it soon.
Munch, munch.
Arrrgh.
Munch.
Giving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,
attempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.
And then. Aaagh.
Puckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The
mixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I
feel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.
Please, nobody look at me.
Mouth-brewed sake.
It's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with
saliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to
the gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I
don't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first
century... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!
I mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice
and put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the
exact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over
and over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.
Inside, I'm crying my eyes out.
Abruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a
faint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.
Curses.
I want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy
"in-crowd" classmates. They're watching me with smirks on their faces and
gleefully gossiping about something. There's too much distance between us for
me to really hear them but I feel as though I'm hearing them loud and clear.
Eeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how
can she do that in public? Nobody's ever gonna marry her now.
I make a very, very firm resolution:
When I graduate, I am leaving this town and going far away.`,length:3786,num_lines:65,location:"Miyamizu Shrine",importance:.8,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Yotsuha",role:"Supporting character, performing the ritual alongside the unnamed shrine maiden",importance:.7,emotion:"Calm and composed",sentiment:.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Yotsuha remains calm and focused while performing the ritual, contrasting with the unnamed shrine maiden's distress.",importance_rank:1},{name:"Tesshi",role:"Classmate observing the ritual, contributing to the protagonist's embarrassment",importance:.5,emotion:"Amused and judgmental",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Tesshi's presence and smirking demeanor add to the protagonist's feelings of humiliation.",importance_rank:2},{name:"Saya",role:"Classmate observing the ritual, contributing to the protagonist's embarrassment",importance:.5,emotion:"Amused and judgmental",sentiment:-.5,quote:"No quote available",fake_quote:"Saya's presence and laughter amplify the protagonist's embarrassment during the ritual.",importance_rank:3}],number:6,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:2},{title:"Sisterly Support",summary:"Taki and Yotsuha discuss their future and the town's limitations.",chapter:"Chapter Two The Beginning",first_line:519,last_line:583,text:`"Cheer up, Sis. Who cares if people from your school saw you? And
anyway, what's got you so shook up?"
"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!"
I glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office
entrance.
After the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a
banquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was
the hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.
"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a
sweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. "
"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead—drink some
more!"
We entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally
turned us loose just now, saying, "You kids can go on home." Gran and the
other adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.
"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?"
On the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool
sounds of insect songs echo all around us.
"I dunno. Sixty?"
"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!"
"Huh."
"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.
They're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the
whole place!"
"Hmm..."
What I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but
Yotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,
she's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving
up, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,
shining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.
"...That's it!"
As we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha
suddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a
cake someone hid from her.
"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay
your way to Tokyo?!"
For a moment, I'm speechless.
".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that."
"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and
call it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!"
Should I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?
Still, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she
really is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll
give this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell
sake on your own like that?
"Well? What do you think, Sis?"
"Hmm..."
.. .And that's all I have to say.
".. .Wait, no! It'd be against the liquor laws!"
Wait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,
I've broken into a run. All sorts of incidents and feelings and prospects and
doubts and despairs are jumbled together inside me, and it feels like my heart's
about to explode. I run down the steps, taking them two at a time, slam on the
brakes under the torii gate on the landing, and suck in a huge lungful of chilly
night air. Then I expel the cluttered mess in my chest along with it.
"I'm sick of this town! I'm sick of this life! Make me a hot guy in Tokyo in
my next life, puhleeeease!"
Eeease. Eeease. Eeease. Eeease...
My wish echoes around the dark mountains, then disappears as though
drawn into Itomori Lake below me. The words came out on impulse, and
they're so dumb, my head cools right down, as does my sweat.
Oh, but even so.

I apologize out of habit.

Just as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the
head.
"That's senpai to you!" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He
goes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got
seniority on me. Okay!
"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really..."
"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?"
As she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes
curve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of
beauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel
compelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look
down.
"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just..."
"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let
him have his food for free, but..."
She doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping
down another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...
"Eek! Okudera-senpai!"
Another waitress cries out.
"Your skirt!"
"Hmm?"
Miss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now
that I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a
shocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.
"Are you hurt?"
"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?"
"I think something like that's happened before..."
"Was someone harassing you?"
"Do you remember the guy's face?"
Several staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.
Eyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the
words I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I
see little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.
This time, I need to rescue her.
The thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,
I've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my
back ("Hey! Taki, you little..."), but I ignore them.
The green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at
least one more design element. The brown is— Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The
cream is for its nose.
Pinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For
some reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing
room sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate
repair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly
good at.
"All done!"
I hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to
finish.
"...Huh? This is..."
The dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing
room quickly shifts to surprise.
"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!"
The tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so
as I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.
The skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought
being a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like
Okudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but
when she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the
neighborhood.
"You really saved me today. Thank you very much."
I finally managed to say it.
"Heh-heh!" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.
"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but
you're always so quick to fight."
As she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I
grasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.
"I like this version of you better," Okudera-senpai says, a bit
mischievously. "You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki."

By now, I've realized that Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.
Convenience stores, family restaurants, the people I pass, the edge of the park,
construction sites, the station at night, the inside of the train... Almost every ten
steps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced
smells when gathered in one place.
And for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person
living in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that
stretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the
overwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.
Taki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand
toward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but
I guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,
as if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know
"Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself."
Back at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this
morning.
I'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1
had! Isn't that amazin '? Aren't you awed by my fantastic imagination?! It s
like I actually went to Tokyo! I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist—or no, wait,
I'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll
probably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?
Fantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick
up Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my
fingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary

For some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.

oddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the

thrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored
shower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to

I say the words aloud, despite myself. I'm staring at my hand.
Finally, I let my eyes drop from the letters on my palm down to my
wrinkled uniform and necktie... So, what—I fell asleep without changing?
"—Wh.. .wh-what is this?!"
This time, I actually yell. We're having breakfast, and my dad glances at me
but promptly loses interest and returns his attention to his bowl. I stare at my
phone, stunned. There's a really long journal entry on it that I don't remember
writing.
...And on the way home from work, Okudera-
senpai and I walked to the station together, just
the two of us! It's all because I'm in touch with
my feminine side.
"Taki, want to hit another cafe today?"
"Uh, sorry, I've got work after this."
"Ha-ha. You know where to go?"
"Huh? .. .Hey! Tsukasa, you jerk, was that you?"
I raise my voice without meaning to. Actually, I wish it was him. Tsukasa's
puzzled expression tells me it wasn't, though. Even I know there's no reason
somebody'd go to all that trouble for a prank.
Getting up from my chair, I reluctantly excuse myself:
".. .Nah, never mind. See ya."
As I leave the classroom, I hear Takagi's voice behind me. Dude's back to
normal today.

The minute I do, all my classmates' eyes are on me. Eep! I give a little

"Miyamizuwas really cool yesterday, huh."
"Uh-huh. I didn't think she had it in her."

Saya peers into my face, looking puzzled and worried.
—You know.. .durin' art yesterday, when we were sketchin' that still life.
Huh? You really don't remember? Again? Honestly, Mitsuha, are you okay?
You and me were in the same group. We were supposed to be drawin' the vase
and the apples—y'know, the subject that doesn't make any sense. Except you
sketched a landscape instead. Well, that bit doesn't matter. Anyway,
Matsumoto's group was behind us, and they were talkin' nasty, the way they
always do.
What, you want to know? Um, well, about the mayoral election.
Huh? Details? Oh, you know, how the town administration is all just
figurin' out how to hand out subsidies, and it's the same no matter who does it,
but how there are "some kids" whose livelihood depends on it, et cetera.
Dumb stuff like that. When you heard them, you said, "That's me they're talkin'
about, right?" So I said I thought it probably was. I mean, if you ask me, I'm
gonna answer, right? Then, Mitsuha, what do you suppose you did?
You seriously don't remember? You kicked the desk with the vase on it
right toward Matsumoto's group! And with a great big grin on your face!
Matsumoto and the others got scared, and of course, the vase broke, and the

Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?"
Yotsuha whines.
Gran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.
"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either."
Mayugorou?
".. .Who's that?" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.
"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous."
Famous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.
The three Miyamizu women—me, the grandma, and Yotsuha—have been
hiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're
taking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.
These people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.
The sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.
The air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the
pleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in
this town now.
Come to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.
The thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this
mountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong
walker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've
never lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what
kind of shape she's in.
"Hey, Grandma!"
I break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this
little old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really
good lunches.
"Let me piggyback you. If you want..."
"Oh, may I?" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto
my back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at
somebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,
warm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs
nothing.
"Grandma, you're way light— Whoa!"
The moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.
Yotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, "Come on, Sis!" Come to think of it,
Mitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the
world this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.
"Mitsuha, Yotsuha."
I hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.
"Are you familiar with musubiT '
" MusubiT '
Yotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to
her stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole
round lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from
climbing with her grandma on her back.
"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of
spirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's."
Guardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old
lady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and
it's oddly persuasive.
"Did you know?" she starts again. "Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'
people is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the
same word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the
braided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself."
I can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I
think.
"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'
undone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's
musubi ."
Without really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up
against rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a
whole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,
but I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I
wake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,
falling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry
mountain.
"Here, drink up."
We take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.
It's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,
and I drain two cups in a row. "C'mon! Me too!" Yotsuha pesters. This may be
the best drink I've ever had.
"That's another musubi."
"Huh?"
As I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.
She's sitting at the base of a tree.
"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
called musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your
soul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition

family has observed for centuries."`,length:4639,num_lines:80,location:"Mountain",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Yotsuha",role:"Curious and inquisitive about the shrine's god",importance:.6,emotion:"Curious and slightly confused",sentiment:.2,quote:"Huh?

Fortunately, the place where we're meeting is nearby. I sprint flat out and
arrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to
make sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend
morning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.
I wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter "Mitsuha,
you idiot" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.
...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,
this is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,

Three hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever
been in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope
that's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation
unprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too
pretty.
I mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.
Then they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're
thinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,
anyway.
Well, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I
want to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.
Consequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can
tell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely
uncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.
Dammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!
Hoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.
...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.
And so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked
links, just for you!
"Whoa, seriously?!"
Look at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them
for dear life.

.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.
Walking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.
I'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled
Nostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-
senpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.
Furano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is
divided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't
know the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can
make out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's
summer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem
oddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you
go. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. "Shibuya
and Ikebukuro," for example, or "Akasaka and Kichijouji," or "Meguro and
Tachikawa."
Even so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.
This one is different from the others.
Well, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place—the contours
of the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red
shrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick
out your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I
never actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations
when I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful
sense of deja vu about the place. This is—
"Taki?"
When I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a
second, I forgot she existed.
"You know, Taki," she says with an even smile, "you seem like a different
person today."
She executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me
behind.
I blew it.
All I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole
thing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even
consider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.
Even though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I
should've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've
spent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.
From the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi
buildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.
My eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.
Her hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,
she might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat
tighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I
grope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.
"Um, Okudera-senpai?"
She doesn't turn.
".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere—"
"Why don't we call it a day instead?" she suggests with the tone of a patient
teacher.
"Okay."
On the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-
senpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun
—I can't see it clearly.

I gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of
summer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,
and after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on
a real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's
disappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it
the entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.
It feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of
anything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming
Mitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,
we're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound
together the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think
I'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.
"That's why you're not popular, you know. " "It's your fault for promising
stuff without checking first. "
I open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.
The comet should be visible just about the time
the date ends.
Eeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.
V
Whether it's me or you, let's do our best on the
date!
Comet?
I look up at the sky. The last traces of the sunset are already gone. A few of
the brightest stars are out, and a jet's flying past, humming faintly, but that's it.
Needless to say, there's no comet.
"What's she talking about?" I mutter quietly.
If a comet people could actually see was passing, it would've been pretty
big news. Maybe Mitsuha got mixed up.
Abruptly, my heart twinges uneasily in its darkest recesses.
Something's trying to surface in my mind.
I flip through the phone and pull up Mitsuha's cell number, staring at those
eleven digits. Back when we first started swapping, I tried calling this number
several times, but for some reason, it never went through. I touch it with a
fingertip. The "calling" sound plays. Then I hear a voice from the speaker:
"The number you have dialed is unavailable. Either the number is not in
service or the unit is turned off or out of range... "
I pull the phone away from my ear and press end call.
So calls really don't get through. Well, whatever. I'll just tell her about this
train wreck of a day next time we swap. I'll ask her about the comet, too. We'll
switch tomorrow or the day after, anyway. With that thought, I finally descend
the pedestrian bridge. There's a pale, smooth half-moon overhead, all alone, as
if someone forgot it there.`,length:2650,num_lines:43,location:"Pedestrian Bridge",importance:.8,conflict:.3,characters:[{name:"Mitsuha Miyamizu",role:"Inspiration for the protagonist's thoughts and feelings",importance:.8,emotion:"Hopeful and romantic",sentiment:.5,quote:`"That's why you're not popular, you know."`,fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1}],number:15,importance_rank:11,conflict_rank:10},{title:"The Search Begins",summary:"Taki reflects on his daily life and drawing.",chapter:"Chapter Four The Search",first_line:3,last_line:26,text:`I move my pencil tirelessly.

Every morning, I take the train to school during the commuter rush. I sit
through boring classes. I eat lunch with Tsukasa and Takagi. I walk through
town, looking up at the sky. Somewhere along the way, its blue has grown a
little deeper. Bit by bit, the trees lining the streets begin to change color.
In my room at night, I draw. On my desk, there's a stack of mountain
guidebooks I borrowed from the library. I search the ranges of Hida on my
smartphone. I look for ridgelines that match the ones I remember. I keep my
pencil in motion, trying to copy them down onto paper somehow.

billowing clouds reminiscent of sheep. Some days, strong winds blow,

"Approaching Nagoya ," a lazy voice announces over the train's
loudspeaker.
The exchanges with Mitsuha started out of the blue one day and ended just
as suddenly. No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn't figure out why.
After several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have
been a string of extremely vivid dreams.
I've got proof, though. I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on
my phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could
never have happened if I'd been myself. I'm convinced Mitsuha's a real girl.
Her body heat, her pulse, the way she breathes, her voice, the red light
dawning over her closed eyes, the vibrant sounds in her ears—I felt all of that
myself. Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't
alive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.
Because of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.
Something might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.
Maybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I'm overthinking things, at the
very least, she's bound to be worried about the situation, too. That's why I
decided to go see her in person. But...
. .Excuse me? You don't actually know where she is?"
We're in a four-person box seat on the express train Hida. Okudera-senpai
sounds incredulous, stuffing her face with a box lunch she picked up at the
station.
"...Right."
"Your only clue is what the town looks like? You can't even contact this
girl? Are you kidding me?!"
I didn't ask her to come with me. How come I'm getting blamed? I look at
Tsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso
cutlet.
"You are an abysmal tour planner."
"This isn't a tour!"
I lose it for a second. These two think they're on some kind of field trip. I
can read their expressions clearly. There's just no help for this child. Why are
they acting all superior, anyway?
"Well, never mind," Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,
throwing out her chest. "Don't you worry, Taki. We'll help you look."
"Eeeee, it's so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!"
At the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes
over the area's laid-back mascot. It's a full-body plush cow costume wearing a
station employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click
in the little terminal.
"You guys are in the way."
As I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced
that these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her
myself.
The plan goes like this:
Since I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to
a spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll
have to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing
the drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working
our way north along the local line. There's a railroad crossing in one of the
scenes I remember, so following the tracks should work.
It's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a
"plan" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that
many towns built around lakes. I'm convinced I'll probably find some kind of
hint by tonight, though I've got no grounds for thinking that.

"One Takayama ramen here."
"Uh, okay, then I'll have the same, too."
"You betcha. Three ramen!" says the middle-aged lady cheerily.
On our fruitless way to the next (abnormally distant) station, we found a
ramen shop that was miraculously open and made a beeline inside. When the
lady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, "C'mon in," her smile seemed a
beacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're
lost.
The ramen's good, too. Contrary to its name, it's perfectly ordinary ramen
(I thought it might have Hi da beef on top, but it was regular braised pork), but
as soon as I eat the noodles and veggies, I can feel my body recharging. After
draining the soup bowl dry and drinking two cups of water, I finally take a
breather.
"Do you think we'll be able to get back to Tokyo today?" I ask Tsukasa.
"Hmm... I don't know. We may be cutting it close. Want me to check?"
Tsukasa apparently didn't expect this but nevertheless pulls out his phone
and starts looking up how to get home.
"Thanks," I tell him.
"Taki, you're sure that's all right?" Okudera-senpai asks.
She's across the table from me and hasn't finished eating yet. I'm not
immediately sure how to answer, so I look out the window. The sun's just
barely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields
along the prefectural highway.
"I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track," I
mutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my
strategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town
with sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how
it starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely
ordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered
around a round lake. Even though it felt so solid to me when I finished drawing
it, it looks like an anonymous, mediocre landscape now.

with a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach
to Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put
Halley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4
billion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly
seventy-five thousand miles of Earth—closer than the moon. The tail of this
shining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first
time in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it
welcomed Comet Tiamat.
Until the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's
nucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in
diameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,
plummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per
second. Tragically, it struck Japan—a residential area called Itomori.
The town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision
occurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which
must have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.
The meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The
destruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge
hole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,
magnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds
later, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater
part of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the
town's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in
human history.
Since the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,
ultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.
Damage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the
thousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In
less than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.
Fourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori
was gone.
—These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.
Three years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet
Tiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.
.. .But that's weird.
It doesn't make sense.
I lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.
That means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.

other.

single book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:

run my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on

Natori, Sayaka (17)

I've finally reached the peak.
"...It's there!"
Sure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant
sacred tree.
"It's really there! It wasn't a dream!"
The rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I
scrub roughly at my face with my sleeve, then start down the slope into the
caldera.
In front of me, what was a little stream in my memories is now a decent-
size pond. Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that
dream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several
dozen yards away on the other side.
This is the edge of the next world.
I remember somebody saying that to me once.
Does that make this the Sanzu River?
I step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot
into a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The
heavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing
sound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with
muddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm
not welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,
into the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get
across somehow.
The massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.
I don't know whether the "body of the god" is the tree, the rock, or whether
the shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's
a little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go
down it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.
The silence here is even deeper than it was outside.
I unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to
make sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single
movement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems
completely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.
This place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.
The tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,
two four-inch urns sit side by side.
"It's the sake we carried up here."
Gently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold
anymore.
"This is her little sister's..."
My hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick
it up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put
down roots.
"And this is the one I brought."
I sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on
it. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It
must have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this
time into words.
. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?"
I untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.
"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died
three years ago when the meteorite fell?"
I pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the
lid.
"Half of her..."
I bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles
floating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.
" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then
reuniting..."
I raise the lidful of sake to my lips.
"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time..."
Take me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound
is so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it
hits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.
But nothing happens.

uses anymore and put together an evacuation plan for the town.
The goal is to get all 188 families—about five hundred people—out of the
danger zone before the meteorite falls. The first thing we think of is
broadcasting an evacuation order.
After we run through the inevitable ridiculous ideas— We'll take over the
prime minister's official residence! Or the Diet Building! Or the NHK
Shibuya Broadcasting Center, or at least the NHK Gifu-Takayama branch
office! —we start talking about how not everybody in town will be at home
with their TVs or radios on and how even more people will be out and about
because of the autumn festival tonight. Then we fall silent, thinking.
".. .The disaster alert system!" Teshigawara shouts suddenly.
"Disaster alert system?"
"Hunh? Don't go tellin' me you don't know. There are speakers all over
town, remember?"
"Oh... That thing that starts talking out of the blue every morning and
evening? Who was born, who's having a funeral, that sort of thing?"
"Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you're inside or
out. If we send the order over that...!"
"Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn't it? Would
they let us broadcast stuff if we asked?"
"Pssh. No."
"Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we'd have a
better shot at that than at taking over NHK, but..."
"Heh-heh-heh." With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his
phone. Geez, this guy looks happy.
"We can do this!"
He holds out his phone to me.
Superimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.
"Wha...? Is this for real?"
Teshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.
"Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?"
"Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y'know? About destroyin' the
town, overthrowin' the school, stuff like that. Doesn't everybody?"
"Huh...?" That weirds me out a bit. But, no—this is...
"This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!"
Without thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara's shoulders.
"H-hey, don't get too close!"
"Huh?"
Whoa. Even his ears are red.
"What's this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?"
I look up into Teshigawara's face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,
Mitsuha, you're not to be taken lightly, are you? C'mon, c'mon! I press my
body against him some more. Here you go—have a freebie! We're sitting side
by side on an old sofa, and Tesshi's already right by the wall, so he's got
nowhere to run.
"Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!"
Teshigawara resists, big body squirming. He's a guy, for sure... Well, so
am I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,
and yells, "I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age—that ain't proper!"
"Ha..."
Even his buzzed scalp is red. He's sweating bullets, and his eyes look
almost teary.
"Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you're such a...!"
In spite of myself, I crack up laughing.
He's a really good guy, and I'm positive I can count on him.
I thought of him as a friend before, but I'd like to meet him and the others
for real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and
Saya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it'd
be a blast.
"Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me..." I'm biting back
laughter, and Teshigawara's sulking. "Will you help me think up the rest of the
evacuation plan?"
I smile at him Tesshi's face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.
Once this is over, I'll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit
dazzled.
"A-a-a...a bomb?!"
Saya yells. She's eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.
"Technically, they're called water-gel explosives. They're kinda like
dynamite," Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He's crunching away on
potato chips, and I'm noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of
convenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like
we're having a party.
Teshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully
engineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic
music to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged—something
that sounds like a strategy meeting.
Taking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.
"There's lots of explosives in my dad's company's warehouse, for construction
stuff. If I don't have to worry about gettin' caught afterward, I can snatch as
much as we need."
"Then, next," I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I'm really hungry, and
for some reason, everything I eat when I'm in Mitsuha's body tastes really
good.
"Y-y-y.. .you're gonna hijack the signal?!" Saya's voice cracks.
Munching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. "Rural wireless disaster
alert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the
transmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The
speakers are made so they'll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered
over the audio."
Melon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. "That means we can
send the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room."
I point at the map of Itomori. There's a circle with a diameter of a little less
than a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.
"This is the area that's supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you
can see, Itomori High is outside it." I tap on the location of the high school.
"In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard."
"B-but that's..." Saya begins stammering nervously. "That's a full-blown
crime!"
Even as she says it, she's putting the strawberry—which she saved for last
—in her mouth.
"We'll never get the people around here to move without committing a
crime," I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I'd scattered over
the map. That's right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it
doesn't matter whether it's a crime or not.
"Y'know, Mitsuha, it's like you're a different person."
I grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I'm in this body, I
unconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I've completely abandoned
trying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when
everything's over, nothing else matters. As long as we're all alive, things will
work out.
"...So. You're the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya," I tell her
cheerfully.
"Why?!"
"Well, you're in the broadcasting club, right?"
"Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell
you the wireless frequency," says Teshigawara.
"Huh? I can't just..."
Ignoring Saya's protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. "I'm the
explosives guy!"
"And I'm going to go talk to the mayor," I say, pointing to myself.
"Huh?!" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.
"We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just
talked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don't come out at the end,
there's no way we'll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to

Out of nowhere, he explodes. The creases between his eyes grow deeper.

talking to himself. He fixes me with a piercing look and speaks in a low tone.
"Listen, Mitsuha. If you're being serious with me, then you are ill."

As I climb the narrow stone steps, the evening sun lances straight into my
eyes.

She went to a big terminal station, where the Shinkansen to Tokyo stopped.
The local train she took to get there was empty, despite the fact that it was rush
hour, when students were heading to school. Since there were no schools along
the track, everyone who commuted around here drove.
'Tmgoin' into Tokyo for a bit."
This had been Mitsuha's abrupt announcement to her little sister when they
left the house that morning.
"Huh? Now? Why?!" Yotsuha asks, startled.
"Um... For a date?"
"Wha—?! Sis, you have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!"
"Uh, well... It's not my date." Unsure how to explain herself, Mitsuha
breaks into a run. "I'll be back tonight. Don't worry!"
Gazing at the scenery flying past the window of the bullet train, Mitsuha
wonders:
Why am I crashin ' Okudera-senpai and Takis date? It's not like the three
of us can just hang out together. Besides, I've never been to Tokyo before.
Will I even be able to find Taki? Even if I do, will it bother him that I'm
showin' up out of the blue? Will he be surprised? Maybe he 'll be upset...
With an uncomplicated ease almost inviting disappointment, the Shinkansen
slides into Tokyo. The incredible crowds leave Mitsuha breathless, but she
tries calling my cell. "...Because the unit is out of range or turned off, the
number you are trying to reach is... " She hangs up. Just like the other calls, it
didn't go through.
I'll never find him, Mitsuha thinks.
Still, after staring at the station information board like it's a quiz, she heads
into the city, relying on her vague memories.
But if I do see him...
She rides the Yamanote Line, the city bus, walks, takes another train, then
walks some more.
What 'll I do? It probably will bother him, right? Maybe it 'll be awkward.
Or maybe —
She sees the words Comet Tiamat at Closest Point Tomorrow on a big
outdoor TV screen.
Or, if I do find him, just maybe, will he—?
Tired from walking, she gazes at the sparkling lights of the buildings from a
pedestrian bridge and thinks, almost praying:
If I find Taki, maybe he 'll be just a little bit happy...
She starts walking again, still thinking.
I'll never find him searchin ' randomly like this. I won't, but I know one
thing for sure. If we meet, we 'll know right away. "You 're the one who was in
me. I'm the one who was in you. "
Mitsuha's certain of this, as if it's as simple as two plus two.
The evening sun sinks through the gap between the station platform roofs, as
weak as a dying flashlight.
Mitsuha's feet are sore from all the walking she's done, and she plants
herself on a bench with her legs kicked out in front of her. She stares absently
at the setting sun, which is much paler and less reliable than in Itomori.
A musical chime plays, and a voice announces: "The local train to...
Chiba...is arriving on... Track Four. " A yellow train glides onto the platform.
The cars kick up a warm wind that ruffles her hair. Mitsuha gazes at the train
windows without really seeing them.
Abruptly, her breath catches.
She jumps to her feet as if she's been stung.
He 'd been there, in the window that had just passed in front of her.
Mitsuha breaks into a sprint. The cars have stopped, and she catches up to
the window almost immediately. The evening train is crowded, though, and she
can't find him again from outside. With a sound like a giant exhalation, the
doors open. The car's so tightly packed that the people are practically spilling
out, making Mitsuha shiver. Even so—murmuring "Excuse me" and sweating
behind the knees—she pushes her way into the crowd. With another giant sigh,
the doors close. The train begins moving. Repeating "Excuse me" over and
over, little by little, Mitsuha works her way forward. Then, in front of one boy,
she stops. The sounds around her vanish.
It's me. The middle school "me" from three years ago.
+ + +
I can't go any higher on the bike.
No sooner have I had the thought than the front wheel catches on a root, and
I slip.
On reflex, I grab the trunk of a nearby tree. The bike slips out from under
me and tumbles down the slope, hitting the ground about ten feet below with a
huge racket. The wheels are bent all out of shape. "Sorry, Teshigawara," I
mutter softly, and I take off running up the narrow mountain track.
Why did I forget? Why didn't I remember until just now?
As I run, I stare at the memories welling up inside me.
Mitsuha, that day, three years ago, you came to see me—
+ +
Taki. Taki, Taki.
For a while now, Mitsuha has been silently rolling my name around on her
tongue. I haven't noticed her at all, even though I'm right in front of her. She
keeps fretting over what tone she should use to address me and what
expression she should wear, so earnestly she seems liable to burst into tears.
Then, forcing a bright smile, she says:
"Taki."
The middle school me is startled hearing my name out of the blue, and I
glance up. We're still about the same height, so her big, vaguely teary eyes are
right in front of me.
"Huh...?"
"Um, do you..."
Smiling desperately, Mitsuha points to herself. I'm bewildered.
"...Huh?"
"Don't you remember me?" asks this stranger, timidly, looking at me
through her lashes.
"Who're you?"
Mitsuha gives a small, breathy shriek, then quickly turns red. She lowers
her eyes, speaking in a voice that's barely audible.
"Oh... I'm sorry..."
The train sways. The passengers all adjust to keep their balance, except for
Mitsuha, who staggers into me. Her hair brushes the tip of my nose, and I catch
the faint scent of shampoo. "I'm sorry," she mumbles again.
Weird girl , thinks middle school me.
Mitsuha's muddled mind races desperately. But you're Taki, so why...? For
both of us, time passes awkwardly.
"The next station is ...Yotsuya. " The announcement offers Mitsuha a bit of
relief. At the same time, though, she feels unbearably sad. Still, she can't stay
here any longer. The doors open, and she moves with the rest of the crowd to
exit the train.
Watching her receding back, I suddenly think, Maybe this weird girl is
somebody I should know. This inexplicable, intense impulse drives me to call
out.
"'Scuse me! What's your name?"
Mitsuha turns back, but the waves of disembarking passengers push her
farther away. Hurriedly, she undoes the braided cord tying back her hair. She
holds it out to me and shouts:
"Mitsuha!"
Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray of evening
sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that color tight.
"My name is Mitsuha!"
^ +
That day, three years ago, you came to see me.
Finally, I know.
A girl I didn't recognize spoke to me on the train once. To me, that was all
it'd been, and I completely forgot about it. But Mitsuha had come to Tokyo
carrying the weight of all those feelings, had been hurt badly, gone back to her
own town, and cut her hair.`,length:6851,num_lines:125,location:"Station",importance:.9,conflict:.7,characters:[{name:"Mitsuha Miyamizu",role:"Determined to find Taki despite uncertainty",importance:1,emotion:"Anxious yet hopeful",sentiment:.5,quote:"If I find Taki, maybe he 'll be just a little bit happy...",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Yotsuha",role:"Curious and surprised about Mitsuha's plans",importance:.5,emotion:"Startled and inquisitive",sentiment:.2,quote:"Huh?

That lame expression strikes me as funny and lovable. The emotion is
stronger than my surprise, and, slowly, I start to smile.

When I call to her, Mitsuha's eyes rapidly fill with tears.
".. .Taki? Taki? Taki? Taki?"
As she repeats herself like an idiot, her hands find my arms. Her fingers
tighten, squeezing.
"Taki, you're here for real!"
Her voice sounds hoarse and tight. Big tears roll down her cheeks.
We've finally met. Really met. We're facing each other, Mitsuha as
Mitsuha, me as myself, in our own bodies. I feel deeply relieved. A sense of
profound peace wells up inside me, as if, after being abroad for a long time in
a country where I didn't know the language, I've finally come home. A calm
joy fills me.
Mitsuha just keeps sobbing.

"It's here..."
Mitsuha looks up at the sky, and as she whispers, her voice trembles
slightly. I follow her gaze. In the western sky, which is turning a deep, dark
blue, the shape of long-tailed Comet Tiamat is faintly visible.
"It's all right. You'll make it." I say this definitively, as much to convince
myself as anything.

in the world you are, I'll find you again. I swear."
Up in the sky, the comet's nowhere to be seen, and a few stars are beginning
to twinkle.
"Your name is Mitsuha."
I close my eyes, making sure of my memories, turning them into something I
can count on.
"It's okay. I remember!"
Confidence deepening, I open my eyes again. There's a white half-moon in
the distant horizon.
"Mitsuha, Mitsuha... Mitsuha, Misua, Misua. Your name is Misua!"
I'm yelling her name at the half-moon.
"Your name is...!"
Abruptly, the outline of the word I meant to utter blurs.
I quickly snatch up the pen and write the first letter of her name on my
palm... Or I try to.

After a single line, my hand stops. The tip of the pen starts to tremble. I
want to make it stop shaking and grip it tight. I try stabbing it in like a needle,
to carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an
inch. My lips move.
"...Who are you?"
The pen falls from my hand.
They're vanishing. Your name. Your memories.
"Why did I come here?"
I want to tether them to me somehow, to scrape the fragments of memory
together, so I say them aloud.
"Her... I came to see her! I came to save her! I wanted her to live!"
It's disappearing. Something so precious to me is disappearing.
"Who are you? Who are you, who are you, who are you...?"
Slipping away. Even the emotions I know I felt are leaving me.
"Somebody important, somebody I can't forget, somebody I didn't want to
forget!"
Everything's vanishing, sorrow and love alike. I don't even know why I'm
crying now. My emotions are disintegrating, crumbling like a sand castle.
"Who are you, who are you, who...?"
After the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it's
loneliness. In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all
that stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced
me to take.
Fine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is
loneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I
have, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet
again, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting
resolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll
forget even the fact that I've forgotten something.
And so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky
one last time:

Tesshi practically rips opens his sports bag. It's stuffed with tubes that look

prefectural road. We're heading for an area between the slopes of the
mountains, where the lights are concentrated: Miyamizu Shrine, the site of the
autumn festival. Out of nowhere, I feel an odd nostalgia, as if I've come back
home after a long time away.
"Mitsuha, she wants to talk to you."
"Hello? Saya?!" I put the smartphone to my own ear.
"Waaaaaah, Mitsuhaaaa!" Saya sounds like she's in tears. "C'mon, do I
really have to do this?!"
Her anxious voice sends a pang through my heart. If I were in her shoes, I'd
probably be crying, too. Even sneaking by yourself into the broadcasting room
at night is something you'd do only for a friend.
"Saya, I'm sorry, but Embeggin' you! Please!" At this point, that's all I can
say. "I'll never ask you for anythin' else as long as I live, but if we don't do
this, a lot of people are gonna die! Once you start the announcement, repeat it
for as long as you can!"
There's no response. All I can hear from the receiver are little muffled
sniffling noises.
"Saya? Saya!"
I start getting nervous.
Abruptly, I hear a tiny voice. "Okay! Agh, I don't even care anymore! You
tell Tesshi he better buy me somethin', too!"
"What'd she say?"
Putting the smartphone in my skirt pocket, I yell back loud enough to be
heard over the moped's engine. "That you better buy her somethin', too!"
"Awright, let's do this!"
Tesshi shouts determinedly, as if trying to suppress something, and just then,
behind us, there's a bang like a big firework bursting.
We stop the moped and look back. Two, three. One more. The explosions
echo one after another, and hallway up the mountain—where we were just a
few minutes ago—thick black smoke is rising. In slow motion, an enormous
transmission tower begins tilting.
"Tesshi...!"
My voice quavers.
"Ha-ha!"
Tesshi's breath is shaky, too. It sounds like a laugh.
There's an even bigger explosion, and the lights of the town instantly go
dark.
"Hey," Tesshi intones, sounding kind of dazed.
"The power's out," I say, stating the obvious.
It worked. We did it.
Suddenly, sirens well up, beginning to wail.
000OOOOOOOO000000...!
The earsplitting noise reverberates from speakers all over town. It's an
ominous sound, like a giant's scream, and it ricochets off the mountains,
pervading the area.
It's Saya. She's hijacked the wireless disaster prevention system
We exchange wordless nods, then straddle the moped again. As we race
toward the shrine, the speakers broadcasting Saya's voice spur us on. Slowly,
calmly, as if her earlier tearful cries were fake, she delivers the message we
came up with:
"This is Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at Itomori Substation.
There is a danger of further explosions and forest fires."
Tesshi's moped goes off the prefectural road and climbs up a narrow
mountain track. It's the gentler slope up to the shrine—this way, we can take
the moped all the way to the back of the main building and avoid the stone
stairs on the shrine approach. The seat shakes violently, and I cling to Tesshi's
back as I listen to Saya's voice booming through the town. She sounds exactly
like her big sister. Nobody would suspect this isn't a broadcast from the town
hall.`,length:3386,num_lines:62,location:"Miyamizu Shrine",importance:.9,conflict:.8,characters:[{name:"Mitsuha Miyamizu",role:"Desperately urging Saya to help",importance:1,emotion:"Anxious and determined",sentiment:.5,quote:"Saya, I'm sorry, but Embeggin' you!

we take off our helmets and throw them away.

When we hit the bottom of the stairs, we're behind the main shrine building.
The silhouettes of the people gathered for the festival are just ahead, and I hear
an uneasy murmur. Tesshi and I dash into their midst as if we're racing each
other, yelling.
"Ruuun! A forest fire's cornin'! This place ain't safe!"
Tesshi's voice is unbelievably loud, like he's using a megaphone. I shout,

emerge in the very center of the grounds.
"Yeah, they said there really is a forest fire!"

easy by the stalls or standing, idly talking. They're even smoking cigarettes or
drinking, chatting away and enjoying the evening.

away... Him?
"Hey. Mitsuha? What's up?"
"...Tesshi, listen, what'll I do?"
My mind isn't working, and before I know it, I'm pleading to Tesshi.
"His name... I can't remember his name!"
Tesshi's face twists with worry. Suddenly, he yells at me. "Who the hell
cares, you idiot?! Look around! You started all this!"
He's glaring at me, furious. Belatedly, I notice that Saya's call to "Please
evacuate to Itomori High School" is now erratic, as if she's about to burst
into tears.
"Mitsuha, go !" Tesshi gives a heartrending yell, practically begging this
time. "Go talk your dad around!"
My spine straightens as though he's slapped me across the face.

I nod as firmly as I can, then bolt into a sprint, trying to shake myself free.
Behind me, I hear Tesshi scream again. "I said run, y'all! Get to the high
school!"
Saya's voice echoes all over town. "There is a danger of forest fires.

trembling as well.

The faces of the four interviewers in front of me cloud slightly. No, no,
that's just my imagination , I think. This is the first time I've managed to make
it to the second round of interviews at a company. I can't blow this chance , I
think, psyching myself up again.
"I always have. Even I don't really understand why, but, um... Anyway, I
like them. What I mean is, I like watching buildings and the people who live
and work there. That's why I often go to cafes and restaurants. I even worked
at a few part-time—"
"I see." One of the interviewers cuts me off gently. "Then could you tell us
why you chose to enter the construction field, rather than the restaurant
industry?"
She's a middle-aged woman, the only one of the four who looked kind, and
I finally realize I've been blabbing about an irrelevant reason for applying. I
break out in a sweat in a suit I'm not yet used to wearing.
"Well, I... Serving customers at my part-time job was fun, but I guess you
could say I wanted to be involved in something bigger..."
Something bigger? That's a middle school answer. Even I can tell my face
is flushing red.
"I mean... The way I see it, there's no telling when even Tokyo could
disappear."
This time, the interviewers' faces really do cloud over. Realizing I've been
touching the back of my neck, I hastily put hands on my knees again.
"So if it does— No, precisely because it will someday, I want to create the
sort of town that warms people, even if it's only a memory—"
Agh, it's no good. Even I can't follow what I'm saying. I've failed this one,

interviewers, and I feel like crying.`,length:1808,num_lines:29,location:"Interview Room",importance:.8,conflict:.6,characters:[{name:"Middle-aged Interviewer",role:"Gentle questioner guiding the interview",importance:.7,emotion:"Kind but probing",sentiment:.5,quote:"I see.

Job hunting, hmm?"
Okudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.
It's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly
languid hum of people released from their days at work or school.
"Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great."
"Hmm..." Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She
inspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, "You don't
think it's because suits don't look good on you?"
"I-is it really that bad?!" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.
"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!"
Okudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.
"Let's walk a little," Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,
going against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut
across Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that
the trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass
have on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,
too.
"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue."
Feeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to
Okudera-senpai beside me.
"What?" Her glossy lips pout. "I can't get in touch with you without a
reason?"
"No, no, no!" I wave my hands hastily.
"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time."
"Y-yes. I am."
She smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. "I was in the area
for work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki." She was hired by a major
clothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. "Life in the suburbs
is fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind," she tells me, gazing at
her surroundings like she's a little awestruck. "Look," she says suddenly, and I
raise my head.
We're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant
outdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage
of gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster—Eight
Years Later in big letters.
"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,
as though she's searching distant memories. "You were still in high school,
Taki, so it must've been..."
"Five years ago, maybe?" I finish the sentence for her.
"That long..." She exhales a little, as if surprised. "I'm forgetting all sorts
of things."
She's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk
up Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I
try remembering that day.
It was the summer of my second year in high school— No, it was just about
this time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short
trip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way
to Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.
Right, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the
side of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur
and grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a
vague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed
a mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to
Tokyo by myself the next day.
That's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that
comet.
In the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human
history, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,
almost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the
comet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and
most of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.
It was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all
sorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical
phenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the
media's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around
wildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit
with Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or
questioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an
evacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been
foretold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so
isolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the
power across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite
strike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the
programs to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as
with most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of
Itomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.
Still... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of
Itomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had
materialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had
visited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.
What in the world had it been?
Well, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink
into the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I
write the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job
next year, not ancient history I don't really remember.
"The wind's come up," Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair
rises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,
reaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a
melancholy inside me.
"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough," Okudera-senpai
says when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.`,length:5873,num_lines:91,location:"Station",importance:.8,conflict:.2,characters:[{name:"Okudera-senpai",role:"Supportive friend, checking in on Taki",importance:.9,emotion:"Playful and nostalgic",sentiment:.7,quote:"I was in the area for work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:1},{name:"Taki Tachibana",role:"Job seeker, reflecting on past memories",importance:.8,emotion:"Nostalgic and uncertain",sentiment:-.2,quote:"Well, I guess it's not important.",fake_quote:"",importance_rank:2}],number:4,importance_rank:4,conflict_rank:4},{title:"A Chance Meeting",summary:"The protagonist sees someone significant on the train, realizing their wish.",chapter:"Chapter Eight Your Name.",first_line:309,last_line:351,text:`In that instant, with absolutely no warning, I see her.
And then, I see him.
He's there, close enough to touch if it weren't for the windowpanes, on a
train running parallel to this one. He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are
wide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so
long really is.
She's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know
it's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes
between us, and I lose sight of her.
But I finally know what I'm wishing for.
I wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.
I want to be with him, just a little more.
The train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already
positive she's looking for me, too.
We've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an
assumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.
Even so, I—we—wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be
together, just a little more.
As I run along the sloping road, I wonder, Why am I running? Why am 1
searching? I probably know the answer. I don't remember it, but everything in
my body knows. I turn at a narrow alley, and the road drops off. Stairs. I walk
over to them, look down.. .and there he is.
Fighting back the urge to run, I climb the stairs slowly. A wind that smells
like flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the
top of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the
corner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts
softly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.
As we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say
anything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each
other. In that moment, I feel a tense, squeezing pain all over, as though
something inside me has taken hold of my heart. This is wrong, I think fiercely.
We can't possibly be strangers. It goes against something as basic as the
mechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...
And so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed. She's
standing on the stairs, the streets of Tokyo behind her, her eyes wide and round.
I realize her long hair is tied back with a cord the color of the evening sun. My
whole body trembles slightly.
I finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into
tears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.
Even as I cry, I smile, too. The spring air carries with it all sorts of
apprehension and anticipation, and I draw a deep breath.
Then we open our mouths at the same time.
