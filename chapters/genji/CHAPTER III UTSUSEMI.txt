LINE 1: Genji was still sleepless. 'No one has ever disliked me before' he
LINE 2: whispered to the boy. 'It is more than I can bear. I am sick of myself
LINE 3: and of the world, and do not want to go on living any more.' This
LINE 4: sounded so tragic that the boy began to weep. The smallness and
LINE 5: delicacy of his build, even the way in which his hair was cropped,
LINE 6: gave him an astonishing resemblance to his sister, thought Genji, who
LINE 7: found his sympathy very endearing. At times he had half thought of
LINE 8: creeping away from the boy's side and searching on his own account for
LINE 9: the lady's hiding-place; but soon abandoned a project which would only
LINE 10: have involved him in the most appalling scandal. So he lay, waiting
LINE 11: for the dawn. At last, while it was still dark, so full of his own
LINE 12: thoughts that he quite forgot to make his usual parting speech to his
LINE 13: young page, he left the house. The boy's feelings were very much hurt,
LINE 14: and all that day he felt lonely and injured. The lady, when no answer
LINE 15: came from Genji, thought that he had changed his mind, and though she
LINE 16: would have been very angry if he had persisted in his suit, she was
LINE 17: not quite prepared to lose him with so little ado.
LINE 18: But this was a good opportunity once and for all to lock up her heart
LINE 19: against him. She thought that she had done so successfully, but found
LINE 20: to her surprise that he still occupied an uncommonly large share of
LINE 21: her thoughts. Genji, though he felt it would have been much better
LINE 22: to put the whole business out of his head, knew that he had not the
LINE 23: strength of mind to do so and at last, unable to bear his wretchedness
LINE 24: any longer he said to the boy 'I am feeling very unhappy. I keep on
LINE 25: trying to think of other things, but my thoughts will not obey me. I
LINE 26: can struggle no longer. You must watch for a suitable occasion, and
LINE 27: then contrive some way of bringing me into the presence of your
LINE 28: sister.' This worried the boy, but he was inwardly flattered at the
LINE 29: confidence which Genji placed in him. And an opportunity soon
LINE 30: presented itself.
LINE 31: Ki no Kami had been called away to the provinces, and there were only
LINE 32: women in the house. One evening when dusk had settled upon the quiet
LINE 33: streets the boy brought a carriage to fetch him. He knew that the lad
LINE 34: would do his best, but not feeling quite safe in the hands of so young
LINE 35: an accomplice, he put on a disguise, and then in his impatience, not
LINE 36: waiting even to see the gates closed behind him, he drove off at top
LINE 37: speed. They entered unobserved at a side-gate, and here he bade Genji
LINE 38: descend. The brother knew that as he was only a boy, the watchman and
LINE 39: gardeners would not pay any particular attention to his movements, and
LINE 40: so he was not at all uneasy. Hiding Genji in the porch of the
LINE 41: double-door of the eastern wing, he purposely banged against the
LINE 42: sliding partition which separated this wing from the main part of the
LINE 43: house, and that the maids might have the impression he did not mind
LINE 44: who heard him enter he called out crossly 'Why is the door shut on a
LINE 45: hot night like this?' '"My lady of the West"[1] has been here since
LINE 46: this morning, and she is playing _go_ with my other lady.' Longing to
LINE 47: catch sight of her, even though she were with a companion, Genji stole
LINE 48: from his hiding-place, and crept through a gap in the curtains. The
LINE 49: partition door through which the boy had passed was still open,
LINE 50: and he could see through it, right along the corridor into the room on
LINE 51: the other side. The screen which protected the entrance of this room
LINE 52: was partly folded, and the curtains which usually concealed the divan
LINE 53: had, owing to the great heat, been hooked up out of the way, so that
LINE 54: he had an excellent view.
LINE 55: The lady sitting near the lamp, half-leaning against the middle pillar
LINE 56: must, he supposed, be his beloved. He looked closely at her. She
LINE 57: seemed to be wearing an unlined, dark purple dress, with some kind of
LINE 58: scarf thrown over her shoulders. The poise of her head was graceful,
LINE 59: but her extreme smallness had the effect of making her seem somewhat
LINE 60: insignificant. She seemed to be trying all the while to hide her face
LINE 61: from her companion, and there was something furtive about the
LINE 62: movements of her slender hands, which she seemed never to show for
LINE 63: more than a moment.
LINE 64: Her companion was sitting right opposite him, and he could see her
LINE 65: perfectly. She wore an underdress of thin white stuff, and thrown
LINE 66: carelessly over it a cloak embroidered with red and blue flowers. The
LINE 67: dress was not fastened in front, showing a bare neck and breast,
LINE 68: showing even the little red sash which held up her drawers. She had
LINE 69: indeed an engagingly free and easy air. Her skin was very white and
LINE 70: delicate, she was rather plump, but tall and well built. The poise of
LINE 71: her head and angle of her brow were faultless, the expression of her
LINE 72: mouth and eyes was very pleasing and her appearance altogether most
LINE 73: delightful. Her hair grew very thick, but was cut short so as to hang
LINE 74: on a level with her shoulders. It was very fine and smooth. How
LINE 75: exciting it must be to have such a girl for one's daughter! Small
LINE 76: wonder if Iyo no Kami was proud of her. If she was a little less
LINE 77: restless, he thought, she would be quite perfect.
LINE 78: The game was nearly over, she was clearing away the unwanted pieces.
LINE 79: She seemed to be very excitable and was making a quite unnecessary
LINE 80: commotion about the business. 'Wait a little' said her companion very
LINE 81: quietly, 'here there is a stalemate. My only move is to counter-attack
LINE 82: over there....' 'It is all over' said the other impatiently 'I am
LINE 83: beaten, let us count the score;' and she began counting, 'ten, twenty,
LINE 84: thirty, forty' on her fingers. Genji could not help remembering the
LINE 85: old song about the wash-house at Iyo ('eight tubs to the left, nine
LINE 86: tubs to the right') and as this lady of Iyo, determined that nothing
LINE 87: should be left unsettled, went on stolidly counting her losses and
LINE 88: gains, he thought her for the moment slightly common. It was strange
LINE 89: to contrast her with Utsusemi,[2] who sat silent, her face
LINE 90: half-covered, so that he could scarcely discern her features. But when
LINE 91: he looked at her fixedly, she, as though uneasy under this gaze of
LINE 92: which she was not actually aware, shifted in her seat, and showed him
LINE 93: her full profile. Her eyelids gave the impression of being a little
LINE 94: swollen, and there was at places a certain lack of delicacy in the
LINE 95: lines of her features, while her good points were not visible. But
LINE 96: when she began to speak, it was as though she were determined to make
LINE 97: amends for the deficiencies of her appearance and show that she had,
LINE 98: if not so much beauty, at any rate more sense than her companion.
LINE 99: The latter was now flaunting her charms with more and more careless
LINE 100: abandonment. Her continual laughter and high spirits were certainly
LINE 101: rather engaging, and she seemed in her way to be a most entertaining
LINE 102: person. He did not imagine that she was very virtuous, but that was
LINE 103: far from being altogether a disadvantage.
LINE 104: It amused him very much to see people behaving quite naturally
LINE 105: together. He had lived in an atmosphere of ceremony and reserve.
LINE 106: This peep at everyday life was a most exciting novelty, and though he
LINE 107: felt slightly uneasy at spying in this deliberate way upon two persons
LINE 108: who had no notion that they were observed, he would gladly have gone
LINE 109: on looking, when suddenly the boy, who had been sitting by his
LINE 110: sister's side, got up, and Genji slipped back again into his proper
LINE 111: hiding-place. The boy was full of apologies at having left him waiting
LINE 112: for so long: 'But I am afraid nothing can be done to-day; there is
LINE 113: still a visitor in her room.' 'And am I now to go home again? 'said
LINE 114: Genji; 'that is really too much to ask.' 'No, no, stay here, I will
LINE 115: try what can be done, when the visitor has gone.' Genji felt quite
LINE 116: sure that the boy would manage to find some way of cajoling his
LINE 117: sister, for he had noticed that though a mere child, he had a way of
LINE 118: quietly observing situations and characters, and making use of his
LINE 119: knowledge.
LINE 120: The game of _go_ must now be over. A rustling of skirts and pattering
LINE 121: of feet showed that the household was not retiring to rest. 'Where is
LINE 122: the young master?' Genji heard a servant saying, 'I am going to fasten
LINE 123: this partition door,' and there was the sound of bolts being slipped.
LINE 124: 'They have all gone to bed' said Genji, 'now is the time to think of a
LINE 125: plan.' The boy knew that it would be no use arguing with his sister or
LINE 126: trying beforehand in any way to bend her obstinate resolution. The
LINE 127: best thing to be done under the circumstances was to wait till no one
LINE 128: was about, and then lead Genji straight to her. 'Is Ki no Kami's
LINE 129: sister still here?' asked Genji, 'I should like just to catch a
LINE 130: glimpse of her.' 'But that is impossible' said the boy 'She is in my
LINE 131: sister's room.' 'Indeed' said Genji, affecting surprise. For though he
LINE 132: knew very well where she was he did not wish to show that he had
LINE 133: already seen her. Becoming very impatient of all these delays, he
LINE 134: pointed out that it was growing very late, and there was no time to be
LINE 135: lost.
LINE 136: The boy nodded, and tapping on the main door of the women's quarters,
LINE 137: he entered. Everyone was sound asleep. 'I am going to sleep in the
LINE 138: ante-room' the boy said out loud; 'I shall leave the door open so as
LINE 139: to make a draught;' and so saying he spread his mattress on the
LINE 140: ground, and for a while pretended to be asleep. Soon however, he got
LINE 141: up and spread a screen as though to protect him from the light, and
LINE 142: under its shadow Genji slipped softly into the room.
LINE 143: Not knowing what was to happen next, and much doubting whether any
LINE 144: good would come of the venture, with great trepidation he followed the
LINE 145: boy to the curtain that screened the main bedroom, and pulling it
LINE 146: aside entered on tip-toe. But even in the drab garments which he had
LINE 147: chosen for his disguise, he seemed to the boy to cut a terribly
LINE 148: conspicuous figure as he passed through the midnight quietness of the
LINE 149: house.
LINE 150: Utsusemi meanwhile had persuaded herself that she was very glad Genji
LINE 151: had forgotten to pay his threatened visit. But she was still haunted
LINE 152: by the memory of their one strange and dreamlike meeting, and was in
LINE 153: no mood for sleep. But near her, as she lay tossing, the lady of the
LINE 154: _go_ party, delighted by her visit and all the opportunities it had
LINE 155: afforded for chattering to her heart's content, was already asleep.
LINE 156: And as she was young and had no troubles she slept very soundly. The
LINE 157: princely scent which still clung to Genji's person reached the bed.
LINE 158: Utsusemi raised her head, and fancied that she saw something move
LINE 159: behind a part of the curtain that was only of one thickness. Though it
LINE 160: was very dark she recognized Genji's figure. Filled with a sudden
LINE 161: terror and utter bewilderment, she sprang from the bed, threw a
LINE 162: fragile gauze mantle over her shoulders, and fled silently from the
LINE 163: room.
LINE 164: A moment later Genji entered. He saw with delight that there was only
LINE 165: one person in the room, and that the bed was arranged for two. He
LINE 166: threw off his cloak, and advanced towards the sleeping figure. She
LINE 167: seemed a more imposing figure than he had expected, but this did not
LINE 168: trouble him. It did indeed seem rather strange that she should be so
LINE 169: sound asleep. Gradually he realized with horror that it was not she at
LINE 170: all. 'It is no use' thought Genji 'saying that I have come to the
LINE 171: wrong room, for I have no business anywhere here. Nor is it worth
LINE 172: while pursuing my real lady, for she would not have vanished like this
LINE 173: if she cared a straw about me.' What if it were the lady he had seen
LINE 174: by the lamplight? She might not after all prove a bad exchange! But no
LINE 175: sooner had he thought this than he was horrified at his own frivolity.
LINE 176: She opened her eyes. She was naturally somewhat startled, but did not
LINE 177: seem to be at all seriously put out. She was a thoughtless creature in
LINE 178: whose life no very strong emotion had ever played a part. Hers was the
LINE 179: flippancy that goes with inexperience, and even this sudden visitation
LINE 180: did not seem very much to perturb her.
LINE 181: He meant at first to explain that it was not to see her that he had
LINE 182: come. But to do so would have been to give away the secret which
LINE 183: Utsusemi so jealously guarded from the world. There was nothing for
LINE 184: it, but to pretend that his repeated visits to the house, of which the
LINE 185: lady was well aware, had been made in the hope of meeting her! This
LINE 186: was a story which would not have withstood the most cursory
LINE 187: examination; but, outrageous as it was, the girl accepted it without
LINE 188: hesitation.
LINE 189: He did not by any means dislike her, but at that moment all his
LINE 190: thoughts were busy with the lady who had so mysteriously vanished. No
LINE 191: doubt she was congratulating herself in some safe hiding-place upon
LINE 192: the absurd situation in which she had left him. Really, she was the
LINE 193: most obstinate creature in the world! What was the use of running
LINE 194: after her? But all the same she continued to obsess him.
LINE 195: But the girl in front of him was young and gay and charming. They were
LINE 196: soon getting on very well together.
LINE 197: 'Is not this kind of thing much more amusing than what happens with
LINE 198: people whom one knows?' asked Genji a little later. 'Do not think
LINE 199: unkindly of me. Our meeting must for the present remain a secret. I am
LINE 200: in a position which does not always allow me to act as I please. Your
LINE 201: people too would no doubt interfere if they should hear of it, which
LINE 202: would be very tiresome. Wait patiently, and do not forget me.' These
LINE 203: rather tepid injunctions did not strike her as at all unsatisfactory,
LINE 204: and she answered very seriously 'I am afraid it will not be very easy
LINE 205: for me even to write to you. People would think it very odd.' 'Of
LINE 206: course we must not let ordinary people into our secret' he answered,
LINE 207: 'but there is no reason why this little page should not sometimes
LINE 208: carry a message. Meanwhile not a word to anyone!' And with that he
LINE 209: left her, taking as he did so Utsusemi's thin scarf which had slipped
LINE 210: from her shoulders when she fled from the room.
LINE 211: He went to wake his page who was lying not far away. The boy sprang
LINE 212: instantly to his feet, for he was sleeping very lightly, not knowing
LINE 213: when his help might be required. He opened the door as quietly as he
LINE 214: could. 'Who is that?' someone called out in great alarm. It was the
LINE 215: voice of an old woman who worked in the house. 'It is I' answered the
LINE 216: boy uneasily. 'What are you walking about here for at this time of
LINE 217: night?' and scolding as she came, she began to advance towards the
LINE 218: door. 'Bother her' thought the boy, but he answered hastily 'It's all
LINE 219: right, I am only going outside for a minute;' but just as Genji passed
LINE 220: through the door, the moon of dawn suddenly emerged in all her
LINE 221: brightness. Seeing a grown man's figure appear in the doorway 'Whom
LINE 222: have you got with you?' the old lady asked, and then answering her own
LINE 223: question 'Why it is Mimbu! what an outrageous height that girl has
LINE 224: grown to!' and continuing to imagine that the boy was walking with
LINE 225: Mimbu, a maid-servant whose lankiness was a standing joke in the
LINE 226: house, 'and you will soon be as big as she is, little Master!' she
LINE 227: cried, and so saying came out through the door that they had just
LINE 228: passed through. Genji felt very uncomfortable, and making no answer on
LINE 229: the supposed Mimbu's behalf, he stood in the shadow at the end of the
LINE 230: corridor, hiding himself as best he could. 'You have been on duty,
LINE 231: haven't you dear?' said the old lady as she came towards them. 'I have
LINE 232: been terribly bad with the colic since yesterday and was lying up, but
LINE 233: they were shorthanded last night, and I had to go and help, though I
LINE 234: did feel very queer all the while.' And then, without waiting for them
LINE 235: to answer, 'Oh, my pain, my poor pain' she muttered 'I can't stop here
LINE 236: talking like this' and she hobbled past them without looking up.
LINE 237: So narrow an escape made Genji wonder more than ever whether the whole
LINE 238: thing was worth while. He drove back to his house, with the boy riding
LINE 239: as his postillion.
LINE 240: Here he told him the story of his evening's adventure. 'A pretty mess
LINE 241: you made of it!' And when he had finished scolding the boy for his
LINE 242: incompetence, he began to rail at the sister's irritating prudishness.
LINE 243: The poor child felt very unhappy, but could think of nothing to say in
LINE 244: his own or his sister's defence.
LINE 245: 'I am utterly wretched' said Genji. 'It is obvious that she would not
LINE 246: have behaved as she did last night unless she absolutely detested me.
LINE 247: But she might at least have the decency to send civil answers to my
LINE 248: letters. Oh, well, I suppose Iyo no Kami is the better man....' So he
LINE 249: spoke, thinking that she desired only to be rid of him. Yet when
LINE 250: at last he lay down to rest, he was wearing her scarf hidden under his
LINE 251: dress. He had put the boy by his side, and after giving much vent to
LINE 252: his exasperation, he said at last 'I am very fond of you, but I am
LINE 253: afraid in future I shall always think of you in connection with this
LINE 254: hateful business, and that will put an end to our friendship.' He said
LINE 255: it with such conviction that the boy felt quite forlorn.
LINE 256: For a while they rested, but Genji could not sleep, and at dawn he
LINE 257: sent in haste for his ink-stone. He did not write a proper letter, but
LINE 258: scribbled on a piece of folded paper, in the manner of a writing
LINE 259: exercise, a poem in which he compared the scarf which she had dropped
LINE 260: in her flight to the dainty husk which the cicada sheds on some bank
LINE 261: beneath a tree.
LINE 262: The boy picked the paper up, and thrust it into the folds of his dress.
LINE 263: Genji was very much distressed at the thought of what the other lady's
LINE 264: feelings must be; but after some reflection he decided that it would
LINE 265: be better not to send any message.
LINE 266: The scarf, to which still clung the delicate perfume of its owner, he
LINE 267: wore for long afterwards beneath his dress.
LINE 268: When the boy got home he found his sister waiting for him in very
LINE 269: ill-humour. 'It was not your doing that I escaped from the odious
LINE 270: quandary in which you landed me! And even so pray what explanation can
LINE 271: I offer to my friend?' 'A fine little clown the Prince must think you
LINE 272: now. I hope you are ashamed of yourself.'
LINE 273: Despite the fact that both parties were using him so ill, the boy drew
LINE 274: the rescued verses from out the folds of his dress and handed them to
LINE 275: her. She could not forbear to read them. What of this discarded
LINE 276: mantle? Why should he speak of it? _The coat that the fishers of Iseo
LINE 277: left lying upon the shore ..._[3] those were the words that came into
LINE 278: her mind, but they were not the clue. She was sorely puzzled.
LINE 279: Meanwhile the Lady of the West[4] was feeling very ill at ease. She
LINE 280: was longing to talk about what had happened, but must not do so, and
LINE 281: had to bear the burden of her impatience all alone. The arrival of
LINE 282: Utsusemi's brother put her into a great state of excitement. No letter
LINE 283: for her? she could not understand it at all, and for the first time a
LINE 284: cloud settled upon her gay confiding heart.
LINE 285: Utsusemi, though she had so fiercely steeled herself against his love,
LINE 286: seeing such tenderness hidden under the words of his message, again
LINE 287: fell to longing that she were free, and though there was no undoing
LINE 288: what was done she found it so hard to go without him that she took up
LINE 289: the folded paper and wrote in the margin a poem in which she said that
LINE 290: her sleeve, so often wet with tears, was like the cicada's
LINE 291: dew-drenched wing.
LINE 292: [1] Ki no Kami's sister, referred to later in the story as Nokiba no
LINE 293: Ogi.
LINE 294: [2] This name means 'cicada 'and is given to her later in the story in
LINE 295: reference to the scarf which she 'discarded as a cicada sheds its
LINE 296: husk.' But at this point it becomes grammatically important that she
LINE 297: should have a name and I therefore anticipate.
LINE 298: [3] Allusion to the old poem, 'Does he know that since he left me my
LINE 299: eyes are wet as the coat that the fishers ... left lying upon the
LINE 300: shore?'
LINE 301: [4] The visitor.
