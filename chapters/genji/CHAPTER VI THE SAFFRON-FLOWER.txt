LINE 1: Try as he might he could not dispel the melancholy into which Yūgao's
LINE 2: sudden death[1] had cast him, and though many months had gone by he
LINE 3: longed for her passionately as ever. In other quarters where he had
LINE 4: looked for affection, coldness vied with coldness and pride with
LINE 5: pride. He longed to escape once more from the claims of these
LINE 6: passionate and exacting natures, and renew the life of tender intimacy
LINE 7: which for a while had given him so great a happiness. But alas, no
LINE 8: second Yūgao would he ever find. Despite his bitter experience he
LINE 9: still fancied that one day he might at least discover some beautiful
LINE 10: girl of humble origin whom he could meet without concealment, and he
LINE 11: listened eagerly to any hint that was likely to put him upon a
LINE 12: promising track. If the prospects seemed favourable he would follow up
LINE 13: his enquiries by writing a discreet letter which, as he knew from
LINE 14: experience, would seldom indeed meet with a wholly discouraging reply.
LINE 15: Even those who seemed bent on showing by the prim stiffness of their
LINE 16: answers that they placed virtue high above sensibility, and who at
LINE 17: first appeared hardly conversant with the usages of polite society,
LINE 18: would suddenly collapse into the wildest intimacy which would continue
LINE 19: until their marriage with some commonplace husband cut short the
LINE 20: correspondence.
LINE 21: There were vacant moments when he thought of Utsusemi with regret. And
LINE 22: there was her companion too; some time or other there would surely be
LINE 23: an opportunity of sending her a surprise message. If only he could see
LINE 24: her again as he had seen her that night sitting by the chess-board in
LINE 25: the dim lamplight. It was not indeed in his nature ever to forget
LINE 26: anyone of whom he had once been fond.
LINE 27: Among his old nurses there was one called Sayemon to whom, next after
LINE 28: Koremitsu's mother, he was most deeply attached. She had a daughter
LINE 29: called Taifu no Myōbu who was in service at the Palace. This girl was
LINE 30: an illegitimate child of a certain member of the Imperial family who
LINE 31: was then Vice-minister of the Board of War. She was a young person of
LINE 32: very lively disposition and Genji often made use of her services. Her
LINE 33: mother, Genji's nurse, had afterwards married the governor of Echizen
LINE 34: and had gone with him to his province, so the girl when she was not at
LINE 35: the Palace lived chiefly at her father's.
LINE 36: She happened one day when she was talking with Genji to mention a
LINE 37: certain princess, daughter of the late Prince Hitachi. This lady, she
LINE 38: said, was born to the Prince when he was quite an old man and every
LINE 39: care had been lavished upon her upbringing. Since his death she had
LINE 40: lived alone and was very unhappy. Genji's sympathy was aroused and he
LINE 41: began to question Myōbu about this unfortunate lady. 'I do not really
LINE 42: know much either about her character or her appearance' said Myōbu;
LINE 43: 'she is extremely seclusive in her habits. Sometimes I have talked to
LINE 44: her a little in the evening, but always with a curtain between us. I
LINE 45: believe her zithern is the only companion in whom she is willing to
LINE 46: confide.' 'Of the Three Friends[2] one at least would in her case be
LINE 47: unsuitable' said Genji. 'But I should like to hear her play; her
LINE 48: father was a great performer on this instrument and it is
LINE 49: unlikely that she has not inherited some of his skill.' 'Oh, I am
LINE 50: afraid she is not worth your coming to hear,' said Myōbu. 'You are
LINE 51: very discouraging,' he answered, 'but all the same I shall hide there
LINE 52: one of these nights when the full moon is behind the clouds and listen
LINE 53: to her playing; and you shall come with me.' She was not best pleased;
LINE 54: but just then even upon the busy Palace a springtime quiet seemed to
LINE 55: have settled, and being quite at leisure she consented to accompany
LINE 56: him. Her father's house was at some distance from the town and for
LINE 57: convenience he sometimes lodged in Prince Hitachi's palace. Myōbo got
LINE 58: on badly with her step-mother, and taking a fancy to the lonely
LINE 59: princess's quarters she kept a room there.
LINE 60: It was indeed on the night after the full moon, in just such a veiled
LINE 61: light as Genji had spoken of, that they visited the Hitachi palace. 'I
LINE 62: am afraid,' said Myōbu, 'that it is not a very good night for
LINE 63: listening to music; sounds do not seem to carry very well.' But he
LINE 64: would not be thus put off. 'Go to her room' he said, 'and persuade her
LINE 65: to play a few notes; it would be a pity if I went away without hearing
LINE 66: her at all.' Myōbu felt somewhat shy of leaving him like this in her
LINE 67: own little private room. She found the princess sitting by the window,
LINE 68: her shutters not yet closed for the night; she was enjoying the scent
LINE 69: of a blossoming plum-tree which stood in the garden just outside. It
LINE 70: did indeed seem just the right moment. 'I thought how lovely your
LINE 71: zithern would sound on such a night as this,' she said, 'and could not
LINE 72: resist coming to see you. I am always in such a hurry, going to and
LINE 73: from the Palace, that do you know I have never had time to hear you
LINE 74: play. It is such a pity.' 'Music of this sort,' she replied, 'gives no
LINE 75: pleasure to those who have not studied it. What do they care for such
LINE 76: matters _who all day long run hither and thither in the City of a
LINE 77: Hundred Towers_?'[3] She sent for her zithern; but her heart beat fast.
LINE 78: What impression would her playing make upon this girl? Timidly she
LINE 79: sounded a few notes. The effect was very agreeable. True, she was not
LINE 80: a great performer; but the instrument was a particularly fine one and
LINE 81: Genji found her playing by no means unpleasant to listen to.
LINE 82: Living in this lonely and half-ruined palace after such an upbringing
LINE 83: (full no doubt of antiquated formalities and restrictions) as her
LINE 84: father was likely to have given her it would be strange indeed if her
LINE 85: life did not for the most part consist of memories and regrets. This
LINE 86: was just the sort of place which in an old tale would be chosen as the
LINE 87: scene for the most romantic happenings. His imagination thus stirred,
LINE 88: he thought of sending her a message. But perhaps she would think this
LINE 89: rather sudden. For some reason he felt shy, and hesitated.
LINE 90: 'It seems to be clouding over,' said the astute Myōbu, who knew that
LINE 91: Genji would carry away a far deeper impression if he heard no more for
LINE 92: the present. 'Someone was coming to see me' she continued; 'I must
LINE 93: not keep him waiting. Perhaps some other time when I am not in such a
LINE 94: hurry.... Let me close your window for you,' and with that she
LINE 95: rejoined Genji, giving the princess no encouragement to play any more.
LINE 96: 'She stopped so soon,' he complained, 'that it was hardly worth
LINE 97: getting her to play at all. One had not time to catch the drift of
LINE 98: what she was playing. Really it was a pity!' That the princess was
LINE 99: beautiful he made no doubt at all. 'I should be very much obliged if
LINE 100: you would arrange for me to hear her at closer quarters.' But Myōbu,
LINE 101: thinking that this would lead to disappointment, told him that the
LINE 102: princess who led so hermit-like an existence and seemed always so
LINE 103: depressed and subdued would hardly welcome the suggestion that
LINE 104: she should perform before a stranger. 'Of course,' said Genji, 'a
LINE 105: thing of that kind could only be suggested between people who were on
LINE 106: familiar terms or to someone of very different rank. This lady's rank,
LINE 107: as I am perfectly well aware, entitles her to be treated with every
LINE 108: consideration, and I would not ask you to do more than hint at my
LINE 109: desire.' He had promised to meet someone else that night and carefully
LINE 110: disguising himself he was preparing to depart when Myōbu said laughing
LINE 111: 'It amuses me sometimes to think how the Emperor deplores the too
LINE 112: strict and domesticated life which he suffers you to lead. What would
LINE 113: he think if he could see you disguising yourself like this?' Genji
LINE 114: laughed. 'I am afraid,' he said as he left the room, 'that you are not
LINE 115: quite the right person to denounce me. Those who think such conduct
LINE 116: reprehensible in a man must find it even less excusable in a girl.'
LINE 117: She remembered that Genji had often been obliged to reproach her for
LINE 118: her reckless flirtations, and blushing made no reply.
LINE 119: Still hoping to catch a glimpse of the zithern-player he crept softly
LINE 120: towards her window. He was about to hide at a point where the
LINE 121: bamboo-fence was somewhat broken down when he perceived that a man was
LINE 122: already ensconced there. Who could it be? No doubt it was one of the
LINE 123: princess's lovers and he stepped back to conceal himself in the
LINE 124: darkness. The stranger followed him and turned out to be no other than
LINE 125: Tō no Chūjō. That evening they had left the Palace together, but when
LINE 126: they parted Genji (Chūjō had noticed) did not either go in the
LINE 127: direction of the Great Hall nor back to his own palace. This aroused
LINE 128: Chūjō's curiosity and, despite the fact that he too had a secret
LINE 129: appointment that night, he decided first to follow Genji and discover
LINE 130: what was afoot. So riding upon a strange horse and wearing a
LINE 131: hunting-cloak, he had got himself up altogether so villainously
LINE 132: that he was able to follow Genji without being recognized upon the
LINE 133: road. Seeing him enter so unexpected a place, Chūjō was trying to
LINE 134: imagine what business his friend could possibly have in such a quarter
LINE 135: when the music began and he secreted himself with a vague idea of
LINE 136: waylaying Genji when he came out. But the prince, not knowing who the
LINE 137: stranger was and frightened of being recognized, stole on tip-toe into
LINE 138: the shadow. Chūjō suddenly accosted him: 'Though you shook me off so
LINE 139: uncivilly, I thought it my duty to keep an eye on you' he said, and
LINE 140: recited the poem: 'Though together we left the great Palace hill, your
LINE 141: setting-place you would not show me, Moon of the sixteenth night!'
LINE 142: Thus he remonstrated; and Genji, though at first he had been somewhat
LINE 143: put out by finding that he was not alone, when he recognized Tō no
LINE 144: Chūjō could not help being rather amused. 'This is indeed an
LINE 145: unexpected attention on your part' he said, and expressed his slight
LINE 146: annoyance in the answering verse: 'Though wheresoever it shines men
LINE 147: marvel at its light, who has before thought fit to follow the full
LINE 148: moon to the hill whereon it sets?'
LINE 149: 'It is most unsafe for you to go about like this,' said Chūjō. 'I
LINE 150: really mean it. You ought always to have a bodyguard; then you are all
LINE 151: right whatever happens. I wish you would always let me come with you.
LINE 152: I am afraid that these clandestine expeditions may one day get you
LINE 153: into trouble,' and he solemnly repeated the warning. What chiefly
LINE 154: worried Genji was the thought that this might not be the first
LINE 155: occasion upon which Chūjō had followed him; but if it had been his
LINE 156: habit to do so it was certainly very tactful of him never to have
LINE 157: questioned Genji about Yūgao's child.[4]
LINE 158: Though each of them had an appointment elsewhere, they agreed not
LINE 159: to part. Both of them got into Genji's carriage and the moon having
LINE 160: vanished behind a cloud, beguiled the way to the Great Hall by playing
LINE 161: a duet upon their flutes. They did not send for torch-bearers to see
LINE 162: them in at the gates, but creeping in very quietly stole to a portico
LINE 163: where they could not be seen and had their ordinary clothes brought to
LINE 164: them there. Having changed, they entered the house merrily blowing
LINE 165: their flutes as though they had just come back from the Palace.
LINE 166: Chūjō's father, who usually pretended not to hear them when they
LINE 167: returned late at night, on this occasion brought out his flageolet,
LINE 168: which was his favourite instrument, and began to play very agreeably.
LINE 169: Aoi sent for her zithern and made all her ladies play on the
LINE 170: instruments at which they excelled. Only Nakatsukasa, though she was
LINE 171: known for her lute-playing, having thrown over Tō no Chūjō who had
LINE 172: been her lover because of her infatuation for Genji with whom her sole
LINE 173: intercourse was that she sometimes saw him casually when he visited
LINE 174: the Great Hall,—only Nakatsukasa sat drooping listlessly; for her
LINE 175: passion had become known to Aoi's mother and the rest, and they were
LINE 176: being very unpleasant about it. She was thinking in her despair that
LINE 177: perhaps it would be better if she went and lived in some place where
LINE 178: she would never see Genji at all; but the step was hard to take and
LINE 179: she was very unhappy.
LINE 180: The young princes were thinking of the music they had heard earlier in
LINE 181: the evening, of those romantic surroundings tinged with a peculiar and
LINE 182: inexplicable beauty. Merely because it pleased him so to imagine her,
LINE 183: Tō no Chūjō had already endowed the occupant of the lonely mansion
LINE 184: with every charm. He had quite decided that Genji had been courting
LINE 185: her for months or even years, and thought impatiently that he for his
LINE 186: part, if like Genji he were violently in love with a lady of this
LINE 187: kind, would have been willing to risk a few reproaches or even
LINE 188: the loss of a little reputation. He could not however believe that his
LINE 189: friend intended to let the matter rest as it was much longer and
LINE 190: determined to amuse himself by a little rivalry. From that time
LINE 191: onwards both of them sent letters to the lady, but neither ever
LINE 192: received any answer. This both vexed and puzzled them. What could be
LINE 193: the reason? Thinking that such images were suitable to a lady brought
LINE 194: up in these rustic surroundings, in most of the poems which they sent
LINE 195: her they alluded to delicate trees and flowers or other aspects of
LINE 196: nature, hoping sooner or later to hit on some topic which would arouse
LINE 197: her interest in their suit. Though she was of good birth and
LINE 198: education, perhaps through being so long buried away in her vast
LINE 199: mansion she had not any longer the wits to write a reply. And what
LINE 200: indeed did it matter whether she answered or not, thought Tō no Chūjō,
LINE 201: who none the less was somewhat piqued. With his usual frankness he
LINE 202: said to Genji: 'I wonder whether you have had any answer. I must
LINE 203: confess that as an experiment I too sent a mild hint, but without any
LINE 204: success, so I have not repeated it.' 'So he too has been trying his
LINE 205: hand,' thought Genji smiling to himself. 'No,' he answered aloud, 'my
LINE 206: letter did not need an answer, which was perhaps the reason that I did
LINE 207: not receive one.' From this enigmatic reply Chūjō deduced that Genji
LINE 208: had been in communication of some kind with the lady and he was
LINE 209: slightly piqued by the fact that she had shown a preference between
LINE 210: them. Genji's deeper feelings were in no way involved, and though his
LINE 211: vanity was a little wounded he would not have pursued the matter
LINE 212: farther had he not known the persuasive power of Chūjō's style, and
LINE 213: feared that even now she might overcome her scruples and send him a
LINE 214: reply. Chūjō would become insufferably cock-a-hoop if he got into his
LINE 215: head the idea that the princess had transferred her affections from
LINE 216: Genji to himself. He must see what Myōbu could be persuaded to
LINE 217: do. 'I cannot understand,' he said to her, 'why the princess should
LINE 218: refuse to take any notice of my letters. It is really very uncivil of
LINE 219: her. I suppose she thinks I am a frivolous person who intends to amuse
LINE 220: himself a little in her company and then disappear. It is a strangely
LINE 221: false conception of my character. As you know, my affections never
LINE 222: alter, and if I have ever seemed to the world to be unfaithful it has
LINE 223: always been because in reality my suit had met with some unexpected
LINE 224: discouragement. But this lady is so placed that no opposition from
LINE 225: parents or brothers can interrupt our friendship, and if she will but
LINE 226: trust me she will find that her being alone in the world, so far from
LINE 227: exposing her to callous treatment, makes her the more attractive.'
LINE 228: 'Come,' answered Myōbu, 'it will never do for you to run away with the
LINE 229: idea that you can treat this great lady as a pleasant wayside
LINE 230: distraction; on the contrary she is extremely difficult of access and
LINE 231: her rank has accustomed her to be treated with deference and
LINE 232: ceremony.' So spoke Myōbu, in accordance indeed with her own
LINE 233: experience of the princess. 'She has evidently no desire to be thought
LINE 234: clever or dashing' said Genji; 'for some reason I imagine her as very
LINE 235: gentle and forgiving.' He was thinking of Yūgao when he said this.
LINE 236: Soon after this he fell sick of his fever and after that was occupied
LINE 237: by a matter of great secrecy; so that spring and summer had both
LINE 238: passed away before he could again turn his attention to the lonely
LINE 239: lady. But in the autumn came a time of quiet meditation and reflexion.
LINE 240: Again the sound of the cloth-beaters' mallets reached his ears,
LINE 241: tormenting him with memories and longings. He wrote many letters to
LINE 242: the zithern-player, but with no more success than before. Her
LINE 243: churlishness exasperated him. More than ever he was determined not to
LINE 244: give in, and sending for Myōbu he scolded her for having been of
LINE 245: so little assistance to him. 'What can be going on in the princess's
LINE 246: mind?' he said; 'such strange behaviour I have never met with before.'
LINE 247: If he was piqued and surprised, Myōbu for her part was vexed that the
LINE 248: affair had gone so badly. 'No one can say that you have done anything
LINE 249: so very eccentric or indiscreet, and I do not think she feels so. If
LINE 250: she does not answer your letters it is only part of her general
LINE 251: unwillingness to face the outer world.' 'But such a way of behaving is
LINE 252: positively barbarous,' said Genji; 'if she were a girl in her 'teens
LINE 253: and under the care of parents or guardians, such timidity might be
LINE 254: pardoned; but in an independent woman it is inconceivable. I would
LINE 255: never have written had I not taken it for granted that she had some
LINE 256: experience of the world. I was merely hoping that I had found someone
LINE 257: who in moments of idleness or depression would respond to me
LINE 258: sympathetically. I did not address her in the language of gallantry,
LINE 259: but only begged for permission sometimes to converse with her in that
LINE 260: strange and lonely dwelling-place. But since she seems unable to
LINE 261: understand what it is I am asking of her, we must see what can be done
LINE 262: without waiting for her permission. If you will help me, you may be
LINE 263: sure I shall not disgrace you in any way.'
LINE 264: Myōbu had once been in the habit of describing to him the appearance
LINE 265: of people whom she had chanced to meet and he always listened to such
LINE 266: accounts with insatiable interest and curiosity; but for a long while
LINE 267: he had paid no attention to her reports. Now for no reason at all the
LINE 268: mere mention of the princess's existence had aroused in him a fever of
LINE 269: excitement and activity. It was all very unaccountable. Probably he
LINE 270: would find the poor lady extremely unattractive when he saw her and
LINE 271: she would be doing her a very poor service in effecting the
LINE 272: introduction; but to give Genji no help in a matter to which he
LINE 273: evidently attached so much importance, would seem very ill-natured.
LINE 274: Even in Prince Hitachi's life-time visitors to this stiff,
LINE 275: old-fashioned establishment had been very rare, and now no foot at all
LINE 276: ever made its way through the thickets which were closing in around
LINE 277: the house. It may be imagined then what the visit of so celebrated a
LINE 278: person as Genji would have meant to the ladies-in-waiting and lesser
LINE 279: persons of the household and with what urgency they begged their
LINE 280: mistress to send a favourable reply. But the same desperate shyness
LINE 281: still possessed her and Genji's letters she would not even read.
LINE 282: Hearing this Myōbu determined to submit Genji's request to her at some
LINE 283: suitable moment when she and the princess were carrying on one of
LINE 284: their usual uneasy conversations, with the princess's screen-of-honour
LINE 285: planted between them. 'If she seems displeased,' thought Myōbu, 'I
LINE 286: will positively have nothing more to do with the matter; but if she
LINE 287: receives him and some sort of an affair starts between them, there is
LINE 288: fortunately no one connected with her to scold me or get me into
LINE 289: trouble.' As the result of these and other reflections, being quite at
LINE 290: home in matters of this kind, she sensibly decided to say nothing
LINE 291: about the business to anybody, not even to her father.
LINE 292: Late one night, soon after the twentieth day of the eighth month, the
LINE 293: princess sat waiting for the moon to rise. Though the star-light shone
LINE 294: clear and lovely the moaning of the wind in the pine-tree branches
LINE 295: oppressed her with its melancholy, and growing weary of waiting she
LINE 296: was with many tears and sighs recounting to Myōbu stories of bygone
LINE 297: men and days.
LINE 298: Now was the time to convey Genji's message, thought Myōbu. She sent
LINE 299: for him, and secretly as before he crept up to the palace. The moon
LINE 300: was just rising. He stood where the neglected bamboo-hedge grew
LINE 301: somewhat sparsely and watched. Persuaded by Myōbu the princess was
LINE 302: already at her zithern. So far as he could hear it at this
LINE 303: distance, he did not find the music displeasing; but Myōbu in her
LINE 304: anxiety and confusion thought the tune very dull and wished it would
LINE 305: occur to the princess to play something rather more up-to-date. The
LINE 306: place where Genji was waiting was well screened from view and he had
LINE 307: no difficulty in creeping unobserved into the house. Here he called
LINE 308: for Myōbu, who pretending that the visit was a complete surprise to
LINE 309: her said to the princess: 'I am so sorry, here is Prince Genji come to
LINE 310: see me. I am always getting into trouble with him for failing to
LINE 311: secure him your favour. I have really done my best, but you do not
LINE 312: make it possible for me to give him any encouragement, so now I
LINE 313: imagine he has come to deal with the matter for himself. What am I to
LINE 314: say to him? I can answer for it that he will do nothing violent or
LINE 315: rash. I think that considering all the trouble he has taken you might
LINE 316: at least tell him that you will speak to him through a screen or
LINE 317: curtain.' The idea filled the princess with consternation. 'I should
LINE 318: not know what to say to him,' she wailed and as she said the words
LINE 319: bolted towards the far side of the room with a bashfulness so
LINE 320: infantile that Myōbu could not help laughing. 'Indeed, Madam,' she
LINE 321: said, 'it is childish of you to take the matter to heart in this way.
LINE 322: If you were an ordinary young lady under the eye of stern parents and
LINE 323: brothers, one could understand it; but for a person in your position
LINE 324: to go on for ever being afraid to face the world is fantastic.' So
LINE 325: Myōbu admonished her and the princess, who could never think of any
LINE 326: argument against doing what she was told to do, said at last: 'If I
LINE 327: have only to listen and need not say anything he may speak to me from
LINE 328: behind the lattice-door, so long as it is well locked.' 'I cannot ask
LINE 329: him to sit on the servant's bench,' said Myōbu. 'You really need not
LINE 330: be afraid that he will do anything violent or sudden.' Thus persuaded,
LINE 331: the princess went to a hatch which communicated between the
LINE 332: women's quarters and the strangers' dais and firmly locking it with
LINE 333: her own hand stuffed a mattress against it to make sure that no chink
LINE 334: was left unstopped. She was in such a terrible state of confusion that
LINE 335: she had not the least idea what she should say to her visitor, if she
LINE 336: had to speak to him, and had agreed to listen to him only because
LINE 337: Myōbu told her that she ought to.
LINE 338: Several elderly serving-women of the wet-nurse type had been lying
LINE 339: half-asleep in the inner room since dusk. There were however one or
LINE 340: two younger maids who had heard a great deal about this Prince Genji
LINE 341: and were ready to fall in love with him at a moment's notice. They now
LINE 342: brought out their lady's handsomest dress and persuaded her to let
LINE 343: them put her a little to rights; but she displayed no interest in
LINE 344: these preparations. Myōbu meanwhile was thinking how well Genji looked
LINE 345: in the picturesque disguise which he had elaborated for use on these
LINE 346: night excursions and wished it were being employed in some quarter
LINE 347: where it was more likely to be appreciated. Her only consolation was
LINE 348: that so mild a lady was not likely to make inordinate demands upon him
LINE 349: or pester him with jealousies and exactions. On the other hand, she
LINE 350: was rather worried about the princess. 'What' thought Myōbu, 'if she
LINE 351: should fall in love with him and her heart be broken merely because I
LINE 352: was frightened of getting scolded?'
LINE 353: Remembering her rank and upbringing, he was far from expecting her to
LINE 354: behave with the lively pertness of an up-to-date miss. She would be
LINE 355: langorous; yes, langorous and passionate. When, half-pushed by Myōbu,
LINE 356: the princess at last took her stand near the partition where she was
LINE 357: to converse with her visitor, a delicious scent of sandal-wood[5]
LINE 358: invaded his nostrils, and this piece of coquetry at once raised
LINE 359: his hopes. He began to tell her with great earnestness and eloquence
LINE 360: how for almost a year she had continually occupied his thoughts. But
LINE 361: not a word did she answer; talking to her was no better than writing!
LINE 362: Irritated beyond measure he recited the verse: 'If with a Vow of
LINE 363: Silence thus ten times and again my combat I renew, 'tis that against
LINE 364: me at least no sentence of muteness has been passed.' 'Speak at least
LINE 365: one word of dismissal,' he continued; 'do not leave me in this
LINE 366: bewilderment.' There was among her ladies one called Jijū, the
LINE 367: daughter of her old nurse. Being a girl of great liveliness and
LINE 368: intelligence she could not bear to see her mistress cutting such a
LINE 369: figure as this and stepping to her side she answered with the poem:
LINE 370: 'The bell[6] had sounded and for a moment silence was imposed upon my
LINE 371: lips. To have kept you waiting grieves me, and there let the matter
LINE 372: rest.' She said the words in such a way that Genji was completely
LINE 373: taken in and thought it was the princess who had thus readily answered
LINE 374: his poem. He had not expected such smartness from an aristocratic lady
LINE 375: of the old school; but the surprise was agreeable and he answered:
LINE 376: 'Madam, you have won the day,' adding the verse: 'Though well I know
LINE 377: that thoughts unspoken count more than thoughts expressed, yet
LINE 378: dumb-crambo is not a cheering game to play.'
LINE 379: He went on to speak of one trifle or another as it occurred to him,
LINE 380: doing his very best to entertain her; but it was no use. Thinking at
LINE 381: last that silence might after all in this strange creature be merely a
LINE 382: sign of deep emotion he could no longer restrain his curiosity and,
LINE 383: easily pushing back the bolted door, entered the room. Myōbu, seeing
LINE 384: with consternation that he had falsified all her assurances, thought
LINE 385: it better to know nothing of what followed and without turning her
LINE 386: head rushed away to her own apartments. Jijū and the other
LINE 387: ladies-in-waiting had heard so much about Genji and were so anxious to
LINE 388: catch sight of him that they were more than ready to forgive his
LINE 389: uncivil intrusion. Their only fear was that their mistress would be at
LINE 390: a loss how to deal with so unexpected a situation. He did indeed find
LINE 391: her in the last extremity of bashfulness and embarrassment, but under
LINE 392: the circumstances that, thought Genji, was natural. Much was to be
LINE 393: explained by the strict seclusion in which she had been brought up. He
LINE 394: must be patient with her....
LINE 395: As his eyes grew used to the dim light he began to see that she was
LINE 396: not at all beautiful. Had she then not one quality at all to justify
LINE 397: all these hopes and schemes? Apparently not one. It was late. What was
LINE 398: the use of staying? Bitterly disappointed he left the house. Myōbu,
LINE 399: intensely curious to know what would happen, had lain awake listening.
LINE 400: She wanted however to keep up the pretence that she had not witnessed
LINE 401: Genji's intrusion and though she plainly heard him leaving the house
LINE 402: she did not go to see him off or utter a sound of any kind. Stealing
LINE 403: away as quietly as possible he returned to the Nijō-in and lay down
LINE 404: upon his bed. This time at least he thought he was on the right path.
LINE 405: What a disillusionment! And the worst of it was that she was a
LINE 406: princess, a great lady. What a mess he was in! So he lay thinking,
LINE 407: when Tō no Chūjō entered the room. 'How late you are!' he cried; 'I
LINE 408: can easily guess the reason.' Genji rose: 'I was so comfortable
LINE 409: sleeping here all alone that I overslept myself,' he said. 'Have you
LINE 410: come here from the Palace?' 'Yes,' said Chūjō, 'I was on my way home.
LINE 411: I heard yesterday that to-day they are choosing the dancers and
LINE 412: musicians for the celebrations of the Emperor's visit to the Suzaku-in
LINE 413: and I am going home to tell my father of this. I will look in here on
LINE 414: my way back.' Seeing that Chūjō was in a hurry Genji said that he
LINE 415: would go with him to the Great Hall. He sent at once for his
LINE 416: breakfast, bidding them also serve the guest. Two carriages were drawn
LINE 417: up waiting for them, but they both got into the same one. 'You still
LINE 418: seem very sleepy,' said Chūjō in an aggrieved tone; 'I am sure you
LINE 419: have been doing something interesting that you do not want to tell me
LINE 420: about.'
LINE 421: That day he had a number of important duties to perform and was hard
LINE 422: at work in the Palace till nightfall. It did not occur to him till a
LINE 423: very late hour that he ought at least to send the customary letter. It
LINE 424: was raining. Myōbu had only the day before reproached him for using
LINE 425: the princess's palace as a 'wayside refuge.' To-day however he had no
LINE 426: inclination whatever to halt there.
LINE 427: When hour after hour went by and still no letter came Myōbu began to
LINE 428: feel very sorry for the princess whom she imagined to be suffering
LINE 429: acutely from Genji's incivility. But in reality the poor lady was
LINE 430: still far too occupied with shame and horror at what had happened the
LINE 431: night before to think of anything else, and when late in the evening
LINE 432: Genji's note at last arrived she could not understand in the least
LINE 433: what it meant. It began with the poem: 'Scarce had the evening mist
LINE 434: lifted and revealed the prospect to my sight when the night rain
LINE 435: closed gloomily about me.' 'I shall watch with impatience for a sign
LINE 436: that the clouds are breaking,' the letter continued. The ladies of the
LINE 437: household at once saw with consternation the meaning of this note:
LINE 438: Genji did not intend ever to come again. But they were all agreed that
LINE 439: an answer must be sent, and their mistress was for the time being in
LINE 440: far too overwrought a condition to put brush to paper; so Jijū
LINE 441: (pointing out that it was late and there was no time to be lost) again
LINE 442: came to the rescue: 'Give a thought to the country folk who wait for
LINE 443: moonlight on this cloudy night, though, while they gaze, so different
LINE 444: their thoughts from yours!' This she dictated to her mistress
LINE 445: who, under the joint direction of all her ladies, wrote it upon a
LINE 446: piece of paper which had once been purple but was now faded and
LINE 447: shabby. Her writing was coarse and stiff, very mediocre in style, the
LINE 448: upward and downward strokes being of the same thickness. Genji laid it
LINE 449: aside scarcely glancing at it; but he was very much worried by the
LINE 450: situation. How should he avoid hurting her feelings? Such an affair
LINE 451: was certain to get him into trouble of some kind. What was he to do?
LINE 452: He made up his mind that at all costs he must go on seeing her.
LINE 453: Meanwhile, knowing nothing of this decision, the poor lady was very
LINE 454: unhappy.
LINE 455: That night his father-in-law called for him on the way back from the
LINE 456: Palace and carried him off to the Great Hall.
LINE 457: Here in preparation for the coming festival all the young princes were
LINE 458: gathered together, and during the days which followed everyone was
LINE 459: busy practising the songs or dances which had been assigned to him.
LINE 460: Never had the Great Hall resounded with such a continual flow of
LINE 461: music. The recorder and the big flute were all the while in full
LINE 462: blast; and even the big drum was rolled out on to the verandah, the
LINE 463: younger princes amusing themselves by experimenting upon it. Genji was
LINE 464: so busy that he had barely time to pay an occasional surreptitious
LINE 465: visit even to his dearest friends, and the autumn passed without his
LINE 466: returning to the Hitachi Palace. The princess could not make it out.
LINE 467: Just at the time when the music-practices were at their height Myōbu
LINE 468: came to see him. Her account of the princess's condition was very
LINE 469: distressing. 'It is sad to witness day by day as I do how the poor
LINE 470: lady suffers from your unkind treatment,' she said and almost wept as
LINE 471: she told him about it. He was doubly embarrassed. What must Myōbu be
LINE 472: thinking of him since she found out that he had so recklessly
LINE 473: falsified all the assurances of good behaviour that she had made
LINE 474: on his account? And then the princess herself.... He could imagine
LINE 475: what a pathetic figure she must be, dumbly buried in her own
LINE 476: despondent thoughts and questionings. 'Please make it clear to her' he
LINE 477: said, 'that I have been extremely busy; that is really the sole reason
LINE 478: that I have not visited her.' But he added with a sigh 'I hope soon to
LINE 479: have a chance of teaching her not to be quite so stiff and shy.' He
LINE 480: smiled as he said it, and because he was so young and charming Myōbu
LINE 481: somehow felt that despite her indignation she must smile too. At his
LINE 482: age it was inevitable that he should cause a certain amount of
LINE 483: suffering. Suddenly it seemed to her perfectly right that he should do
LINE 484: as he felt inclined without thinking much about the consequences. When
LINE 485: the busy festival time was over he did indeed pay several visits to
LINE 486: the Hitachi Palace, but then followed his adoption of little Murasaki
LINE 487: whose ways so entranced him that he became very irregular even in his
LINE 488: visits to the Sixth Ward;[7] still less had he any inclination, though
LINE 489: he felt as sorry for the princess as ever, to visit that desolate
LINE 490: palace. For a long while he had no desire to probe the secret of her
LINE 491: bashfulness, to drive her into the light of day. But at last the idea
LINE 492: occurred to him that he had perhaps all the while been mistaken. It
LINE 493: was only a vague impression gathered in a room so dark that one could
LINE 494: hardly see one's hand in front of one's face. If only he could
LINE 495: persuade her to let him see her properly? But she seemed frightened to
LINE 496: submit herself to the ordeal of daylight. Accordingly one night when
LINE 497: he knew that he should catch her household quite at its ease he crept
LINE 498: in unobserved and peeped through a gap in the door of the women's
LINE 499: apartments. The princess herself was not visible. There was a very
LINE 500: dilapidated screen-of-honour at the end of the room, but it looked as
LINE 501: if it had not been moved from where it stood for years and years.
LINE 502: Four or five elderly gentlewomen were in the room. They were preparing
LINE 503: their mistress's supper in Chinese vessels which looked like the
LINE 504: famous 'royal blue' ware,[8] but they were much damaged and the food
LINE 505: which had been provided seemed quite unworthy of these precious
LINE 506: dishes. The old ladies soon retired, presumably to have their own
LINE 507: supper. In a closet opening out of the main road he could see a very
LINE 508: chilly-looking lady in an incredibly smoke-stained white dress and
LINE 509: dirty apron tied at the waist. Despite this shabbiness, her hair was
LINE 510: done over a comb in the manner of Court servants in ancient days when
LINE 511: they waited at their master's table, though it hung down untidily. He
LINE 512: had sometimes seen figures such as this haunting the housekeeper's
LINE 513: rooms in the Palace, but he had no idea that they could still actually
LINE 514: be seen waiting upon a living person! 'O dear, O dear,' cried the lady
LINE 515: in the apron, 'what a cold winter we are having! It was not worth
LINE 516: living so long only to meet times like these,' and she shed a tear.
LINE 517: 'If only things had but gone on as they were in the old Prince's
LINE 518: time!' she moaned. 'What a change! No discipline, no authority. To
LINE 519: think that I should have lived to see such days!' and she quivered
LINE 520: with horror like one who 'were he a bird would take wing and fly
LINE 521: away.'[9] She went on to pour out such a pitiful tale of things gone
LINE 522: awry that Genji could bear it no longer, and pretending that he had
LINE 523: just arrived tapped at the partition-door. With many exclamations of
LINE 524: surprise the old lady brought a candle and let him in. Unfortunately
LINE 525: Jijū had been chosen with other young persons to wait upon the Vestal
LINE 526: Virgin and was not at home. Her absence made the house seem more
LINE 527: rustic and old-fashioned than ever, and its oddity struck him even
LINE 528: more forcibly than before.
LINE 529: The melancholy snow was now falling faster and faster. Dark
LINE 530: clouds hung in the sky, the wind blew fierce and wild. The big lamp
LINE 531: had burnt out and it seemed to be no one's business to light it. He
LINE 532: remembered the terrible night upon which Yūgao had been bewitched. The
LINE 533: house indeed was almost as dilapidated. But it was not quite so large
LINE 534: and was (to Genji's comfort) at least to some small degree inhabited.
LINE 535: Nevertheless it was a depressing place to spend the night at in such
LINE 536: weather as this. Yet the snow-storm had a beauty and fascination of
LINE 537: its own and it was tiresome that the lady whom he had come to visit
LINE 538: was far too stiff and awkward to join him in appreciating its
LINE 539: wildness. The dawn was just breaking and lifting one of the shutters
LINE 540: with his own hand, he looked out at the snow-covered flower-beds.
LINE 541: Beyond them stretched great fields of snow untrodden by any foot. The
LINE 542: sight was very strange and lovely, and moved by the thought that he
LINE 543: must soon leave it: 'Come and look how beautiful it is out of doors,'
LINE 544: he cried to the princess who was in an inner room. 'It is unkind of
LINE 545: you always to treat me as though I were a stranger.' Although it was
LINE 546: still dark the light of the snow enabled the ancient gentlewomen who
LINE 547: had now returned to the room to see the freshness and beauty of
LINE 548: Genji's face. Gazing at him with undisguised wonder and delight, they
LINE 549: cried out to their mistress: 'Yes, madam, indeed you must come. You
LINE 550: are not behaving as you should. A young lady should be all kindness
LINE 551: and pretty ways.' Thus admonished, the princess who when told what to
LINE 552: do could never think of any reasons for not doing it, giving her
LINE 553: costume a touch here and there reluctantly crept into the front room.
LINE 554: Genji pretended to be still looking out of the window, but presently
LINE 555: he managed to glance back into the room. His first impression was that
LINE 556: her manner, had it been a little less diffident, would have been
LINE 557: extremely pleasing. What an absurd mistake he had made. She was
LINE 558: certainly very tall as was shown by the length of her back when
LINE 559: she took her seat; he could hardly believe that such a back could
LINE 560: belong to a woman. A moment afterwards he suddenly became aware of her
LINE 561: main defect. It was her nose. He could not help looking at it. It
LINE 562: reminded him of the trunk of Samantabhadra's[10] steed! Not only was
LINE 563: it amazingly prominent, but (strangest of all) the tip which drooped
LINE 564: downwards a little was tinged with pink, contrasting in the oddest
LINE 565: manner with the rest of her complexion which was of a whiteness that
LINE 566: would have put snow to shame. Her forehead was unusually high, so that
LINE 567: altogether (though this was partly concealed by the forward tilt of
LINE 568: her head) her face must be hugely long. She was very thin, her bones
LINE 569: showing in the most painful manner, particularly her shoulder-bones
LINE 570: which jutted out pitiably above her dress. He was sorry now that he
LINE 571: had exacted from her this distressing exhibition, but so extraordinary
LINE 572: a spectacle did she provide that he could not help continuing to gaze
LINE 573: upon her. In one point at least she yielded nothing to the greatest
LINE 574: beauties of the Capital. Her hair was magnificent; she was wearing it
LINE 575: loose and it hung a foot or more below the skirt of her gown. A
LINE 576: complete description of people's costumes is apt to be tedious, but as
LINE 577: in stories the first thing that is said about the characters is
LINE 578: invariably _what they wore_, I shall once in a way attempt such a
LINE 579: description. Over a terribly faded bodice of imperial purple she wore
LINE 580: a gown of which the purple had turned definitely black with age. Her
LINE 581: mantle was of sable-skins heavily perfumed with scent. Such a garment
LINE 582: as this mantle was considered very smart several generations ago, but
LINE 583: it struck him as the most extraordinary costume for a comparatively
LINE 584: young girl. However as a matter of fact she looked as though without
LINE 585: this monstrous wrapping she would perish with cold and he could
LINE 586: not help feeling sorry for her. As usual she seemed quite devoid of
LINE 587: conversation and her silence ended by depriving Genji also of the
LINE 588: power of speech. He felt however that he must try again to conquer her
LINE 589: religious muteness and began making a string of casual remarks.
LINE 590: Overcome with embarrassment she hid her face with her sleeve. This
LINE 591: attitude, together with her costume, reminded him so forcibly of queer
LINE 592: pompous old officials whom he had sometimes seen walking at funeral
LINE 593: pace in state processions, hugging their emblems of office to their
LINE 594: breasts, that he could not help laughing. This he felt to be very
LINE 595: rude. Really he was very sorry for her and longing to put a quick end
LINE 596: to her embarrassment he rose to go. 'Till I began to look after you
LINE 597: there was no one in whom you could possibly have confided. But
LINE 598: henceforward I think you must make up your mind to be frank with me
LINE 599: and tell me all your secrets. Your stern aloofness is very painful to
LINE 600: me,' and he recited the verse: 'Already the icicle that hangs from the
LINE 601: eaves is melting in the rays of the morning sun. How comes it that
LINE 602: these drippings to new ice should turn?' At this she tittered
LINE 603: slightly. Finding her inability to express herself quite unendurable
LINE 604: he left the house. Even in the dim light of early morning he noticed
LINE 605: that the courtyard gate at which his carriage awaited him was shaky on
LINE 606: its posts and much askew; daylight, he was sure, would have revealed
LINE 607: many other signs of dilapidation and neglect. In all the desolate
LINE 608: landscape which stretched monotonously before him under the bleak
LINE 609: light of dawn only the thick mantle of snow which covered the
LINE 610: pine-trees gave a note of comfort and almost of warmth.
LINE 611: Surely it was such a place as this, sombre as a little village in the
LINE 612: hills, that his friends had thought of on that rainy night when they
LINE 613: had spoken of the gate 'deep buried in green thickets.' If only there
LINE 614: were really hidden behind _these_ walls some such exquisite
LINE 615: creature as they had imagined. How patiently, how tenderly he would
LINE 616: court her! He longed for some experience which would bring him respite
LINE 617: from the anguish with which a certain hopeless and illicit passion was
LINE 618: at that time tormenting him. Alas, no one could have been less likely
LINE 619: to bring him the longed-for distraction than the owner of this
LINE 620: romantic mansion. Yet the very fact that she had nothing to recommend
LINE 621: her made it impossible for him to give her up, for it was certain that
LINE 622: no one else would ever take the trouble to visit her. But why, why had
LINE 623: it fallen to him of all people to become her intimate? Had the spirit
LINE 624: of the departed Prince Hitachi, unhappy at the girl's friendless
LINE 625: plight, chosen him out and led him to her?
LINE 626: At the side of the road he noticed a little orange-tree almost buried
LINE 627: in snow. He ordered one of his attendants to uncover it. As though
LINE 628: jealous of the attention that the man was paying to its neighbour a
LINE 629: pine-tree near by shook its heavily laden branches, pouring great
LINE 630: billows of snow over his sleeve. Delighted with the scene Genji
LINE 631: suddenly longed for some companion with whom he might share this
LINE 632: pleasure; not necessarily someone who loved such things as he did, but
LINE 633: one who at least responded to them in an ordinary way.
LINE 634: The gate through which his carriage had to pass in order to leave
LINE 635: the grounds was still locked. When at last the man who kept the key
LINE 636: had been discovered he turned out to be immensely old and feeble.
LINE 637: With him was a big, awkward girl who seemed to be his daughter or
LINE 638: grand-daughter. Her dress looked very grimy in contrast with the new
LINE 639: snow amid which she was standing. She seemed to be suffering very much
LINE 640: from the cold, for she was hugging a little brazier of some kind with
LINE 641: a stick or two of charcoal burning none too brightly in it. The old
LINE 642: man had not the strength to push back the door, and the girl was
LINE 643: dragging at it as well. Taking pity on them one of Genji's
LINE 644: servants went to their assistance and quickly opened it. Genji
LINE 645: remembered the poem in which Po Chü-i describes the sufferings of
LINE 646: villagers in wintry weather and he murmured the lines 'The little
LINE 647: children run naked in the cold; the aged shiver for lack of winter
LINE 648: clothes.' All at once he remembered the chilly appearance which that
LINE 649: unhappy bloom had given to the princess's face and he could not help
LINE 650: smiling. If ever he were able to show her to Tō no Chūjō, what strange
LINE 651: comparison, he wondered, would Chūjō use concerning it? He remembered
LINE 652: how Chūjō had followed him on the first occasion. Had he continued to
LINE 653: do so? Perhaps even at this minute he was under observation. The
LINE 654: thought irritated him.
LINE 655: Had her defects been less striking he could not possibly have
LINE 656: continued these distressing visits. But since he had actually seen her
LINE 657: in all her tragic uncouthness pity gained the upper hand, and
LINE 658: henceforward he kept in constant touch with her and showed her every
LINE 659: kindness. In the hope that she would abandon her sables he sent her
LINE 660: presents of silk, satin and quilted stuffs. He also sent thick cloth
LINE 661: such as old people wear, that the old man at the gate might be more
LINE 662: comfortably dressed. Indeed he sent presents to everyone on the estate
LINE 663: from the highest to the lowest. She did not seem to have any objection
LINE 664: to receiving these donations, which under the circumstances was very
LINE 665: convenient as it enabled him for the most part to limit their very
LINE 666: singular friendship to good offices of this kind.
LINE 667: Utsusemi too, he remembered, had seemed to him far from handsome when
LINE 668: he had peeped at her on the evening of her sudden flight. But she at
LINE 669: least knew how to behave and that saved her plainness from being
LINE 670: obtrusive. It was hard to believe that the princess belonged to a
LINE 671: class so far above that of Utsusemi. It only showed how little these
LINE 672: things have to do with birth or station. For in idle moments he
LINE 673: still regretted the loss of Utsusemi and it rankled in him yet that he
LINE 674: had in the end allowed her unyielding persistency to win the day.
LINE 675: And so the year drew to its close. One day when he was at his
LINE 676: apartments in the Emperor's Palace, Myōbu came to see him. He liked to
LINE 677: have her to do his hair and do small commissions for him. He was not
LINE 678: in the least in love with her; but they got on very well together and
LINE 679: he found her conversation so amusing that even when she had no duty to
LINE 680: perform at the Palace he encouraged her to come and see him whenever
LINE 681: she had any news. 'Something so absurd has happened' she said, 'that I
LINE 682: can hardly bring myself to tell you about it ...,' and she paused
LINE 683: smiling. 'I can hardly think,' answered Genji, 'that there can be
LINE 684: anything which you are frightened of telling to me.' 'If it were
LINE 685: connected with my own affairs,' she said, 'you know quite well that I
LINE 686: should tell you at once. But this is something quite different. I
LINE 687: really find it very hard to talk about.' For a long while he could get
LINE 688: nothing out of her, and only after he had scolded her for making so
LINE 689: unnecessary a fuss she at last handed him a letter. It was from the
LINE 690: princess. 'But this,' said Genji taking it, 'is the last thing in the
LINE 691: world that you could have any reason to hide from me.' She watched
LINE 692: with interest while he read it. It was written on thick paper drenched
LINE 693: with a strong perfume; the characters were bold and firm. With it was
LINE 694: a poem: 'Because of your hard heart, your hard heart only, the sleeves
LINE 695: of this my Chinese dress are drenched with tears.' The poem must, he
LINE 696: thought, refer to something not contained in the letter.
LINE 697: He was considering what this could be, when his eye fell on a clumsy,
LINE 698: old-fashioned clothes-box wrapped in a painted canvas cover. 'Now'
LINE 699: said Myōbu, 'perhaps you understand why I was feeling rather
LINE 700: uncomfortable. You may not believe it, but the princess means you to
LINE 701: wear this jacket on New Year's Day. I am afraid I cannot take it back
LINE 702: to her; that would be too unkind. But if you like I will keep it for
LINE 703: you and no one else shall see it. Only please, since it was to you
LINE 704: that she sent, just have one look at it before it goes away.' 'But I
LINE 705: should hate it to go away,' said Genji; 'I think it was so kind of her
LINE 706: to send it.' It was difficult to know what to say. Her poem was indeed
LINE 707: the most unpleasant jangle of syllables that he had ever encountered.
LINE 708: He now realized that the other poems must have been dictated to her,
LINE 709: perhaps by Jijū or one of the other ladies. And Jijū too it must
LINE 710: surely be who held the princess's brush and acted as writing-master.
LINE 711: When he considered what her utmost poetic endeavour would be likely to
LINE 712: produce he realized that these absurd verses were probably her
LINE 713: masterpiece and should be prized accordingly. He began to examine the
LINE 714: parcel; Myōbu blushed while she watched him. It was a plain,
LINE 715: old-fashioned, buff-coloured jacket of finely woven material, but
LINE 716: apparently not particularly well cut or stitched. It was indeed a
LINE 717: strange present, and spreading out her letter he wrote something
LINE 718: carelessly in the margin. When Myōbu looked over his shoulder she saw
LINE 719: that he had written the verse: 'How comes it that with my sleeve I
LINE 720: brushed this saffron-flower[11] that has no loveliness either of shape
LINE 721: or hue?'
LINE 722: What, wondered Myōbu, could be the meaning of this outburst against a
LINE 723: flower? At last turning over in her mind the various occasions when
LINE 724: Genji had visited the princess she remembered something[12] which she
LINE 725: had herself noticed one moonlit night, and though she felt the joke
LINE 726: was rather unkind, she could not help being amused. With practised
LINE 727: ease she threw out a verse in which she warned him that in the
LINE 728: eyes of a censorious world even this half-whimsical courtship might
LINE 729: fatally damage his good name. Her impromptu poem was certainly faulty;
LINE 730: but Genji reflected that if the poor princess had even Myōbu's very
LINE 731: ordinary degree of alertness it would make things much easier; and it
LINE 732: was quite true that to tamper with a lady of such high rank was not
LINE 733: very safe.
LINE 734: At this point visitors began to arrive. 'Please put this somewhere out
LINE 735: of sight,' said Genji pointing to the jacket; 'could one have believed
LINE 736: that it was possible to be presented with such an object?' and he
LINE 737: groaned. 'Oh why ever did I show it to him?' thought Myōbu. 'The only
LINE 738: result is that now he will be angry with me as well as with the
LINE 739: princess,' and in very low spirits she slipped out of his apartments.
LINE 740: Next day she was in attendance upon the Emperor and while she was
LINE 741: waiting with other gentlewomen in the ladies' common-room Genji came
LINE 742: up saying: 'Here you are. The answer to yesterday's letter. I am
LINE 743: afraid it is rather far-fetched,' and he flung a note to her. The
LINE 744: curiosity of the other gentlewomen was violently aroused. Genji left
LINE 745: the room humming 'The Lady of Mikasa Hill,'[13] which naturally amused
LINE 746: Myōbu very much. The other ladies wanted to know why the prince was
LINE 747: laughing to himself. Was there some joke...? 'Oh, no,' said Myōbu; 'I
LINE 748: think it was only that he had noticed someone whose nose was a little
LINE 749: red with the morning cold. The song he hummed was surely very
LINE 750: appropriate.' 'I think it was very silly,' said one of the ladies.
LINE 751: 'There is no one here to-day with a red nose. He must be thinking of
LINE 752: Lady Sakon or Higo no Uneme.' They were completely mystified. When
LINE 753: Myōbu presented Genji's reply, the ladies of the Hitachi Palace
LINE 754: gathered round her to admire it. It was written negligently on plain
LINE 755: white paper but was none the less very elegant. 'Does your gift of a
LINE 756: garment mean that you wish a greater distance than ever to be kept
LINE 757: between us?'[14]
LINE 758: On the evening of the last day of the year he sent back the box which
LINE 759: had contained his jacket, putting into it a court dress which had
LINE 760: formerly been presented to him, a dress of woven stuff dyed
LINE 761: grape-colour and various stuffs of yellow-rose colour and the like.
LINE 762: The box was brought by Myōbu. The princess's ancient gentlewomen
LINE 763: realized that Genji did not approve of their mistress's taste in
LINE 764: colours and wished to give her a lesson. 'Yes,' they said grudgingly,
LINE 765: 'that's a fine deep red while its new, but just think how it will
LINE 766: fade. And in Madam's poem too, I am sure, there was much more good
LINE 767: sense. In his answer he only tries to be smart.' The princess shared
LINE 768: their good opinion of her poem. It had cost her a great deal of effort
LINE 769: and before she sent it she had been careful to copy it into her
LINE 770: note-book.
LINE 771: Then came the New Year's Day celebrations; and this year there was
LINE 772: also to be the New Year's mumming, a band of young noblemen going
LINE 773: round dancing and singing in various parts of the Palace. After the
LINE 774: festival of the White Horse on the seventh day Genji left the
LINE 775: Emperor's presence at nightfall and went to his own apartments in the
LINE 776: Palace as though intending to stay the night there. But later he
LINE 777: adjourned to the Hitachi Palace which had on this occasion a less
LINE 778: forbidding appearance than usual. Even the princess was rather more
LINE 779: ordinary and amenable. He was hoping that like the season she too had
LINE 780: begun anew, when he saw that sunlight was coming into the room. After
LINE 781: hesitating for a while, he got up and went out into the front room. The
LINE 782: double doors at the end of the eastern wing were wide open, and
LINE 783: the roof of the verandah having fallen in, the sunshine poured
LINE 784: straight into the house. A little snow was still falling and its
LINE 785: brightness made the morning light yet more exquisitely brilliant and
LINE 786: sparkling. She watched a servant helping him into his cloak. She was
LINE 787: lying half out of the bed, her head hanging a little downwards and her
LINE 788: hair falling in great waves to the floor. Pleased with the sight he
LINE 789: began to wonder whether she would not one day outgrow her plainness.
LINE 790: He began to close the door of the women's apartments, but suddenly
LINE 791: feeling that he owed her amends for the harsh opinion of her
LINE 792: appearance which he had formed before, he did not quite shut the door,
LINE 793: but bringing a low stool towards it sat there putting his disordered
LINE 794: head-dress to rights. One of the maids brought him an incredibly
LINE 795: battered mirror-stand, Chinese combs, a box of toilet articles and
LINE 796: other things. It amused him to discover that in this household of
LINE 797: women a little male gear still survived, even in so decrepit a state.
LINE 798: He noticed that the princess, who was now up and dressed, was looking
LINE 799: quite fashionable. She was in fact wearing the clothes which he had
LINE 800: sent her before the New Year, but he did not at first recognize them.
LINE 801: He began however to have a vague idea that her mantle, with its rather
LINE 802: conspicuous pattern, was very like one of the things he had given her.
LINE 803: 'I do hope,' he said presently, 'that this year you will be a little
LINE 804: more conversational. I await the day when you will unbend a little
LINE 805: towards me more eagerly than the poet longs for the first nightingale.
LINE 806: If only like the year that has changed you too would begin anew!' Her
LINE 807: face brightened. She had thought of a remark and trembling from head
LINE 808: to foot with a tremendous effort she brought out the quotation 'When
LINE 809: plovers chirp and all things grow anew.' 'Splendid,' said Genji, 'This
LINE 810: is a sign that the new year has indeed begun' and smiling
LINE 811: encouragingly at her he left the house, she following him with her
LINE 812: eyes from the couch on which she lay. Her face as usual was half
LINE 813: covered by her arm; but the unfortunate flower still bloomed
LINE 814: conspicuously. 'Poor thing, she really _is_ very ugly,' thought Genji
LINE 815: in despair.
LINE 816: When he returned to the Nijō-in he found Murasaki waiting for him. She
LINE 817: was growing up as handsome a girl as one could wish, and promised well
LINE 818: for the future. She was wearing a plain close-fitting dress of cherry
LINE 819: colour; above all, the unstudied grace and ease of her movements
LINE 820: charmed and delighted him as he watched her come to meet him. In
LINE 821: accordance with the wishes of her old-fashioned grandmother her teeth
LINE 822: were not blackened, but her eyebrows were delicately touched with
LINE 823: stain. 'Why, when I might be playing with a beautiful child, do I
LINE 824: spend my time with an ugly woman? 'Genji kept on asking himself in
LINE 825: bewilderment while they sat together playing with her dolls. Next she
LINE 826: began to draw pictures and colour them. After she had painted all
LINE 827: sorts of queer and amusing things, 'Now I am going to do a picture for
LINE 828: you,' said Genji and drawing a lady with very long hair he put a dab
LINE 829: of red on her nose. Even in a picture, he thought pausing to look at
LINE 830: the effect, it gave one a most uncomfortable feeling. He went and
LINE 831: looked at himself in the mirror and as though dissatisfied with his
LINE 832: own fresh complexion he suddenly put on his own nose a dab of red such
LINE 833: as he had given to the lady in the picture. He looked at himself in
LINE 834: the mirror. His handsome face had in an instant become ridiculous and
LINE 835: repulsive. At first the child laughed. 'Should you go on liking me if
LINE 836: I were always as ugly as this?' he asked. Suddenly she began to be
LINE 837: afraid that the paint would not come off. 'Oh why did you do it?' she
LINE 838: cried. 'How horrible!' He pretended to rub it without effect. 'No,' he
LINE 839: said ruefully, 'it will not come off. What a sad end to our game! I
LINE 840: wonder what the Emperor will say when I go back to the Palace?'
LINE 841: He said it so seriously that she became very unhappy, and longing to
LINE 842: cure him dipped a piece of thick soft paper in the water-jug which
LINE 843: stood by his writing-things, and began scrubbing at his nose. 'Take
LINE 844: care,' he cried laughing, 'that you do not serve me as Heichū[15] was
LINE 845: treated by his lady. I would rather have a red nose than a black one.'
LINE 846: So they passed their time, making the prettiest couple.
LINE 847: In the gentle spring sunshine the trees were already shimmering with a
LINE 848: haze of new-grown buds. Among them it was the plum-trees that gave the
LINE 849: surest promise, for already their blossoms were uncurling, like lips
LINE 850: parted in a faint smile. Earliest of them all was a red plum that grew
LINE 851: beside the covered steps. It was in full colour. 'Though fair the tree
LINE 852: on which it blooms, this red flower fills me with a strange
LINE 853: misgiving,'[16] sang Genji with a deep sigh.
LINE 854: We shall see in the next chapter what happened in the end to all these
LINE 855: people.
LINE 856: [1] The events of this chapter are synchronous with those of the last.
LINE 857: [2] Wine, zithern and song—in allusion to a poem by Po Chü-i.
LINE 858: [3] Evidently a quotation.
LINE 859: [4] Chūjō's child by Yūgao.
LINE 860: [5] Used to scent clothes with.
LINE 861: [6] The bell which the Zen-master strikes when it is time for his pupils
LINE 862: to fall into silent meditation.
LINE 863: [7] To Lady Rokujō.
LINE 864: [8] _Pi-sē_. See Hetherington, _Early Ceramic Wares of China_,
LINE 865: pp. 71–73.
LINE 866: [9] _Manyōshū_, 893.
LINE 867: [10]The Bodhisattva Samantabhadra rides on a white elephant with a red
LINE 868: trunk.
LINE 869: [11] _Suyetsumuhana_, by which name, the princess is subsequently
LINE 870: alluded to in the story.
LINE 871: [12] I.e. the redness of the princess's nose.
LINE 872: [13] A popular song about a lady who suffered from the same defect as
LINE 873: the princess.
LINE 874: [14] Genji's poem is an allusion to a well-known _uta_ which runs:
LINE 875: 'Must we who once would not allow even the thickness of a garment to
LINE 876: part us be now far from each other for whole nights on end?'
LINE 877: [15] He used to splash his cheeks with water from a little bottle in
LINE 878: order that she might think he was weeping at her unkindness. She
LINE 879: exposed this device by mixing ink with the water.
LINE 880: [16] The reference of course is to the princess. 'Though fair the
LINE 881: tree' refers to her high birth.
