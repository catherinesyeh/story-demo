LINE 1: At the Court of an Emperor (he lived it matters not when) there was
LINE 2: among the many gentlewomen of the Wardrobe and Chamber one, who though
LINE 3: she was not of very high rank was favoured far beyond all the rest; so
LINE 4: that the great ladies of the Palace, each of whom had secretly hoped
LINE 5: that she herself would be chosen, looked with scorn and hatred upon
LINE 6: the upstart who had dispelled their dreams. Still less were her former
LINE 7: companions, the minor ladies of the Wardrobe, content to see her
LINE 8: raised so far above them. Thus her position at Court, preponderant
LINE 9: though it was, exposed her to constant jealousy and ill will; and
LINE 10: soon, worn out with petty vexations, she fell into a decline, growing
LINE 11: very melancholy and retiring frequently to her home. But the Emperor,
LINE 12: so far from wearying of her now that she was no longer well or gay,
LINE 13: grew every day more tender, and paid not the smallest heed to those
LINE 14: who reproved him, till his conduct became the talk of all the land;
LINE 15: and even his own barons and courtiers began to look askance at an
LINE 16: attachment so ill-advised. They whispered among themselves that in the
LINE 17: Land Beyond the Sea such happenings had led to riot and disaster.
LINE 18: The people of the country did indeed soon have many grievances to
LINE 19: show: and some likened her to Yang Kuei-fei, the mistress of Ming
LINE 20: Huang.[2] Yet, for all this discontent, so great was the sheltering
LINE 21: power of her master's love that none dared openly molest her.
LINE 22: Her father, who had been a Councillor, was dead. Her mother, who never
LINE 23: forgot that the father was in his day a man of some consequence,
LINE 24: managed despite all difficulties to give her as good an upbringing as
LINE 25: generally falls to the lot of young ladies whose parents are alive and
LINE 26: at the height of fortune. It would have helped matters greatly if
LINE 27: there had been some influential guardian to busy himself on the
LINE 28: child's behalf. Unfortunately, the mother was entirely alone in the
LINE 29: world and sometimes, when troubles came, she felt very bitterly the
LINE 30: lack of anyone to whom she could turn for comfort and advice. But to
LINE 31: return to the daughter. In due time she bore him a little Prince who,
LINE 32: perhaps because in some previous life a close bond had joined them,
LINE 33: turned out as fine and likely a man-child as well might be in all the
LINE 34: land. The Emperor could hardly contain himself during the days of
LINE 35: waiting.[3] But when, at the earliest possible moment, the child was
LINE 36: presented at Court, he saw that rumour had not exaggerated its beauty.
LINE 37: His eldest born prince was the son of Lady Kōkiden, the daughter of
LINE 38: the Minister of the Right, and this child was treated by all with the
LINE 39: respect due to an undoubted Heir Apparent. But he was not so fine a
LINE 40: child as the new prince; moreover the Emperor's great affection for
LINE 41: the new child's mother made him feel the boy to be in a peculiar sense
LINE 42: his own possession. Unfortunately she was not of the same rank as the
LINE 43: courtiers who waited upon him in the Upper Palace, so that despite
LINE 44: his love for her, and though she wore all the airs of a great lady, it
LINE 45: was not without considerable qualms that he now made it his practice
LINE 46: to have her by him not only when there was to be some entertainment,
LINE 47: but even when any business of importance was afoot. Sometimes indeed
LINE 48: he would keep her when he woke in the morning, not letting her go back
LINE 49: to her lodging, so that willy-nilly she acted the part of a
LINE 50: Lady-in-Perpetual-Attendance.
LINE 51: Seeing all this, Lady Kōkiden began to fear that the new prince, for
LINE 52: whom the Emperor seemed to have so marked a preference, would if she
LINE 53: did not take care soon be promoted to the Eastern Palace.[4] But she
LINE 54: had, after all, priority over her rival; the Emperor had loved her
LINE 55: devotedly and she had born him princes. It was even now chiefly the
LINE 56: fear of her reproaches that made him uneasy about his new way of life.
LINE 57: Thus, though his mistress could be sure of his protection, there were
LINE 58: many who sought to humiliate her, and she felt so weak in herself that
LINE 59: it seemed to her at last as though all the honours heaped upon her had
LINE 60: brought with them terror rather than joy.
LINE 61: Her lodging was in the wing called Kiritsubo. It was but natural that
LINE 62: the many ladies whose doors she had to pass on her repeated journeys
LINE 63: to the Emperor's room should have grown exasperated; and sometimes,
LINE 64: when these comings and goings became frequent beyond measure, it would
LINE 65: happen that on bridges and in corridors, here or there along the way
LINE 66: that she must go, strange tricks were played to frighten her or
LINE 67: unpleasant things were left lying about which spoiled the dresses of
LINE 68: the ladies who accompanied her.[5] Once indeed some one locked the
LINE 69: door of a portico, so that the poor thing wandered this way and
LINE 70: that for a great while in sore distress. So many were the miseries
LINE 71: into which this state of affairs now daily brought her that the
LINE 72: Emperor could no longer endure to witness her vexations and moved her
LINE 73: to the Kōrōden. In order to make room for her he was obliged to shift
LINE 74: the Chief Lady of the Wardrobe to lodgings outside. So far from
LINE 75: improving matters he had merely procured her a new and most embittered
LINE 76: enemy!
LINE 77: The young prince was now three years old. The Putting on of the
LINE 78: Trousers was performed with as much ceremony as in the case of the
LINE 79: Heir Apparent. Marvellous gifts flowed from the Imperial Treasury and
LINE 80: Tribute House. This too incurred the censure of many, but brought no
LINE 81: enmity to the child himself; for his growing beauty and the charm of
LINE 82: his disposition were a wonder and delight to all who met him. Indeed
LINE 83: many persons of ripe experience confessed themselves astounded that
LINE 84: such a creature should actually have been born in these latter and
LINE 85: degenerate days.
LINE 86: In the summer of that year the lady became very downcast. She
LINE 87: repeatedly asked for leave to go to her home, but it was not granted.
LINE 88: For a year she continued in the same state. The Emperor to all her
LINE 89: entreaties answered only 'Try for a little while longer.' But she was
LINE 90: getting worse every day, and when for five or six days she had been
LINE 91: growing steadily weaker her mother sent to the Palace a tearful plea
LINE 92: for her release. Fearing even now that her enemies might contrive to
LINE 93: put some unimaginable shame upon her, the sick lady left her son
LINE 94: behind and prepared to quit the Palace in secret. The Emperor knew
LINE 95: that the time had come when, little as he liked it, he must let her
LINE 96: go. But that she should slip away without a word of farewell was more
LINE 97: than he could bear, and he hastened to her side. He found her
LINE 98: still charming and beautiful, but her face very thin and wan. She
LINE 99: looked at him tenderly, saying nothing. Was she alive? So faint was
LINE 100: the dwindling spark that she scarcely seemed so. Suddenly forgetting
LINE 101: all that had happened and all that was to come, he called her by a
LINE 102: hundred pretty names and weeping showered upon her a thousand
LINE 103: caresses; but she made no answer. For sounds and sights reached her
LINE 104: but faintly, and she seemed dazed, as one that scarcely remembered she
LINE 105: lay upon a bed. Seeing her thus he knew not what to do. In great
LINE 106: trouble and perplexity he sent for a hand litter. But when they would
LINE 107: have laid her in it, he forbad them, saying 'There was an oath between
LINE 108: us that neither should go alone upon the road that all at last must
LINE 109: tread. How can I now let her go from me?' The lady heard him and 'At
LINE 110: last!' she said; 'Though that desired _at last_ be come, because I go
LINE 111: alone how gladly would I live!'
LINE 112: Thus with faint voice and failing breath she whispered. But though she
LINE 113: had found strength to speak, each word was uttered with great toil and
LINE 114: pain. Come what might, the Emperor would have watched by her till the
LINE 115: end, but that the priests who were to read the Intercession had
LINE 116: already been dispatched to her home. She must be brought there before
LINE 117: nightfall, and at last he forced himself to let the bearers carry her
LINE 118: away. He tried to sleep but felt stifled and could not close his eyes.
LINE 119: All night long messengers were coming and going between her home and
LINE 120: the Palace. From the first they brought no good news, and soon after
LINE 121: midnight announced that this time on arriving at the house they had
LINE 122: heard a noise of wailing and lamentation, and learned from those
LINE 123: within that the lady had just breathed her last. The Emperor lay
LINE 124: motionless as though he had not understood.
LINE 125: Though his father was so fond of his company, it was thought better
LINE 126: after this event that the Prince should go away from the Palace. He
LINE 127: did not understand what had happened, but seeing the servants all
LINE 128: wringing their hands and the Emperor himself continually weeping, he
LINE 129: felt that it must have been something very terrible. He knew that even
LINE 130: quite ordinary separations made people unhappy; but here was such a
LINE 131: dismal wailing and lamenting as he had never seen before, and he
LINE 132: concluded that this must be some very extraordinary kind of parting.
LINE 133: When the time came for the funeral to begin, the girl's mother cried
LINE 134: out that the smoke of her own body would be seen rising beside the
LINE 135: smoke of her child's bier. She rode in the same coach with the Court
LINE 136: ladies who had come to the funeral. The ceremony took place at Atago
LINE 137: and was celebrated with great splendour. So overpowering was the
LINE 138: mother's affection that so long as she looked on the body she still
LINE 139: thought of her child as alive. It was only when they lighted the pyre
LINE 140: she suddenly realized that what lay upon it was a corpse. Then, though
LINE 141: she tried to speak sensibly, she reeled and almost fell from the
LINE 142: coach, and those with her turned to one another and said 'At last she
LINE 143: knows.'
LINE 144: A herald came from the palace and read a proclamation which promoted
LINE 145: the dead lady to the Third Rank. The reading of this long proclamation
LINE 146: by the bier was a sad business. The Emperor repented bitterly that he
LINE 147: had not long ago made her a Lady-in-Waiting, and that was why he now
LINE 148: raised her rank by one degree. There were many who grudged her even
LINE 149: this honour; but some less stubborn began now to recall that she had
LINE 150: indeed been a lady of uncommon beauty; and others, that she had very
LINE 151: gentle and pleasing manners; while some went so far as to say it was a
LINE 152: shame that anybody should have disliked so sweet a lady, and that
LINE 153: if she had not been singled out unfairly from the rest, no one would
LINE 154: have said a word against her.
LINE 155: The seven weeks of mourning were, by the Emperor's order, minutely
LINE 156: observed. Time passed, but he still lived in rigid seclusion from the
LINE 157: ladies of the Court. The servants who waited upon him had a sad life,
LINE 158: for he wept almost without ceasing both day and night.
LINE 159: Kōkiden and the other great ladies were still relentless, and went
LINE 160: about saying 'it looked as though the Emperor would be no less
LINE 161: foolishly obsessed by her memory than he had been by her person.' He
LINE 162: did indeed sometimes see Kōkiden's son, the first-born prince. But
LINE 163: this only made him long the more to see the dead lady's child, and he
LINE 164: was always sending trusted servants, such as his own old nurse, to
LINE 165: report to him upon the boy's progress. The time of the autumn equinox
LINE 166: had come. Already the touch of the evening air was cold upon the skin.
LINE 167: So many memories crowded upon him that he sent a girl, the daughter of
LINE 168: his quiver-bearer, with a letter to the dead lady's house. It was
LINE 169: beautiful moonlit weather, and after he had despatched the messenger
LINE 170: he lingered for a while gazing out into the night. It was at such
LINE 171: times as this that he had been wont to call for music. He remembered
LINE 172: how her words, lightly whispered, had blended with those strangely
LINE 173: fashioned harmonies, remembered how all was strange, her face, her
LINE 174: air, her form. He thought of the poem which says that 'real things in
LINE 175: the darkness seem no realer than dreams' and he longed for even so dim
LINE 176: a substance as the dream-life of those nights.
LINE 177: The messenger had reached the gates of the house. She pushed them back
LINE 178: and a strange sight met her eyes. The old lady had for long been a
LINE 179: widow and the whole charge of keeping the domain in repair had fallen
LINE 180: upon her daughter. But since her death the mother, sunk in age and
LINE 181: despair, had done nothing to the place, and everywhere the weeds
LINE 182: grew high; and to all this desolation was added the wildness of the
LINE 183: autumn gale. Great clumps of mugwort grew so thick that only the
LINE 184: moonlight could penetrate them. The messenger alighted at the entrance
LINE 185: of the house. At first the mother could find no words with which to
LINE 186: greet her, but soon she said: 'Alas, I have lingered too long in the
LINE 187: world! I cannot bear to think that so fine a messenger as you have
LINE 188: pressed your way through the dewy thickets that bar the road to my
LINE 189: house,' and she burst into uncontrollable weeping. Then the
LINE 190: quiver-bearer's daughter said 'One of the Palace maids who came here,
LINE 191: told his Majesty that her heart had been torn with pity at what she
LINE 192: saw. And I, Madam, am in like case.' Then after a little hesitation
LINE 193: she repeated the Emperor's message: "For a while I searched in the
LINE 194: darkness of my mind, groping for an exit from my dream; but after long
LINE 195: pondering I can find no way to wake. There is none here to counsel me.
LINE 196: Will you not come to me secretly? It is not well that the young prince
LINE 197: should spend his days in so desolate and sad a place. Let him come
LINE 198: too!" This he said and much else, but confusedly and with many sighs;
LINE 199: and I, seeing that the struggle to hide his grief from me was costing
LINE 200: him dear, hurried away from the Palace without hearing all. But here
LINE 201: is a letter that he sent.'
LINE 202: 'My sight is dim' said the mother. 'Let me hold His letter to the
LINE 203: light.' The letter said:
LINE 204: 'I had thought that after a while there might be some blurring, some
LINE 205: slight effacement. But no. As days and months go by, the more
LINE 206: senseless, the more unendurable becomes my life. I am continually
LINE 207: thinking of the child, wondering how he fares. I had hoped that his
LINE 208: mother and I together would watch over his upbringing. Will you not
LINE 209: take her place in this, and bring him to me as a memory of the
LINE 210: past?' Such was the letter, and many instructions were added to it
LINE 211: together with a poem which said '_At the sound of the wind that binds
LINE 212: the cold dew on Takagi moor, my heart goes out to the tender lilac
LINE 213: stems_.'
LINE 214: It was of the young prince that he spoke in symbol; but she did not
LINE 215: read the letter to the end. At last the mother said 'Though I know
LINE 216: that long life means only bitterness, I have stayed so long in the
LINE 217: world that even before the Pine Tree of Takasago I should hide my head
LINE 218: in shame. How then should I find courage to go hither and thither in
LINE 219: the great Palace of a Hundred Towers? Though the august summons should
LINE 220: call me time and again, myself I could not obey. But the young prince
LINE 221: (whether he may have heard the august wish I know not) is impatient to
LINE 222: return, and, what is small wonder, seems very downcast in this place.
LINE 223: Tell his Majesty this, and whatever else of my thoughts you have here
LINE 224: learnt from me. For a little child this house is indeed a sorry
LINE 225: place....' 'They say that the child is asleep' the quiver-bearer's
LINE 226: daughter answered. 'I should like to have seen him and told the
LINE 227: Emperor how he looks; but I am awaited at the Palace and it must be
LINE 228: late.'
LINE 229: She was hastening away, but the mother: 'Since even those who wander
LINE 230: in the darkness of their own black thoughts can gain by converse a
LINE 231: momentary beam to guide their steps, I pray you sometimes to visit me
LINE 232: of your own accord and when you are at leisure. In years past it was
LINE 233: at times of joy and triumph that you came to this house, and now this
LINE 234: is the news you bring! Foolish are they indeed who trust to fortune!
LINE 235: From the time she was born until his death, her father, who knew his
LINE 236: own mind, would have it that she must go to Court and charged me again
LINE 237: and again not to disappoint his wishes if he were to die. And so,
LINE 238: though I thought that the lack of a guardian would bring her into
LINE 239: many difficulties, I was determined to carry out his desire. At Court
LINE 240: she found that favours only too great were to be hers, and all the
LINE 241: while must needs endure in secrecy the tokens of inhuman malice; till
LINE 242: hatred had heaped upon her so heavy a load of cares that she died as
LINE 243: it were murdered. Indeed, the love that in His wisdom He deigned to
LINE 244: show her (or so sometimes it seems to me in the uncomprehending
LINE 245: darkness of my heart) was crueller than indifference.'
LINE 246: So she spoke, till tears would let her speak no more; and now the
LINE 247: night had come.
LINE 248: 'All this' the girl answered 'He himself has said; and further: "That
LINE 249: thus against My will and judgment I yielded helplessly to a passion so
LINE 250: reckless that it caused men's eyes to blink was perhaps decreed for
LINE 251: the very reason that our time was fated to be so short; it was the
LINE 252: wild and vehement passion of those who are marked down for instant
LINE 253: separation. And though I had vowed that none should suffer because of
LINE 254: my love, yet in the end she bore upon her shoulders the heavy hatred
LINE 255: of many who thought that for her sake they had been wronged."
LINE 256: 'So again and again have I heard the Emperor speak with tears. But now
LINE 257: the night is far spent and I must carry my message to the Palace
LINE 258: before day comes.'
LINE 259: So she, weeping too, spoke as she hurried away. But the sinking moon
LINE 260: was shining in a cloudless sky, and in the grass-clumps that shivered
LINE 261: in the cold wind, bell-crickets tinkled their compelling cry. It was
LINE 262: hard to leave these grass-clumps, and the quiver-bearer's daughter,
LINE 263: loth to ride away, recited the poem which says 'Ceaseless as the
LINE 264: interminable voices of the bell-cricket, all night till dawn my tears
LINE 265: flow.' The mother answered 'Upon the thickets that teem with myriad
LINE 266: insect voices falls the dew of a Cloud Dweller's tears'; for the
LINE 267: people of the Court are called _dwellers above the clouds_. Then
LINE 268: she gave the messenger a sash, a comb and other things that the dead
LINE 269: lady had left in her keeping,—gifts from the Emperor which now, since
LINE 270: their use was gone, she sent back to him as mementoes of the past. The
LINE 271: nurse-maids who had come with the boy were depressed not so much at
LINE 272: their mistress's death as at being suddenly deprived of the daily
LINE 273: sights and sensations of the Palace. They begged to go back at once.
LINE 274: But the mother was determined not to go herself, knowing that she
LINE 275: would cut too forlorn a figure. On the other hand if she parted with
LINE 276: the boy, she would be daily in great anxiety about him. That was why
LINE 277: she did not immediately either go with him herself or send him to the
LINE 278: Palace.
LINE 279: The quiver-bearer's daughter found the Emperor still awake. He was,
LINE 280: upon pretext of visiting the flower-pots in front of the Palace which
LINE 281: were then in full bloom, waiting for her out of doors, while four or
LINE 282: five trusted ladies conversed with him.
LINE 283: At this time it was his wont to examine morning and evening a picture
LINE 284: of The Everlasting Wrong,[6] the text written by Teiji no In,[7] with
LINE 285: poems by Ise[8] and Tsurayuki,[9] both in Yamato speech, and in that
LINE 286: of the men beyond the sea, and the story of this poem was the common
LINE 287: matter of his talk.
LINE 288: Now he turned to the messenger and asked eagerly for all her news. And
LINE 289: when she had given him a secret and faithful account of the sad place
LINE 290: whence she had come, she handed him the mother's letter: 'His
LINE 291: Majesty's gracious commands I read with reverence deeper than I can
LINE 292: express, but their purport has brought great darkness and confusion
LINE 293: to my mind.' All this, together with a poem in which she compared
LINE 294: her grandchild to a flower which has lost the tree that sheltered it
LINE 295: from the great winds, was so wild and so ill-writ as only to be
LINE 296: suffered from the hand of one whose sorrow was as yet unhealed.
LINE 297: Again the Emperor strove for self-possession in the presence of his
LINE 298: messenger. But as he pictured to himself the time when the dead lady
LINE 299: first came to him, a thousand memories pressed thick about him, and
LINE 300: recollection linked to recollection carried him onward, till he
LINE 301: shuddered to think how utterly unmarked, unheeded all these hours and
LINE 302: days had fled.
LINE 303: At last he said 'I too thought much and with delight how with most
LINE 304: profit might be fulfilled the wish that her father the Councillor left
LINE 305: behind him; but of that no more. If the young Prince lives occasion
LINE 306: may yet be found.... It is for his long life that we must pray.'
LINE 307: He looked at the presents she had brought back and 'Would that like
LINE 308: the wizard you had brought a kingfisher-hairpin as token of your visit
LINE 309: to the place where her spirit dwells' he cried, and recited the poem:
LINE 310: _Oh for a master of magic who might go and seek her, and by a message
LINE 311: teach me where her spirit dwells_.
LINE 312: For the picture of Kuei-fei, skilful though the painter might be, was
LINE 313: but the work of a brush, and had no living fragrance. And though the
LINE 314: poet tells us that Kuei-fei's grace was as that of 'the hibiscus of
LINE 315: the Royal Lake or the willows of the Wei-yang Palace,' the lady in the
LINE 316: picture was all paint and powder and had a simpering Chinesified air.
LINE 317: But when he thought of the lost lady's voice and form, he could find
LINE 318: neither in the beauty of flowers nor in the song of birds any fit
LINE 319: comparison. Continually he pined that fate should not have allowed
LINE 320: them to fulfil the vow which morning and evening was ever talked of
LINE 321: between them,—the vow that their lives should be as the twin birds
LINE 322: that share a wing, the twin trees that share a bough. The rustling of
LINE 323: the wind, the chirping of an insect would cast him into the deepest
LINE 324: melancholy; and now Kōkiden, who for a long while had not been
LINE 325: admitted to his chamber, must needs sit in the moonlight making music
LINE 326: far on into the night! This evidently distressed him in the highest
LINE 327: degree and those ladies and courtiers who were with him were equally
LINE 328: shocked and distressed on his behalf. But the offending lady was one
LINE 329: who stood much upon her dignity and she was determined to behave as
LINE 330: though nothing of any consequence had taken place in the Palace.
LINE 331: And now the moon had set. The Emperor thought of the girl's mother in
LINE 332: the house amid the thickets and wondered, making a poem of the
LINE 333: thought, with what feelings she had watched the sinking of the autumn
LINE 334: moon: 'for even we Men above the Clouds were weeping when it sank.'
LINE 335: He raised the torches high in their sockets and still sat up. But at
LINE 336: last he heard voices coming from the Watch House of the Right and knew
LINE 337: that the hour of the Bull[10] had struck. Then, lest he should be
LINE 338: seen, he went into his chamber. He found he could not sleep and was up
LINE 339: before daybreak. But, as though he remembered the words 'he knew not
LINE 340: the dawn was at his window' of Ise's poem,[11] he showed little
LINE 341: attention to the affairs of his Morning Audience, scarcely touched his
LINE 342: dried rice and seemed but dimly aware of the viands on the great
LINE 343: Table, so that the carvers and waiting-men groaned to see their
LINE 344: Master's plight; and all his servants, both men and women kept on
LINE 345: whispering to one another 'What a senseless occupation has ours
LINE 346: become!' and supposed that he was obeying some extravagant vow.
LINE 347: Regardless of his subjects' murmurings, he continually allowed his
LINE 348: mind to wander from their affairs to his own, so that the scandal of
LINE 349: his negligence was now as dangerous to the State as it had been
LINE 350: before, and again there began to be whispered references to a certain
LINE 351: Emperor of another land. Thus the months and days passed, and in the
LINE 352: end the young prince arrived at Court. He had grown up to be a child
LINE 353: of unrivalled beauty and the Emperor was delighted with him. In the
LINE 354: spring an heir to the Throne was to be proclaimed and the Emperor was
LINE 355: sorely tempted to pass over the first-born prince in favour of the
LINE 356: young child. But there was no one at Court to support such a choice
LINE 357: and it was unlikely that it would be tolerated by the people; it would
LINE 358: indeed bring danger rather than glory to the child. So he carefully
LINE 359: concealed from the world that he had any such design, and gained great
LINE 360: credit, men saying 'Though he dotes on the boy, there is at least some
LINE 361: limit to his folly.' And even the great ladies of the Palace became a
LINE 362: little easier in their minds.
LINE 363: The grandmother remained inconsolable, and impatient to set out upon
LINE 364: her search for the place where the dead lady's spirit dwelt, she soon
LINE 365: expired. Again the Emperor was in great distress; and this time the
LINE 366: boy, being now six years old, understood what had happened and wept
LINE 367: bitterly. And often he spoke sadly of what he had seen when he was
LINE 368: brought to visit the poor dead lady who had for many years been so
LINE 369: kind to him. Henceforward he lived always at the Palace. When he
LINE 370: became seven he began to learn his letters, and his quickness was so
LINE 371: unusual that his father was amazed. Thinking that now no one would
LINE 372: have the heart to be unkind to the child, the Emperor began to take
LINE 373: him to the apartments of Kōkiden and the rest, saying to them 'Now
LINE 374: that his mother is dead I know that you will be nice to him.' Thus the
LINE 375: boy began to penetrate the Royal Curtain. The roughest soldier,
LINE 376: the bitterest foeman could not have looked on such a child without a
LINE 377: smile, and Kōkiden did not send him away. She had two daughters who
LINE 378: were indeed not such fine children as the little prince. He also
LINE 379: played with the Court Ladies, who, because he was now very pretty and
LINE 380: bashful in his ways, found endless amusement, as indeed did everyone
LINE 381: else, in sharing his games. As for his serious studies, he soon learnt
LINE 382: to send the sounds of zithern and flute flying gaily to the clouds.
LINE 383: But if I were to tell you of all his accomplishments, you would think
LINE 384: that he was soon going to become a bore.
LINE 385: At this time some Koreans came to Court and among them a
LINE 386: fortune-teller. Hearing this, the Emperor did not send for them to
LINE 387: come to the Palace, because of the law against the admission of
LINE 388: foreigners which was made by the Emperor Uda.[12] But in strict
LINE 389: secrecy he sent the Prince to the Strangers' quarters. He went under
LINE 390: the escort of the Secretary of the Right, who was to introduce him as
LINE 391: his own son. The fortune teller was astonished by the boy's lineaments
LINE 392: and expressed his surprise by continually nodding his head: 'He has
LINE 393: the marks of one who might become a Father of the State, and if this
LINE 394: were his fate, he would not stop short at any lesser degree than that
LINE 395: of Mighty King and Emperor of all the land. But when I look again—I
LINE 396: see that confusion and sorrow would attend his reign. But should he
LINE 397: become a great Officer of State and Counsellor of the Realm I see no
LINE 398: happy issue, for he would be defying those kingly signs of which I
LINE 399: spoke before.'
LINE 400: The Secretary was a most talented, wise and learned scholar, and now
LINE 401: began to conduct an interesting conversation with the fortune teller.
LINE 402: They exchanged essays and poems, and the fortune-teller made a
LINE 403: little speech, saying 'It has been a great pleasure to me on the eve
LINE 404: of my departure to meet with a man of capacities so unusual; and
LINE 405: though I regret my departure I shall now take away most agreeable
LINE 406: impressions of my visit.' The little prince presented him with a very
LINE 407: nice verse of poetry, at which he expressed boundless admiration and
LINE 408: offered the boy a number of handsome presents. In return the Emperor
LINE 409: sent him a large reward from the Imperial Treasury. This was all kept
LINE 410: strictly secret. But somehow or other the Heir Apparent's grandfather,
LINE 411: the Minister of the Right, and others of his party got wind of
LINE 412: it and became very suspicious. The Emperor then sent for native
LINE 413: fortune-tellers and made trial of them, explaining that because of
LINE 414: certain signs which he had himself observed he had hitherto refrained
LINE 415: from making the boy a prince. With one accord they agreed that he had
LINE 416: acted with great prudence and the Emperor determined not to set the
LINE 417: child adrift upon the world as a prince without royal standing or
LINE 418: influence upon the mother's side. For he thought 'My own power is very
LINE 419: insecure. I had best set him to watch on my behalf over the great
LINE 420: Officers of State.' Thinking that he had thus agreeably settled the
LINE 421: child's future, he set seriously to work upon his education, and saw
LINE 422: to it that he should be made perfect in every branch of art and
LINE 423: knowledge. He showed such aptitude in all his studies that it seemed a
LINE 424: pity he should remain a commoner and as it had been decided that it
LINE 425: would arouse suspicion if he were made a prince, the Emperor consulted
LINE 426: with certain doctors wise in the lore of the planets and phases of the
LINE 427: moon. And they with one accord recommended that he should be made a
LINE 428: Member of the Minamoto (or Gen) Clan. So this was done. As the years
LINE 429: went by the Emperor did not forget his lost lady; and though many
LINE 430: women were brought to the Palace in the hope that he might take
LINE 431: pleasure in them, he turned from them all, believing that there was
LINE 432: not in the world any one like her whom he had lost. There was at that
LINE 433: time a lady whose beauty was of great repute. She was the fourth
LINE 434: daughter of the previous Emperor, and it was said that her mother, the
LINE 435: Dowager Empress, had brought her up with unrivalled care. A certain
LINE 436: Dame of the Household, who had served the former Emperor, was
LINE 437: intimately acquainted with the young Princess, having known her since
LINE 438: childhood and still having occasion to observe her from without. 'I
LINE 439: have served in three courts' said the Dame 'and in all that time have
LINE 440: seen none who could be likened to the departed lady, save the daughter
LINE 441: of the Empress Mother. She indeed is a lady of rare beauty.' So she
LINE 442: spoke to the Emperor, and he, much wondering what truth there was in
LINE 443: it, listened with great attention. The Empress Mother heard of this
LINE 444: with great alarm, for she remembered with what open cruelty the
LINE 445: sinister Lady Kōkiden had treated her former rival, and though she did
LINE 446: not dare speak openly of her fears, she was managing to delay the
LINE 447: girl's presentation, when suddenly she died.
LINE 448: The Emperor, hearing that the bereaved Princess was in a very desolate
LINE 449: condition, sent word gently telling her that he should henceforward
LINE 450: look upon her as though she were one of the Lady Princesses his
LINE 451: daughters. Her servants and guardians and her brother, Prince
LINE 452: Hyōbukyō, thought that life in the Palace might distract her and would
LINE 453: at least be better than the gloomy desolation of her home, and so they
LINE 454: sent her to the Court. She lived in apartments called Fujitsubo
LINE 455: (Wistaria Tub) and was known by this name. The Emperor could not deny
LINE 456: that she bore an astonishing resemblance to his beloved. She was
LINE 457: however of much higher rank, so that everyone was anxious to please
LINE 458: her, and, whatever happened, they were prepared to grant her the
LINE 459: utmost licence: whereas the dead lady had been imperilled by the
LINE 460: Emperor's favour only because the Court was not willing to accept her.
LINE 461: His old love did not now grow dimmer, and though he sometimes found
LINE 462: solace and distraction in shifting his thoughts from the lady who had
LINE 463: died to the lady who was so much like her, yet life remained for him a
LINE 464: sad business.
LINE 465: Genji ('he of the Minamoto clan'), as he was now called, was
LINE 466: constantly at the Emperor's side. He was soon quite at his ease with
LINE 467: the common run of Ladies in Waiting and Ladies of the Wardrobe, so it
LINE 468: was not likely he would be shy with one who was daily summoned to the
LINE 469: Emperor's apartments. It was but natural that all these ladies should
LINE 470: vie eagerly with one another for the first place in Genji's
LINE 471: affections, and there were many whom in various ways he admired very
LINE 472: much. But most of them behaved in too grown-up a fashion; only one,
LINE 473: the new princess, was pretty and quite young as well, and though she
LINE 474: tried to hide from him, it was inevitable that they should often meet.
LINE 475: He could not remember his mother, but the Dame of the Household had
LINE 476: told him how very like to her the girl was, and this interested his
LINE 477: childish fancy, and he would like to have been her great friend and
LINE 478: lived with her always. One day the Emperor said to her 'Do not be
LINE 479: unkind to him. He is interested because he has heard that you are so
LINE 480: like his mother. Do not think him impertinent, but behave nicely to
LINE 481: him. You are indeed so like him in look and features that you might
LINE 482: well be his mother.'
LINE 483: And so, young though he was, fleeting beauty took its hold upon his
LINE 484: thoughts; he felt his first clear predilection.
LINE 485: Kōkiden had never loved this lady too well, and now her old enmity to
LINE 486: Genji sprang up again; her own children were reckoned to be of quite
LINE 487: uncommon beauty, but in this they were no match for Genji, who was so
LINE 488: lovely a boy that people called him Hikaru Genji or Genji the
LINE 489: Shining One; and Princess Fujitsubo, who also had many admirers, was
LINE 490: called Princess Glittering Sunshine.
LINE 491: Though it seemed a shame to put so lovely a child into man's dress, he
LINE 492: was now twelve years old and the time for his Initiation was come. The
LINE 493: Emperor directed the preparations with tireless zeal and insisted upon
LINE 494: a magnificence beyond what was prescribed. The Initiation of the Heir
LINE 495: Apparent, which had last year been celebrated in the Southern Hall,
LINE 496: was not a whit more splendid in its preparations. The ordering of the
LINE 497: banquets that were to be given in various quarters, and the work of
LINE 498: the Treasurer and Grain Intendant he supervised in person, fearing
LINE 499: lest the officials should be remiss; and in the end all was
LINE 500: perfection. The ceremony took place in the eastern wing of the
LINE 501: Emperor's own apartments, and the Throne was placed facing towards the
LINE 502: east, with the seats of the Initiate to-be and his Sponsor (the
LINE 503: Minister of the Left) in front.
LINE 504: Genji arrived at the hour of the Monkey.[13] He looked very handsome
LINE 505: with his long childish locks, and the Sponsor, whose duty it had just
LINE 506: been to bind them with the purple filet, was sorry to think that all
LINE 507: this would soon be changed and even the Clerk of the Treasury seemed
LINE 508: loath to sever those lovely tresses with the ritual knife. The
LINE 509: Emperor, as he watched, remembered for a moment what pride the mother
LINE 510: would have taken in the ceremony, but soon drove the weak thought from
LINE 511: his mind.
LINE 512: Duly crowned, Genji went to his chamber and changing into man's dress
LINE 513: went down into the courtyard and performed the Dance of Homage, which
LINE 514: he did with such grace that tears stood in every eye. And now the
LINE 515: Emperor, whose grief had of late grown somewhat less insistent, was
LINE 516: again overwhelmed by memories of the past.
LINE 517: It had been feared that his delicate features would show to less
LINE 518: advantage when he had put aside his childish dress; but on the
LINE 519: contrary he looked handsomer than ever.
LINE 520: His sponsor, the Minister of the Left, had an only daughter whose
LINE 521: beauty the Heir Apparent had noticed. But now the father began to
LINE 522: think he would not encourage that match, but would offer her to Genji.
LINE 523: He sounded the Emperor upon this, and found that he would be very glad
LINE 524: to obtain for the boy the advantage of so powerful a connection.
LINE 525: When the courtiers assembled to drink the Love Cup, Genji came and
LINE 526: took his place among the other princes. The Minister of the Left came
LINE 527: up and whispered something in his ear; but the boy blushed and could
LINE 528: think of no reply. A chamberlain now came over to the Minister and
LINE 529: brought him a summons to wait upon His Majesty immediately. When he
LINE 530: arrived before the Throne, a Lady of the Wardrobe handed to him the
LINE 531: Great White Inner Garment and the Maid's Skirt,[14] which were his
LINE 532: ritual due as Sponsor to the Prince. Then, when he had made him drink
LINE 533: out of the Royal Cup, the Emperor recited a poem in which he prayed
LINE 534: that the binding of the purple filet might symbolize the union of
LINE 535: their two houses; and the Minister answered him that nothing should
LINE 536: sever this union save the fading of the purple band. Then he descended
LINE 537: the long stairs and from the courtyard performed the Grand
LINE 538: Obeisance.[15] Here too were shown the horses from the Royal Stables
LINE 539: and the hawks from the Royal Falconry, that had been decreed as
LINE 540: presents for Genji. At the foot of the stairs the Princes and
LINE 541: Courtiers were lined up to receive their bounties, and gifts of every
LINE 542: kind were showered upon them. That day the hampers and fruit baskets
LINE 543: were distributed in accordance with the Emperor's directions by the
LINE 544: learned Secretary of the Right, and boxes of cake and presents lay
LINE 545: about so thick that one could scarcely move. Such profusion had not
LINE 546: been seen even at the Heir Apparent's Initiation.
LINE 547: That night Genji went to the Minister's house, where his betrothal was
LINE 548: celebrated with great splendour. It was thought that the little Prince
LINE 549: looked somewhat childish and delicate, but his beauty astonished
LINE 550: everyone. Only the bride, who was four years older, regarded him as a
LINE 551: mere baby and was rather ashamed of him.
LINE 552: The Emperor still demanded Genji's attendance at the Palace, so he did
LINE 553: not set up a house of his own. In his inmost heart he was always
LINE 554: thinking how much nicer _she_[16] was than anyone else, and only
LINE 555: wanted to be with people who were like her, but alas no one was the
LINE 556: least like her. Everyone seemed to make a great deal of fuss about
LINE 557: Princess Aoi, his betrothed; but he could see nothing nice about her.
LINE 558: The girl at the Palace now filled all his childish thoughts and this
LINE 559: obsession became a misery to him.
LINE 560: Now that he was a 'man' he could no longer frequent the women's
LINE 561: quarters as he had been wont to do. But sometimes when an
LINE 562: entertainment was a-foot he found comfort in hearing her voice dimly
LINE 563: blending with the sound of zithern or flute and felt his grown-up
LINE 564: existence to be unendurable. After an absence of five or six days he
LINE 565: would occasionally spend two or three at his betrothed's house. His
LINE 566: father-in-law attributing this negligence to his extreme youth was not
LINE 567: at all perturbed and always received him warmly. Whenever he came the
LINE 568: most interesting and agreeable of the young people of the day were
LINE 569: asked to meet him and endless trouble was taken in arranging games to
LINE 570: amuse him.
LINE 571: The Shigeisa, one of the rooms which had belonged to his mother, was
LINE 572: allotted to him as his official quarters in the Palace, and the
LINE 573: servants who had waited on her were now gathered together again and
LINE 574: formed his suite. His grandmother's house was falling into decay. The
LINE 575: Imperial Office of Works was ordered to repair it. The grouping of the
LINE 576: trees and disposition of the surrounding hills had always made the
LINE 577: place delightful. Now the basin of the lake was widened and many other
LINE 578: improvements were carried out. 'If only I were going to live here with
LINE 579: someone whom I liked,' thought Genji sadly.
LINE 580: Some say that the name of Hikaru the Shining One was given to him in
LINE 581: admiration by the Korean fortune-teller.[17]
