LINE 1: About the twentieth day of the second month the Emperor gave a Chinese
LINE 2: banquet under the great cherry-tree of the Southern Court. Both
LINE 3: Fujitsubo and the Heir Apparent were to be there. Kōkiden, although
LINE 4: she knew that the mere presence of the Empress was sufficient to spoil
LINE 5: her pleasure, could not bring herself to forego so delightful an
LINE 6: entertainment. After some promise of rain the day turned out
LINE 7: magnificent; and in full sunshine, with the birds singing in every
LINE 8: tree, the guests (royal princes, noblemen and professional poets
LINE 9: alike) were handed the rhyme words which the Emperor had drawn by lot,
LINE 10: and set to work to compose their poems. It was with a clear and
LINE 11: ringing voice that Genji read out the word 'Spring' which he had
LINE 12: received as the rhyme-sound of his poem. Next came Tō no Chūjō who,
LINE 13: feeling that all eyes were upon him and determined to impress himself
LINE 14: favourably on his audience, moved with the greatest possible elegance
LINE 15: and grace; and when on receiving his rhyme he announced his name,
LINE 16: rank, and titles, he took great pains to speak pleasantly as well as
LINE 17: audibly. Many of the other gentlemen were rather nervous and looked
LINE 18: quite pale as they came forward, yet they acquitted themselves well
LINE 19: enough. But the professional poets, particularly owing to the high
LINE 20: standard of accomplishment which the Emperor's and Heir Apparent's
LINE 21: lively interest in Chinese poetry had at that time diffused
LINE 22: through the Court, were very ill at ease; as they crossed the long
LINE 23: space of the garden on their way to receive their rhymes they felt
LINE 24: utterly helpless. A simple Chinese verse is surely not much to ask of
LINE 25: a professional poet; but they all wore an expression of the deepest
LINE 26: gloom. One expects elderly scholars to be somewhat odd in their
LINE 27: movements and behaviour, and it was amusing to see the lively concern
LINE 28: with which the Emperor watched their various but always uncouth and
LINE 29: erratic methods of approaching the Throne. Needless to say a great
LINE 30: deal of music had been arranged for. Towards dusk the delightful dance
LINE 31: known as the Warbling of Spring Nightingales was performed, and when
LINE 32: it was over the Heir Apparent, remembering the Festival of Red Leaves,
LINE 33: placed a wreath on Genji's head and pressed him so urgently that it
LINE 34: was impossible for him to refuse. Rising to his feet he danced very
LINE 35: quietly a fragment of the sleeve-turning passage in the Wave Dance. In
LINE 36: a few moments he was seated again, but even into this brief extract
LINE 37: from a long dance he managed to import an unrivalled charm and grace.
LINE 38: Even his father-in-law who was not in the best of humour with him was
LINE 39: deeply moved and found himself wiping away a tear.
LINE 40: 'And why have we not seen Tō no Chūjō?' said the Heir Apparent.
LINE 41: Whereupon Chūjō danced the Park of Willow Flowers, giving a far more
LINE 42: complete performance than Genji, for no doubt he knew that he would be
LINE 43: called upon and had taken trouble to prepare his dance. It was a great
LINE 44: success and the Emperor presented him with a cloak, which everyone
LINE 45: said was a most unusual honour. After this the other young noblemen
LINE 46: who were present danced in no particular order, but it was now so dark
LINE 47: that it was impossible to discriminate between their performances.
LINE 48: Then the poems were opened and read aloud. The reading of Genji's
LINE 49: verses was continually interrupted by loud murmurs of applause.
LINE 50: Even the professional poets were deeply impressed, and it may well be
LINE 51: imagined what pride the Emperor, to whom at times Genji was a source
LINE 52: of consolation and delight, watched him upon such an occasion as this.
LINE 53: Fujitsubo, when she allowed herself to glance in his direction,
LINE 54: marvelled that even Kōkiden could find it in her heart to hate him.
LINE 55: 'It is because he is fond of me; there can be no other reason,' she
LINE 56: decided at last and the verse 'Were I but a common mortal who now am
LINE 57: gazing at the beauty of this flower, from its sweet petals not long
LINE 58: should I withhold the dew of love,' framed itself on her lips, though
LINE 59: she dared not utter it aloud.
LINE 60: It was now very late and the banquet was over. The guests had
LINE 61: scattered. The Empress and the Heir Apparent had both returned to the
LINE 62: Palace—all was still. The moon had risen very bright and clear, and
LINE 63: Genji, heated with wine, could not bear to quit so lovely a scene. The
LINE 64: people at the Palace were probably all plunged in a heavy sleep. On
LINE 65: such a night it was not impossible that some careless person might
LINE 66: have left some door unfastened, some shutter unbarred. Cautiously and
LINE 67: stealthily he crept towards Fujitsubo's apartments and inspected them.
LINE 68: Every bolt was fast. He sighed; here there was evidently nothing to be
LINE 69: done. He was passing the loggia of Kōkiden's palace when he noticed
LINE 70: that the shutters of the third arch were not drawn. After the banquet
LINE 71: Kōkiden herself had gone straight to the Emperor's rooms. There did
LINE 72: not seem to be anyone about. A door leading from the loggia into the
LINE 73: house was standing open, but he could hear no sound within. 'It is
LINE 74: under just such circumstances as this that one is apt to drift into
LINE 75: compromising situations,' thought Genji. Nevertheless he climbed
LINE 76: quietly on to the balustrade and peeped. Every one must be asleep. But
LINE 77: no; a very agreeable young voice with an intonation which was
LINE 78: certainly not that of any waiting-woman or common person was softly
LINE 79: humming the last two lines of the _Oborozuki-yo_.[1] Was not the voice
LINE 80: coming towards him? It seemed so, and stretching out his hand he
LINE 81: suddenly found that he was grasping a lady's sleeve. 'Oh, how you
LINE 82: frightened me,' she cried. 'Who is it?' 'Do not be alarmed,' he
LINE 83: whispered. 'That both of us were not content to miss the beauty of
LINE 84: this departing night is proof more clear than the half-clouded moon
LINE 85: that we were meant to meet,' and as he recited the words he took her
LINE 86: gently by the hand and led her into the house, closing the door behind
LINE 87: them. Her surprised and puzzled air fascinated him. 'There is someone
LINE 88: there,' she whispered tremulously, pointing to the inner room. 'Child'
LINE 89: he answered, 'I am allowed to go wherever I please and if you send for
LINE 90: your friends they will only tell you that I have every right to be
LINE 91: here. But if you will stay quietly here....' It was Genji. She knew
LINE 92: his voice and the discovery somewhat reassured her. She thought his
LINE 93: conduct rather strange, but she was determined that he should not
LINE 94: think her prudish or stiff. And so because he on his side was still
LINE 95: somewhat excited after the doings of the evening, while she was far
LINE 96: too young and pliant to offer any serious resistance, he soon got his
LINE 97: own way with her.
LINE 98: Suddenly they saw to their discomfiture that dawn was creeping into
LINE 99: the sky. She looked, thought Genji, as though many disquieting
LINE 100: reflections were crowding into her mind. 'Tell me your name' he said.
LINE 101: 'How can I write to you unless you do? Surely this is not going to be
LINE 102: our only meeting?' She answered with a poem in which she said that
LINE 103: names are of this world only and he would not care to know hers if he
LINE 104: were resolved that their love should last till worlds to come. It
LINE 105: was a mere quip and Genji, amused at her quickness, answered 'You are
LINE 106: quite right. It was a mistake on my part to ask.' And he recited the
LINE 107: poem 'While still I seek to find on which blade dwells the dew, a
LINE 108: great wind shakes the grasses of the level land.' 'If you did not
LINE 109: repent of this meeting,' he continued, 'you would surely tell me who
LINE 110: you are. I do not believe that you want....' But here he was
LINE 111: interrupted by the noise of people stirring in the next room. There
LINE 112: was a great bustle and it was clear that they would soon be starting
LINE 113: out to fetch Princess Kōkiden back from the Palace. There was just
LINE 114: time to exchange fans in token of their new friendship before Genji
LINE 115: was forced to fly precipitately from the room. In his own apartments
LINE 116: he found many of his gentlemen waiting for him. Some were awake, and
LINE 117: these nudged one another when he entered the room as though to say
LINE 118: 'Will he never cease these disreputable excursions?' But discretion
LINE 119: forbade them to show that they had seen him and they all pretended to
LINE 120: be fast asleep. Genji too lay down, but he could not rest. He tried to
LINE 121: recall the features of the lady with whom he had just spent so
LINE 122: agreeable a time. Certainly she must be one of Kōkiden's sisters.
LINE 123: Perhaps the fifth or sixth daughter, both of whom were still
LINE 124: unmarried. The handsomest of them (or so he had always heard) were
LINE 125: Prince Sochi's wife and the fourth daughter, the one with whom Tō no
LINE 126: Chūjō got on so badly. It would really be rather amusing if it did
LINE 127: turn out to be Chūjō's wife. The sixth was shortly to be married to
LINE 128: the Heir Apparent. How tiresome if it were she! But at present he
LINE 129: could think of no way to make sure. She had not behaved at all as
LINE 130: though she did not want to see him again. Why then had she refused to
LINE 131: give him any chance of communicating with her? In fact he worried
LINE 132: about the matter so much and turned it over in his mind with such
LINE 133: endless persistency that it soon became evident he had fallen deeply
LINE 134: in love with her. Nevertheless no sooner did the recollection of
LINE 135: Fujitsubo's serious and reticent demeanour come back to his mind than
LINE 136: he realized how incomparably more she meant to him than this
LINE 137: light-hearted lady.
LINE 138: That day the after-banquet kept him occupied till late at night. At
LINE 139: the Emperor's command he performed on the thirteen-stringed zithern
LINE 140: and had an even greater success than with his dancing on the day
LINE 141: before. At dawn Fujitsubo retired to the Emperor's rooms. Disappointed
LINE 142: in his hope that the lady of last night would somewhere or somehow
LINE 143: make her appearance on the scene, he sent for Yoshikiyo and Koremitsu
LINE 144: with whom all his secrets were shared and bade them keep watch upon
LINE 145: the lady's family. When he returned next day from duty at the Palace
LINE 146: they reported that they had just witnessed the departure of several
LINE 147: coaches which had been drawn up under shelter in the Courtyard of the
LINE 148: Watch. 'Among a group of persons who seemed to be the domestic
LINE 149: attendants of those for whom the coaches were waiting two gentlemen
LINE 150: came threading their way in a great hurry. These we recognized as Shii
LINE 151: no Shōshō and Uchūben,[2] so there is little doubt that the carriages
LINE 152: belonged to Princess Kōkiden. For the rest we noted that the ladies
LINE 153: were by no means ill looking and that the whole party drove away in
LINE 154: three carriages.' Genji's heart beat fast. But he was no nearer than
LINE 155: before to finding out which of the sisters it had been. Supposing her
LINE 156: father, the Minister of the Right, should hear anything of this, what
LINE 157: a to-do there would be! It would indeed mean his absolute ruin. It was
LINE 158: a pity that while he was about it he did not stay with her till it was
LINE 159: a little lighter. But there it was! He did not know her face, but yet
LINE 160: he was determined to recognize her. How? He lay on his bed
LINE 161: devising and rejecting endless schemes. Murasaki too must be growing
LINE 162: impatient. Days had passed since he had visited her and he remembered
LINE 163: with tenderness how low-spirited she became when he was not able to be
LINE 164: with her. But in a moment his thoughts had returned to the unknown
LINE 165: lady. He still had her fan. It was a folding fan with ribs of
LINE 166: hinoki-wood and tassels tied in a splice-knot. One side was covered
LINE 167: with silverleaf on which was painted a dim moon, giving the impression
LINE 168: of a moon reflected in water. It was a device which he had seen many
LINE 169: times before, but it had agreeable associations for him, and
LINE 170: continuing the metaphor of the 'grass on the moor' which she had used
LINE 171: in her poem he wrote on the fan—'Has mortal man ever puzzled his head
LINE 172: with such a question before as to ask where the moon goes to when she
LINE 173: leaves the sky at dawn?' And he put the fan safely away. It was on his
LINE 174: conscience that he had not for a long while been to the Great Hall;
LINE 175: but fearing that Murasaki too might be feeling very unhappy he first
LINE 176: went home to give her her lessons. Every day she was improving not
LINE 177: only in looks, but also in amiability of character. The beauty of her
LINE 178: disposition was indeed quite out of the common. The idea that so
LINE 179: perfect a nature was in his hands, to train and cultivate as he
LINE 180: thought best, was very attractive to Genji. It might however have been
LINE 181: objected that to receive all her education from a young man is likely
LINE 182: to make a girl somewhat forward in her manner.
LINE 183: First there was a great deal to tell her about what had happened at
LINE 184: the Court entertainments of the last few days. Then followed her music
LINE 185: lesson, and already it was time to go. 'Oh why must he always go away
LINE 186: so soon?' she wondered sadly, but by now she was so used to it that
LINE 187: she no longer fretted as she had done a little while ago.
LINE 188: At the Great Hall he could, as usual, scarcely get a word out of
LINE 189: Aoi. The moment that he sat idle a thousand doubts and puzzles began
LINE 190: to revolve in his mind. He took up his zithern and began to sing:
LINE 191: Not softlier pillowed is my head
LINE 192: That rests by thine, unloving bride,
LINE 193: Than were those jagged stones my bed
LINE 194: Through which the falls of Nuki stride.
LINE 195: At this moment Aoi's father came by and began to discuss the unusual
LINE 196: success of the recent festivities. 'Old as I am,' he said—'and I may
LINE 197: say that I have lived to see four illustrious sovereigns occupy the
LINE 198: Throne, I have never taken part in a banquet which produced verses so
LINE 199: spirited or dancing and music so admirably performed. Talent of every
LINE 200: description seems at present to exist in abundance; but it is
LINE 201: creditable to those in authority that they knew how to make good use
LINE 202: of it. For my part I enjoyed myself so much that had I but been a few
LINE 203: years younger I would positively have joined in the dancing!' 'No
LINE 204: special steps were taken to discover the musicians,' answered Genji.
LINE 205: 'We merely used those who were known to the government in one part of
LINE 206: the country and another as capable performers. If I may say so, it was
LINE 207: Chūjō's Willow Dance that made the deepest impression and is likely
LINE 208: always to be remembered as a remarkable performance. But if you, Sir,
LINE 209: had indeed honoured us a new lustre would have been added to my
LINE 210: Father's reign.' Aoi's brothers now arrived and leaning against the
LINE 211: balustrade gave a little concert, their various instruments blending
LINE 212: delightfully.
LINE 213: Fugitive as their meeting had been it had sufficed to plunge the lady
LINE 214: whose identity Prince Genji was now seeking to establish into the
LINE 215: depths of despair; for in the fourth month she was to become the Heir
LINE 216: Apparent's wife. Turmoil filled her brain. Why had not Genji visited
LINE 217: her again? He must surely know whose daughter she was. But how
LINE 218: should he know which daughter? Besides, her sister Kōkiden's house was
LINE 219: not a place where, save under very strange circumstances, he was
LINE 220: likely to feel at all at his ease. And so she waited in great
LINE 221: impatience and distress; but of Genji there was no news.
LINE 222: About the twentieth day of the third month her father, the Minister of
LINE 223: the Right, held an archery meeting at which most of the young noblemen
LINE 224: and princes were present. It was followed by a wistaria feast. The
LINE 225: cherry blossom was for the most part over, but two trees, which the
LINE 226: Minister seemed somehow to have persuaded to flower later than all the
LINE 227: rest, were still an enchanting sight. He had had his house rebuilt
LINE 228: only a short time ago when celebrating the initiation of his
LINE 229: grand-daughters, the children of Kōkiden. It was now a magnificent
LINE 230: building and not a thing in it but was of the very latest fashion. He
LINE 231: had invited Genji when he had met him at the Palace only a few days
LINE 232: before and was extremely annoyed when he did not appear. Feeling that
LINE 233: the party would be a failure if Genji did not come, he sent his son
LINE 234: Shii no Shōshō to fetch him, with the poem: 'Were my flowers as those
LINE 235: of other gardens never should I have ventured to summon you.' Genji
LINE 236: was in attendance upon the Emperor and at once showed him the message.
LINE 237: 'He seems very pleased with himself and his flowers,' said his Majesty
LINE 238: with a smile; adding 'as he has sent for you like this, I think you
LINE 239: had better go. After all your half-sisters are being brought up at his
LINE 240: house, and you ought not to treat him quite as a stranger.' He went to
LINE 241: his apartments and dressed. It was very late indeed when at last he
LINE 242: made his appearance at the party. He was dressed in a cloak of thin
LINE 243: Chinese fabric, white outside but lined with yellow. His robe was of a
LINE 244: deep wine-red colour with a very long train. The dignity and grace
LINE 245: with which he carried this fancifully regal[3] attire in a
LINE 246: company where all were dressed in plain official robes were indeed
LINE 247: remarkable, and in the end his presence perhaps contributed more to
LINE 248: the success of the party than did the fragrance of the Minister's
LINE 249: boasted flowers. His entry was followed by some very agreeable music.
LINE 250: It was already fairly late when Genji, on the plea that the wine had
LINE 251: given him a head-ache, left his seat and went for a walk. He knew that
LINE 252: his two step-sisters, the daughters of Kōkiden, were in the inner
LINE 253: apartments of the palace. He went to the eastern portico and rested
LINE 254: there. It was on this side of the house that the wistaria grew. The
LINE 255: wooden blinds were raised and a number of ladies were leaning out of
LINE 256: the window to enjoy the blossoms. They had hung bright-coloured robes
LINE 257: and shawls over the window-sill just as is done at the time of the New
LINE 258: Year dancing and other gala days and were behaving with a freedom of
LINE 259: allure which contrasted very oddly with the sober decorum of
LINE 260: Fujitsubo's household. 'I am feeling rather overpowered by all the
LINE 261: noise and bustle of the flower-party' Genji explained. 'I am very
LINE 262: sorry to disturb my sisters, but I can think of nowhere else to seek
LINE 263: refuge ...' and advancing towards the main door of the women's
LINE 264: apartments he pushed back the curtain with his shoulder. 'Refuge
LINE 265: indeed!' cried one of the ladies laughing at him. 'You ought to know
LINE 266: by now that it is only poor relations who come to seek refuge with the
LINE 267: more successful members of their family. What pray have you come to
LINE 268: bother us for?' 'Impertinent creatures!' he thought but nevertheless
LINE 269: there was something in their manner which convinced him they were
LINE 270: persons of some consequence in the house and not, as he at first
LINE 271: supposed, mere waiting-women. A scent of costly perfumes pervaded
LINE 272: the room; silken skirts rustled in the darkness. There could be little
LINE 273: doubt that these were Kōkiden's sisters and their friends. Deeply
LINE 274: absorbed, as indeed was the whole of this family, in the fashionable
LINE 275: gaieties of the moment, they had flouted decorum and posted themselves
LINE 276: at the window that they might see what little they could of the
LINE 277: banquet which was proceeding outside. Little thinking that his plan
LINE 278: could succeed, yet led on by delightful recollections of his previous
LINE 279: encounter he advanced towards them chanting in a careless undertone
LINE 280: the song:
LINE 281: At Ishikawa, Ishikawa
LINE 282: A man from Koma[4] took my belt away....
LINE 283: But for 'belt' he substituted 'fan' and by this means he sought to
LINE 284: discover which of the ladies was his friend. 'Why, you have got it
LINE 285: wrong! I never heard of _that_ Korean' one of them cried. Certainly it
LINE 286: was not she. But there was another who though she remained silent
LINE 287: seemed to him to be sighing softly to herself. He stole towards the
LINE 288: curtain-of-state behind which she was sitting and taking her hand in
LINE 289: his at a venture he whispered the poem: 'If on this day of shooting my
LINE 290: arrow went astray, 'twas that in dim morning twilight only the mark
LINE 291: had glimmered in my view.' And she, unable any longer to hide that she
LINE 292: knew him, answered with the verse: 'Had it been with the arrows of the
LINE 293: heart that you had shot, though from the moon's slim bow no brightness
LINE 294: came would you have missed your mark?' Yes, it was her voice. He was
LINE 295: delighted, and yet....

LINE 297: as a night when the moon though dimly clouded is never wholly lost to
LINE 298: sight.'

LINE 300: [3] He had no right to such a costume; for though a son of the

LINE 302: counted as a member of the Imperial family.
