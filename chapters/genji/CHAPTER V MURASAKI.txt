LINE 1: He fell sick of an ague, and when numerous charms and spells had been
LINE 2: tried in vain, the illness many times returning, someone said that in
LINE 3: a certain temple on the Northern Hills there lived a wise and holy man
LINE 4: who in the summer of the year before (the ague was then rife and the
LINE 5: usual spells were giving no relief) was able to work many signal
LINE 6: cures: 'Lose no time in consulting him, for while you try one useless
LINE 7: means after another the disease gains greater hold upon you.' At once
LINE 8: he sent a messenger to fetch the holy man, who however replied that
LINE 9: the infirmities of old age no longer permitted him to go abroad. 'What
LINE 10: is to be done?' said Genji; 'I must go secretly to visit him'; and
LINE 11: taking only four or five trusted servants he set out long before dawn.
LINE 12: The place lay somewhat deep into the hills. It was the last day of the
LINE 13: third month and in the Capital the blossoms had all fallen. The
LINE 14: hill-cherry was not yet out; but as he approached the open country,
LINE 15: the mists began to assume strange and lovely forms, which pleased him
LINE 16: the more because, being one whose movements were tethered by many
LINE 17: proprieties, he had seldom seen such sights before. The temples too
LINE 18: delighted him. The holy man lived in a deep cave hollowed out of a
LINE 19: high wall of rock. Genji did not send in his name and was in close
LINE 20: disguise, but his face was well known and the priest at once
LINE 21: recognized him.
LINE 22: 'Forgive me' he said; 'it was you, was it not, who sent for me the
LINE 23: other day? Alas, I think no longer of the things of this world and I
LINE 24: am afraid I have forgotten how to work my cures. I am very sorry
LINE 25: indeed that you have come so far,' and pretending to be very much
LINE 26: upset, he looked at Genji, laughing. But it was soon apparent that he
LINE 27: was a man of very great piety and learning. He wrote out certain
LINE 28: talismans and administered them, and read certain spells. By the time
LINE 29: this was over, the sun had risen, and Genji went a little way outside
LINE 30: the cave and looked around him. From the high ground where he was
LINE 31: standing he looked down on a number of scattered hermitages. A winding
LINE 32: track led down to a hut which, though it was hedged with the same
LINE 33: small brushwood as the rest, was more spaciously planned, having a
LINE 34: pleasant roofed alley running out from it, and there were trim copses
LINE 35: set around. He asked whose house it was and was told by one of his men
LINE 36: that a certain abbot had been living there in retirement for two
LINE 37: years. 'I know him well' said Genji on hearing the abbot's name; 'I
LINE 38: should not like to meet him dressed and attended as I am. I hope he
LINE 39: will not hear....' Just then a party of nicely dressed children came
LINE 40: out of the house and began to pluck such flowers as are used for the
LINE 41: decoration of altars and holy images. 'There are some girls with them'
LINE 42: said one of Genji's men. 'We cannot suppose that His Reverence keeps
LINE 43: them. Who then can they be?' and to satisfy his curiosity he went a
LINE 44: little way down the hill and watched them. 'Yes, there are some very
LINE 45: pretty girls, some of them grown up and others quite children,' he
LINE 46: came back and reported.
LINE 47: During a great part of the morning Genji was busy with his cure. When
LINE 48: at last the ceremony was completed his attendants, dreading the hour
LINE 49: at which the fever usually returned, strove to distract his
LINE 50: attention by taking him a little way across the mountain to a point
LINE 51: from which the Capital could be seen. 'How lovely' cried Genji 'are
LINE 52: those distances half lost in haze, and that blur of shimmering woods
LINE 53: that stretches out on every side. How could anyone be unhappy for a
LINE 54: single instant who lived in such a place?' 'This is nothing,' said one
LINE 55: of his men. 'If I could but show you the lakes and mountains of other
LINE 56: provinces, you would soon see how far they excel all that you here
LINE 57: admire'; and he began to tell him first of Mount Fuji and many another
LINE 58: famous peak, and then of the West Country with all its pleasant bays
LINE 59: and shores, till he quite forgot that it was the hour of his fever.
LINE 60: 'Yonder, nearest to us' the man continued, pointing to the sea 'is the
LINE 61: bay of Akashi in Harima. Note it well; for though it is not a very
LINE 62: out-of-the-way place, yet the feeling one has there of being shut off
LINE 63: from everything save one huge waste of sea makes it the strangest and
LINE 64: most desolate spot I know. And there it is that the daughter of a lay
LINE 65: priest who was once governor of the province presides over a mansion
LINE 66: of quite disproportionate and unexpected magnificence. He is the
LINE 67: descendant of a Prime Minister and was expected to cut a great figure
LINE 68: in the world. But he is a man of very singular disposition and is
LINE 69: averse to all society. For a time he was an officer in the Palace
LINE 70: Guard, but he gave this up and accepted the province of Harima.
LINE 71: However he soon quarrelled with the local people and, announcing that
LINE 72: he had been badly treated and was going back to the Capital, he did
LINE 73: nothing of the sort, but shaved his head and became a lay priest. Then
LINE 74: instead of settling, as is usually done, on some secluded hillside, he
LINE 75: built himself a house on the seashore, which may seem to you a very
LINE 76: strange thing to do; but as a matter of fact, whereas in that province
LINE 77: in one place or another a good many recluses have taken up their
LINE 78: abode, the mountain-country is far more dull and lonely and would
LINE 79: sorely have tried the patience of his young wife and child; and so as
LINE 80: a compromise he chose the seashore. Once when I was travelling in the
LINE 81: province of Harima I took occasion to visit his house and noted that,
LINE 82: though at the Capital he had lived in a very modest style, here he had
LINE 83: built on the most magnificent and lavish scale; as though determined
LINE 84: in spite of what had happened (now that he was free from the bother of
LINE 85: governing the province) to spend the rest of his days in the greatest
LINE 86: comfort imaginable. But all the while he was making great preparations
LINE 87: for the life to come and no ordained priest could have led a more
LINE 88: austere and pious life.'
LINE 89: 'But you spoke of his daughter?' said Genji. 'She is passably
LINE 90: good-looking,' he answered, 'and not by any means stupid. Several
LINE 91: governors and officers of the province have set their hearts upon her
LINE 92: and pressed their suit most urgently; but her father has sent them all
LINE 93: away. It seems that though in his own person so indifferent to worldly
LINE 94: glory, he is determined that this one child, his only object of care,
LINE 95: should make amends for his obscurity, and has sworn that if ever she
LINE 96: chooses against his will, and when he is gone flouts his set purpose
LINE 97: and injunction to satisfy some idle fancy of her own, his ghost will
LINE 98: rise and call upon the sea to cover her.'
LINE 99: Genji listened with great attention. 'Why, she is like the vestal
LINE 100: virgin who may know no husband but the King-Dragon of the Sea,' and
LINE 101: they laughed at the old ex-Governor's absurd ambitions. The teller of
LINE 102: the story was a son of the present Governor of Harima, who from being
LINE 103: a clerk in the Treasury had last year been capped an officer of the
LINE 104: Fifth Rank. He was famous for his love-adventures and the others
LINE 105: whispered to one another that it was with every intention of
LINE 106: persuading the lady to disobey her father's injunctions that he had
LINE 107: gone out of his way to visit the shore of Akashi.
LINE 108: 'I fear her breeding must be somewhat countrified,' said one; 'it
LINE 109: cannot well be otherwise, seeing that she has grown up with no other
LINE 110: company than that of her old-fashioned parents,—though indeed it
LINE 111: appears that her mother was a person of some consequence.' 'Why, yes'
LINE 112: said Yoshikiyo, the Governor's son, 'and for this reason she was able
LINE 113: to secure little girls and boys from all the best houses in the
LINE 114: Capital, persuading them to pay visits to the sea-side and be
LINE 115: playmates to her own little girl, who thus acquired the most polished
LINE 116: breeding.' 'If an unscrupulous person were to find himself in that
LINE 117: quarter,' said another, 'I fear that despite the dead father's curse
LINE 118: he might not find it easy to resist her.'
LINE 119: The story made a deep impression upon Genji's imagination. As his
LINE 120: gentlemen well knew, whatever was fantastic or grotesque both in
LINE 121: people and situations at once strongly attracted him. They were
LINE 122: therefore not surprised to see him listen with so much attention. 'It
LINE 123: is now well past noon,' said one of them, 'and I think we may reckon
LINE 124: that you will get safely through the day without a return of your
LINE 125: complaint. So let us soon be starting for home.' But the priest
LINE 126: persuaded him to stay a little longer: 'The sinister influences are
LINE 127: not yet wholly banished,' he said; 'it would be well that a further
LINE 128: ritual should continue quietly during the night. By to-morrow morning,
LINE 129: I think you will be able to proceed.' His gentlemen all urged him to
LINE 130: stay; nor was he at all unwilling, for the novelty of such a lodging
LINE 131: amused him. 'Very well then, at dawn' he said, and having nothing to
LINE 132: do till bed-time which was still a long way off, he went out on to the
LINE 133: hill-side, and under cover of the heavy evening mist loitered near the
LINE 134: brushwood hedge. His attendants had gone back to the hermit's
LINE 135: cave and only Koremitsu was with him. In the western wing, opposite
LINE 136: which he was standing, was a nun at her devotions. The blind was
LINE 137: partly raised. He thought she seemed to be dedicating flowers to an
LINE 138: image. Sitting near the middle pillar, a sutra-book propped upon a
LINE 139: stool by her side, was another nun. She was reading aloud; there was a
LINE 140: look of great unhappiness in her face. She seemed to be about forty;
LINE 141: not a woman of the common people. Her skin was white and very fine,
LINE 142: and though she was much emaciated, there was a certain roundness and
LINE 143: fulness in her cheeks, and her hair, clipped short on a level with her
LINE 144: eyes, hung in so delicate a fringe across her brow that she looked,
LINE 145: thought Genji, more elegant and even fashionable in this convent
LINE 146: guise, than if her hair had been long. Two very well-conditioned maids
LINE 147: waited upon her. Several little girls came running in and out of the
LINE 148: room at play. Among them was one who seemed to be about ten years old.
LINE 149: She came running into the room dressed in a rather worn white frock
LINE 150: lined with stuff of a deep saffron colour. Never had he seen a child
LINE 151: like this. What an astonishing creature she would grow into! Her hair,
LINE 152: thick and wavy, stood out fan-wise about her head. She was very
LINE 153: flushed and her lips were trembling. 'What is it? Have you quarrelled
LINE 154: with one of the other little girls?' The nun raised her head as she
LINE 155: spoke and Genji fancied that there was some resemblance between her
LINE 156: and the child. No doubt she was its mother. 'Inu has let out my
LINE 157: sparrow—the little one that I kept in the clothes-basket,' she said,
LINE 158: looking very unhappy. 'What a tiresome boy that Inu is!' said one of
LINE 159: the two maids. 'He deserves a good scolding for playing such a stupid
LINE 160: trick. Where can it have got to? And this after we had taken so much
LINE 161: trouble to tame it nicely! I only hope the crows have not found
LINE 162: it,' and so saying she left the room. She was a pleasant-looking
LINE 163: woman, with very long, wavy hair. The others called her Nurse
LINE 164: Shōnagon, and she seemed to be in charge of the child. 'Come,' said
LINE 165: the nun to the little girl, 'you must not be such a baby. You are
LINE 166: thinking all the time of things that do not matter at all. Just fancy!
LINE 167: Even now when I am so ill that any day I may be taken from you, you do
LINE 168: not trouble your head about me, but are grieving about a sparrow. It
LINE 169: is very unkind, particularly as I have told you I don't know how many
LINE 170: times that it is naughty to shut up live things in cages. Come over
LINE 171: here!' and the child sat down beside her. Her features were very
LINE 172: exquisite; but it was above all the way her hair grew, in cloudy
LINE 173: masses over her temples, but thrust back in childish fashion from her
LINE 174: forehead, that struck him as marvellously beautiful. As he watched her
LINE 175: and wondered what she would be like when she grew up it suddenly
LINE 176: occurred to him that she bore no small resemblance to one whom he had
LINE 177: loved with all his being,[1] and at the resemblance he secretly wept.
LINE 178: The nun, stroking the child's hair, now said to her: 'It's a lovely
LINE 179: mop, though you _are_ so naughty about having it combed. But it
LINE 180: worries me very much that you are still so babyish. Some children of
LINE 181: your age are very different. Your dear mother was only twelve when her
LINE 182: father died; yet she showed herself quite capable of managing her own
LINE 183: affairs. But if I were taken from you now, I do not know what would
LINE 184: become of you, I do not indeed,' and she began to weep. Even Genji,
LINE 185: peeping at the scene from a distance, found himself becoming quite
LINE 186: distressed. The girl, who had been watching the nun's face with a
LINE 187: strange unchildish intensity, now dropped her head disconsolately, and
LINE 188: as she did so her hair fell forward across her cheeks in two
LINE 189: great waves of black. Looking at her fondly the nun recited the poem:
LINE 190: 'Not knowing if any will come to nurture the tender leaf whereon it
LINE 191: lies, how loath is the dewdrop to vanish in the sunny air.' To which
LINE 192: the waiting-woman replied with a sigh: 'O dewdrop, surely you will
LINE 193: linger till the young budding leaf has shown in what fair form it
LINE 194: means to grow.'
LINE 195: At this moment the priest to whom the house belonged entered the room
LINE 196: from the other side: 'Pray, ladies,' he said, 'are you not unduly
LINE 197: exposing yourselves? You have chosen a bad day to take up your stand
LINE 198: so close to the window. I have just heard that Prince Genji has come
LINE 199: to the hermit yonder to be cured of an ague. But he has disguised
LINE 200: himself in so mean a habit that I did not know him, and have been so
LINE 201: near all day without going to pay my respects to him.' The nun started
LINE 202: back in horror; 'How distressing! He may even have passed and seen
LINE 203: us ...' and she hastened to let down the folding blind. 'I am really
LINE 204: very glad that I am to have an opportunity of visiting this Prince
LINE 205: Genji of whom one hears so much. He is said to be so handsome that even
LINE 206: austere old priests like myself forget in his presence the sins and
LINE 207: sorrows of the life they have discarded and take heart to live a little
LINE 208: longer in a world where so much beauty dwells. But you shall hear all
LINE 209: about it....'
LINE 210: Before the old priest had time to leave the house Genji was on his way
LINE 211: back to the hermit's cave. What an enchanting creature he had
LINE 212: discovered! How right too his friends had been on that rainy night
LINE 213: when they told him that on strange excursions such as this beauty
LINE 214: might well be found lurking in unexpected quarters! How delightful to
LINE 215: have strolled out by chance and at once made so astonishing a find!
LINE 216: Whose could this exquisite child be? He would dearly love to have her
LINE 217: always near him, to be able to turn to her at any moment for
LINE 218: comfort and distraction, as once he had turned to the lady in the
LINE 219: Palace.
LINE 220: He was already lying down in the hermit's cave when (everything being
LINE 221: at very close quarters) he heard the voice of the old priest's
LINE 222: disciple calling for Koremitsu. 'My master has just learnt' said this
LINE 223: disciple, 'that you were lodged so near at hand; and though it grieves
LINE 224: him that you did not in passing honour him with a visit, he would at
LINE 225: once have paid his respects to the Prince, had he not thought that
LINE 226: Lord Genji could not be unaware of his presence in the neighbourhood
LINE 227: of this hermitage, and might perhaps have refrained from visiting him
LINE 228: only because he did not wish to disclose the motive of his present
LINE 229: pilgrimage. But my master would remind you' continued the man, 'that
LINE 230: we too in our poor hut could provide you with straw beds to lie on,
LINE 231: and should be sorry if you left without honouring us....'
LINE 232: 'For ten days,' answered Genji from within, 'I have been suffering
LINE 233: from an ague which returned so constantly that I was in despair, when
LINE 234: someone advised me to consult the hermit of this mountain, whom I
LINE 235: accordingly visited. But thinking that it would be very disagreeable
LINE 236: for a sage of his repute if in such a case as mine it became known
LINE 237: that his treatment had been unsuccessful, I was at greater pains to
LINE 238: conceal myself than I should have been if visiting an ordinary
LINE 239: wonder-worker. Pray ask your master to accept this excuse and bid him
LINE 240: enter the cave.' Thus encouraged, the priest presented himself. Genji
LINE 241: was rather afraid of him, for though an ecclesiastic he was a man of
LINE 242: superior genius, very much respected in the secular world, and Genji
LINE 243: felt that it was not at all proper to receive him in the shabby old
LINE 244: clothes which he had used for his disguise. After giving some details
LINE 245: of his life since he had left the Capital and come to live in
LINE 246: retirement on this mountain, the priest begged Genji to come back
LINE 247: with him and visit the cold spring which flowed in the garden of his
LINE 248: hut. Here was an opportunity to see again the people who had so much
LINE 249: interested him. But the thought of all the stories that the old priest
LINE 250: might have told them about him made him feel rather uncomfortable.
LINE 251: What matter? At all costs he must see that lovely child again and he
LINE 252: followed the old priest back to his hut. In the garden the natural
LINE 253: vegetation of the hill-side had been turned to skilful use. There was
LINE 254: no moon, and torches had been lit along the sides of the moat, while
LINE 255: fairy lanterns hung on the trees. The front parlour was very nicely
LINE 256: arranged. A heavy perfume of costly and exotic scents stole from
LINE 257: hidden incense-burners and filled the room with a delicious fragrance.
LINE 258: These perfumes were quite unfamiliar to Genji and he supposed that
LINE 259: they must have been prepared by the ladies of the inner room, who
LINE 260: would seem to have spent considerable ingenuity in the task.
LINE 261: The priest began to tell stories about the uncertainty of this life
LINE 262: and the retributions of the life to come. Genji was appalled to think
LINE 263: how heavy his own sins had already been. It was bad enough to think
LINE 264: that he would have them on his conscience for the rest of his present
LINE 265: life. But then there was also the life to come. What terrible
LINE 266: punishments he had to look forward to! And all the while the priest
LINE 267: was speaking Genji thought of his own wickedness. What a good idea it
LINE 268: would be to turn hermit and live in some such place.... But
LINE 269: immediately his thoughts strayed to the lovely face which he had seen
LINE 270: that afternoon and longing to know more of her 'Who lives with you
LINE 271: here?' he asked. 'It interests me to know, because I once saw this
LINE 272: place in a dream and was astonished to recognize it when I came here
LINE 273: to-day.' At this the priest laughed: 'Your dream seems to have come
LINE 274: rather suddenly into the conversation,' he said, 'but I fear that
LINE 275: if you pursue your enquiry, your expectations will be sadly
LINE 276: disappointed. You have probably never heard of Azechi no Dainagon, he
LINE 277: died so long ago. He married my sister, who after his death turned her
LINE 278: back upon the world. Just at that time I myself was in certain
LINE 279: difficulties and was unable to visit the Capital; so for company she
LINE 280: came to join me here in my retreat.'
LINE 281: 'I have heard that Aseji no Dainagon had a daughter. Is that so?' said
LINE 282: Genji at a venture; 'I am sure you will not think I ask the question
LINE 283: with any indiscreet intention....' 'He had an only daughter who died
LINE 284: about ten years ago. Her father had always wanted to present her at
LINE 285: Court. But she would not listen, and when he was dead and there was
LINE 286: only my sister the nun to look after her, she allowed some wretched
LINE 287: go-between to introduce her to Prince Hyōbukyō whose mistress she
LINE 288: became. His wife, a proud, relentless woman, from the first pursued
LINE 289: her with constant vexations and affronts; day in and day out this
LINE 290: obstinate persecution continued, till at last she died of heartbreak.
LINE 291: They say that unkindness cannot kill; but I shall never say so, for
LINE 292: from this cause alone I saw my kinswoman fall sick and perish.'
LINE 293: 'Then the little girl must be this lady's child,' Genji realized at
LINE 294: last. And that accounted for her resemblance to the lady in the
LINE 295: Palace.[2] He felt more drawn towards her than ever. She was of good
LINE 296: lineage, which is never amiss; and her rather rustic simplicity would
LINE 297: be an actual advantage when she became his pupil, as he was now
LINE 298: determined she should; for it would make it the easier for him to
LINE 299: mould her unformed tastes to the pattern of his own. 'And did the lady
LINE 300: whose sad story you have told me leave no remembrance behind her?'
LINE 301: asked Genji, still hoping to turn the conversation on to the
LINE 302: child herself. 'She died only a short while after her child was born,
LINE 303: and it too was a girl. The charge of it fell to my sister who is in
LINE 304: failing health and feels herself by no means equal to such a
LINE 305: responsibility.' All was now clear. 'You will think it a very strange
LINE 306: proposal,' said Genji, 'but I feel that I should like to adopt this
LINE 307: child. Perhaps you would mention this to your sister? Though others
LINE 308: early involved me in marriage, their choice proved distasteful to me
LINE 309: and having, as it seems, very little relish for society, I now live
LINE 310: entirely alone. She is, I quite realize, a mere child, and I am not
LINE 311: proposing....' Here he paused and the priest answered: 'I am very much
LINE 312: obliged to you for this offer; but I am afraid it is clear that you do
LINE 313: _not_ at all realize that the child in question is a mere infant. You
LINE 314: would not even find her amusing as a casual distraction. But it is
LINE 315: true that a girl as she grows up needs the backing of powerful friends
LINE 316: if she is to make her way in the world, and though I cannot promise
LINE 317: you that anything will come of it, I ought certainly to mention the
LINE 318: matter to her grandmother.' His manner had suddenly become somewhat
LINE 319: cool and severe. Genji felt that he had been indiscreet and preserved
LINE 320: an embarrassed silence. 'There is something which I ought to be doing
LINE 321: in the Hall of Our Lord Amida,' the priest presently continued, 'so I
LINE 322: must take leave of you for a while. I must also read my vespers; but I
LINE 323: will rejoin you afterwards,' and he set out to climb the hill. Genji
LINE 324: felt very disconsolate. It had begun to rain; a cold wind blew across
LINE 325: the hill, carrying with it the sound of a waterfall,—audible till then
LINE 326: as a gentle intermittent plashing, but now a mighty roar; and with it,
LINE 327: somnolently rising and falling, mingled the monotonous chanting of the
LINE 328: scriptures. Even the most unimpressionable nature would have been
LINE 329: plunged into melancholy by such surroundings. How much the more so
LINE 330: Prince Genji, as he lay sleepless on his bed, continually
LINE 331: planning and counter-planning! The priest had spoken of 'vespers,' but
LINE 332: the hour was indeed very late. It was clear however that the nun was
LINE 333: still awake, for though she was making as little noise as possible,
LINE 334: every now and then her rosary would knock with a faint click against
LINE 335: the praying-stool. There was something alluring in the sound of this
LINE 336: low, delicate tapping. It seemed to come from quite close. He opened a
LINE 337: small space between the screens which divided the living-room from the
LINE 338: inner chamber and rustled his fan. He had the impression that someone
LINE 339: in the inner room after a little hesitation had come towards the
LINE 340: screen as though saying to herself 'It cannot be so, yet I could have
LINE 341: sworn I heard ...,' and then retreated a little, as though thinking
LINE 342: 'Well, it was only my fancy after all!' Now she seemed to be feeling
LINE 343: her way in the dark, and Genji said aloud 'Follow the Lord Buddha and
LINE 344: though your way lie in darkness yet shall you not go astray.' Suddenly
LINE 345: hearing his clear young voice in the darkness, the woman had not at
LINE 346: first the courage to reply. But at last she managed to answer: 'In
LINE 347: which direction, please, is He leading me? I am afraid I do not quite
LINE 348: understand.' 'I am sorry to have startled you,' said Genji. 'I have
LINE 349: only this small request to make: that you will carry to your mistress
LINE 350: the following poem: 'Since first he saw the green leaf of the tender
LINE 351: bush, never for a moment has the dew of longing dried from the
LINE 352: traveller's sleeve.' 'Surely you must know that there is no one here
LINE 353: who understands messages of that kind,' said the woman; 'I wonder whom
LINE 354: you mean?' 'I have a particular reason for wishing your mistress to
LINE 355: receive the message,' said Genji, 'and I should be obliged if you
LINE 356: would contrive to deliver it.' The nun at once perceived that the poem
LINE 357: referred to her grandchild and supposed that Genji, having been
LINE 358: wrongly informed about her age, was intending to make love to
LINE 359: her. But how had he discovered her grand-daughter's existence? For
LINE 360: some while she pondered in great annoyance and perplexity, and at last
LINE 361: answered prudently with a poem in which she said that 'he who was but
LINE 362: spending a night upon a traveller's dewy bed could know little of
LINE 363: those whose home was forever upon the cold moss of the hill-side.'
LINE 364: Thus she turned his poem to a harmless meaning. 'Tell her,' said Genji
LINE 365: when the message was brought back, 'that I am not accustomed to carry
LINE 366: on conversations in this indirect manner. However shy she may be, I
LINE 367: must ask her on this occasion to dispense with formalities and discuss
LINE 368: this matter with me seriously!' 'How can he have been thus
LINE 369: misinformed?' said the nun, still thinking that Genji imagined her
LINE 370: grand-daughter to be a grown-up woman. She was terrified at being
LINE 371: suddenly commanded to appear before this illustrious personage and was
LINE 372: wondering what excuse she would make. Her maids, however, were
LINE 373: convinced that Genji would be grievously offended if she did not
LINE 374: appear, and at last, coming out from the women's chamber, she said to
LINE 375: him: 'Though I am no longer a young woman, I very much doubt whether I
LINE 376: ought to come like this. But since you sent word that you have serious
LINE 377: business to discuss with me, I could not refuse....' 'Perhaps' said
LINE 378: Genji, 'you will think my proposal both ill-timed and frivolous. I can
LINE 379: only assure you that I mean it very seriously. Let Buddha judge....'
LINE 380: But here he broke off, intimidated by her age and gravity. 'You have
LINE 381: certainly chosen a very strange manner of communicating this proposal
LINE 382: to me. But though you have not yet said what it is, I am sure you are
LINE 383: quite in earnest about it.' Thus encouraged, Genji continued: 'I was
LINE 384: deeply touched by the story of your long widowhood and of your
LINE 385: daughter's death. I too, like this poor child, was deprived in earliest
LINE 386: infancy of the one being who tenderly loved me, and in my
LINE 387: childhood suffered long years of loneliness and misery. Thus we are
LINE 388: both in like case, and this has given me so deep a sympathy for the
LINE 389: child that I long to make amends for what she has lost. It was, then,
LINE 390: to ask if you would consent to let me play a mother's part that at
LINE 391: this strange and inconvenient hour I trespassed so inconsiderately
LINE 392: upon your patience.' 'I am sure that you are meaning to be very kind,'
LINE 393: said the nun, 'but—forgive me—you have evidently been misinformed.
LINE 394: There is indeed a girl living here under my charge; but she is a mere
LINE 395: infant and could not be of the slightest interest to you in any way,
LINE 396: so that I cannot consent to your proposal.' 'On the contrary,' said
LINE 397: Genji, 'I am perfectly conversant with every detail concerning this
LINE 398: child; but if you think my sympathy for her exaggerated or misplaced,
LINE 399: pray pardon me for having mentioned it.' It was evident that he did
LINE 400: not in the least realize the absurdity of what he had proposed, and
LINE 401: she saw no use in explaining herself any further. The priest was now
LINE 402: returning and Genji, saying that he had not expected she would at once
LINE 403: fall in with his idea and was confident that she would soon see the
LINE 404: matter in a different light, closed the screen behind her.
LINE 405: The night was almost over. In a chapel near by, the Four Meditations
LINE 406: of the Law Flower were being practised. The voices of the ministrants
LINE 407: who were now chanting the Litany of Atonement came floating on the
LINE 408: gusty mountain-wind, and with this solemn sound was mingled the roar
LINE 409: of hurrying waters. 'Startled from my dream by a wandering gust of
LINE 410: the mountain gale, I heard the waterfall, and at the beauty of its
LINE 411: music wept.' So Genji greeted the priest; and he in turn replied with
LINE 412: the poem 'At the noise of a torrent wherein I daily fill my bowl I am
LINE 413: scarce likely to start back in wonder and delight.' 'I get so used to
LINE 414: it,' he added apologetically. A heavy mist covered the morning
LINE 415: sky, and even the chirruping of the mountain-birds sounded muffled and
LINE 416: dim. Such a variety of flowers and blossoming trees (he did not know
LINE 417: their names) grew upon the hill-side, that the rocks seemed to be
LINE 418: spread with a many-coloured embroidery. Above all he marvelled at the
LINE 419: exquisite stepping of the deer who moved across the slope, now
LINE 420: treading daintily, now suddenly pausing; and as he watched them the
LINE 421: last remnants of his sickness were dispelled by sheer delight. Though
LINE 422: the hermit had little use of his limbs, he managed by hook or crook to
LINE 423: perform the mystic motions of the Guardian Spell,[3] and though his
LINE 424: aged voice was husky and faltering, he read the sacred text with great
LINE 425: dignity and fervour. Several of Genji's friends now arrived to
LINE 426: congratulate him upon his recovery, among them a messenger from the
LINE 427: Palace. The priest from the hut below brought a present of
LINE 428: strange-looking roots for which he had gone deep into the ravine. He
LINE 429: begged to be excused from accompanying Genji on his way. 'Till the end
LINE 430: of the year,' he said, 'I am bound by a vow which must deprive me of
LINE 431: what would have been a great pleasure,' and he handed Genji the
LINE 432: stirrup-cup. 'Were I but able to follow my own desires,' said Genji
LINE 433: taking the cup, 'I would not leave these hills and streams. But I hear
LINE 434: that my father the Emperor is making anxious enquiry after me. I will
LINE 435: come back before the blossom is over.' And he recited the verse 'I
LINE 436: will go back to the men of the City and tell them to come
LINE 437: quickly, lest the wild wind outstripping them should toss these
LINE 438: blossoms from the cherry bough.' The old priest, flattered by Genji's
LINE 439: politeness and captivated by the charm of his voice, answered with the
LINE 440: poem: 'Like one who finds the aloe-tree in bloom, to the flower of the
LINE 441: mountain-cherry I no longer turn my gaze.' 'I am not after all quite
LINE 442: so great a rarity as the aloe-flower,' said Genji smiling.
LINE 443: Next the hermit handed him a parting-cup, with the poem 'Though seldom
LINE 444: I open the pine-tree door of my mountain-cell, yet have I now seen
LINE 445: face to face the flower few live to see,' and as he looked up at
LINE 446: Genji, his eyes filled with tears. He gave him, to keep him safe in
LINE 447: future from all harm, a magical wand; and seeing this the nun's
LINE 448: brother in his turn presented a rosary brought back from Korea by
LINE 449: Prince Shōtoku. It was ornamented with jade and was still in the same
LINE 450: Chinese-looking box in which it had been brought from that country.
LINE 451: The box was in an open-work bag, and a five-leafed pine-branch was
LINE 452: with it. He also gave him some little vases of blue crystal to keep
LINE 453: his medicines in, with sprays of cherry-blossom and wistaria along
LINE 454: with them, and such other presents as the place could supply. Genji
LINE 455: had sent to the Capital for gifts with which to repay his reception in
LINE 456: the mountain. First he gave a reward to the hermit, then distributed
LINE 457: alms to the priests who had chanted liturgies on his behalf, and
LINE 458: finally he gave useful presents to the poor villagers of the
LINE 459: neighbourhood. While he was reading a short passage from the
LINE 460: scriptures in preparation for his departure, the old priest went into
LINE 461: his house and asked his sister the nun whether she had any message for
LINE 462: the Prince. 'It is very hard to say anything at present,' she said.
LINE 463: 'Perhaps if he still felt the same inclination four, or five years
LINE 464: hence, we might begin to consider it.' 'That is just what I
LINE 465: think,' said the priest.
LINE 466: Genji saw to his regret that he had made no progress whatever. In
LINE 467: answer to the nun's message he sent a small boy who belonged to the
LINE 468: priest's household with the following poem: 'Last night indeed, though
LINE 469: in the greyness of twilight only, I saw the lovely flower. But to-day
LINE 470: a hateful mist has hidden it utterly from my sight.' The nun replied:
LINE 471: 'That I may know whether indeed it pains you so deeply to leave this
LINE 472: flower, I shall watch intently the motions of this hazy sky.' It was
LINE 473: written in a noteworthy and very aristocratic hand, but quite without
LINE 474: the graces of deliberate artistry. While his carriage was being got
LINE 475: ready, a great company of young lords arrived from the Great Hall,
LINE 476: saying that they had been hard put to it to discover what had become
LINE 477: of him and now desired to give him their escort. Among them were Tō no
LINE 478: Chūjō, Sachū Ben, and other lesser lords, who had come out of
LINE 479: affection for the Prince. 'We like nothing better than waiting upon
LINE 480: you,' they said, rather aggrieved, 'it was not kind of you to leave us
LINE 481: behind.' 'But having come so far,' said another, 'it would be a pity
LINE 482: to go away without resting for a while under the shadow of these
LINE 483: flowering trees'; whereupon they all sat down in a row upon the moss
LINE 484: under a tall rock and passed a rough earthenware wine-jar from hand to
LINE 485: hand. Close by them the stream leaped over the rocks in a magnificent
LINE 486: cascade. Tō no Chūjō pulled out a flute from the folds of his dress
LINE 487: and played a few trills upon it. Sachū Ben, tapping idly with his fan,
LINE 488: began to sing 'The Temple of Toyora.' The young lords who had come to
LINE 489: fetch him were all persons of great distinction; but so striking was
LINE 490: Genji's appearance as he sat leaning disconsolately against the rock
LINE 491: that no eye was likely to be turned in any other direction. One of his
LINE 492: attendants now performed upon the reed-pipe; someone else turned
LINE 493: out to be a skilful _shō_[4] player. Presently the old priest came out
LINE 494: of his house carrying a zithern, and putting it into Genji's hands
LINE 495: begged him to play something, 'that the birds of the mountain may
LINE 496: rejoice.' He protested that he was not feeling at all in the mood to
LINE 497: play; but yielding to the priest's persuasion, he gave what was really
LINE 498: not at all a contemptible performance. After that, they all got up and
LINE 499: started for home. Everyone on the mountain, down to the humblest
LINE 500: priest and youngest neophyte, was bitterly disappointed at the
LINE 501: shortness of his stay, and there were many tears shed; while the old
LINE 502: nun within doors was sorry to think that she had had but that one
LINE 503: brief glimpse of him and might never see him again. The priest
LINE 504: declared that for his part he thought the Land of the Rising Sun in
LINE 505: her last degenerate days ill-deserved that such a Prince should be
LINE 506: born to her, and he wiped his eyes. The little girl too was very much
LINE 507: pleased with him and said he was a prettier gentleman than her own
LINE 508: father. 'If you think so, you had better become his little girl
LINE 509: instead,' said her nurse. At which the child nodded, thinking that it
LINE 510: would be a very good plan indeed; and in future the best-dressed
LINE 511: person in the pictures she painted was called 'Prince Genji' and so
LINE 512: was her handsomest doll.
LINE 513: On his return to the Capital he went straight to the Palace and
LINE 514: described to his father the experiences of the last two days. The
LINE 515: Emperor thought him looking very haggard and was much concerned. He
LINE 516: asked many questions about the hermit's magical powers, to all of
LINE 517: which Genji replied in great detail. 'He ought certainly to have been
LINE 518: made Master Magician long ago,' said His Majesty. 'His ministrations
LINE 519: have repeatedly been attended with great success, but for some reason
LINE 520: his services have escaped public acknowledgment,' and he issued a
LINE 521: proclamation to this effect. The Minister of the Left came to meet him
LINE 522: on his way from the Presence and apologized for not having come with
LINE 523: his sons to bring him back from the mountain. 'I thought,' he said,
LINE 524: 'that as you had gone there secretly, you would dislike being fetched;
LINE 525: but I very much hope that you will now come and spend a few days with
LINE 526: us quietly; after which I shall esteem it a privilege to escort you to
LINE 527: your palace.' He did not in the least want to go, but there was no
LINE 528: escape. His father-in-law drove him to the Great Hall in his own
LINE 529: carriage, and when the bullocks had been unyoked dragged it in at the
LINE 530: gate with his own hands. Such treatment was certainly meant to be very
LINE 531: friendly; but Genji found the Minister's attentions merely irritating.
LINE 532: Aoi's quarters had, in anticipation of Genji's coming, just been put
LINE 533: thoroughly to rights. In the long interval since he last visited her
LINE 534: many changes had been made; among other improvements, a handsome
LINE 535: terrace had been built. Not a thing was out of its right place in this
LINE 536: supremely well-ordered house. Aoi, as usual, was nowhere to be seen.
LINE 537: It was only after repeated entreaties by her father that she at last
LINE 538: consented to appear in her husband's presence. Posed like a princess
LINE 539: in a picture she sat almost motionless. Beautiful she certainly was.
LINE 540: 'I should like to tell you about my visit to the mountain, if only I
LINE 541: thought that it would interest you at all or draw an answer from you.
LINE 542: I hate to go on always like this. Why are you so cold and distant and
LINE 543: proud? Year after year we fail to reach an understanding and you cut
LINE 544: yourself off from me more completely than before. Can we not manage
LINE 545: for a little while to be on ordinary terms? It seems rather strange,
LINE 546: considering how ill I have been, that you should not attempt to
LINE 547: enquire after my health. Or rather, it is exactly what I should
LINE 548: expect; but nevertheless I find it extremely painful.' 'Yes,'
LINE 549: said Aoi, 'it is extremely painful when people do not care what
LINE 550: becomes of one.' She glanced back over her shoulder as she spoke, her
LINE 551: face full of scorn and pride, looking uncommonly handsome as she did
LINE 552: so. 'You hardly ever speak,' said Genji, 'and when you do, it is only
LINE 553: to say unkind things and twist one's harmless words so that they seem
LINE 554: to be insults. And when I try to find some way of helping you for a
LINE 555: while at least to be a little less disagreeable, you become more
LINE 556: hopelessly unapproachable than ever. Shall I one day succeed in making
LINE 557: you understand...?' and so saying he went into their bedroom. She did
LINE 558: not follow him. He lay for a while in a state of great annoyance and
LINE 559: distress. But, probably because he did not really care about her very
LINE 560: much one way or the other, he soon became drowsy and all sorts of
LINE 561: quite different matters drifted through his head. He wanted as much as
LINE 562: ever to have the little girl in his keeping and watch her grow to
LINE 563: womanhood. But the grandmother was right; the child was too absurdly
LINE 564: young, and it would be very difficult to broach the matter again.
LINE 565: Would it not however be possible to contrive that she should be
LINE 566: brought to the Capital? It would be easy then to find excuses for
LINE 567: fetching her and she might, even through some such arrangement as
LINE 568: that, become a source of constant delight to him. The father, Prince
LINE 569: Hyōbukyō, was of course a man of very distinguished manners; but he
LINE 570: was not at all handsome. How was it that the child resembled one of
LINE 571: her aunts and was so unlike all the rest? He had an idea that
LINE 572: Fujitsubo and Prince Hyōbukyō were children of the same mother, while
LINE 573: the others were only half-sisters. The fact that the little girl was
LINE 574: closely related to the lady whom he had loved for so long made him all
LINE 575: the more set upon securing her, and he began again to puzzle his head
LINE 576: for some means of bringing this about.
LINE 577: Next day he wrote his letter of thanks to the priest. No doubt it
LINE 578: contained some allusion to his project. To the nun he wrote: 'Seeing
LINE 579: you so resolutely averse to what I had proposed, I refrained from
LINE 580: justifying my intentions so fully as I could have wished. But should
LINE 581: it prove that, even by the few words I ventured to speak, I was able
LINE 582: to convince you that this is no mere whim or common fancy, how happy
LINE 583: would such news make me.' On a slip of paper folded small and tucked
LINE 584: into the letter he wrote the poem: 'Though with all my heart I tried
LINE 585: to leave it behind me, never for a moment has it left me,—the fair
LINE 586: face of that mountain-flower!' Though she had long passed the zenith
LINE 587: of her years the nun could not but be pleased and flattered by the
LINE 588: elegance of the note; for it was not only written in an exquisite
LINE 589: hand, but was folded with a careless dexterity which she greatly
LINE 590: admired. She felt very sorry for him, and would have been glad, had it
LINE 591: been in her conscience, to have sent him a more favourable reply. 'We
LINE 592: were delighted,' she wrote, 'that being in the neighbourhood you took
LINE 593: occasion to pay us a visit. But I fear that when (as I very much hope
LINE 594: you will) you come here purposely to visit us, I shall not be able to
LINE 595: add anything to what I have said already. As for the poem which you
LINE 596: enclose, do not expect her to answer it, for she cannot yet write her
LINE 597: "Naniwa Zu"[5] properly, even letter by letter. Let me then answer it
LINE 598: for her: "For as long as the cherry-blossoms remain unscattered upon
LINE 599: the shore of Onoe where wild storms blow,—so long have you till now
LINE 600: been constant!" For my part, I am very uneasy about the matter.'
LINE 601: The priest replied to the same effect. Genji was very much
LINE 602: disappointed and after two or three days he sent for Koremitsu and
LINE 603: gave him a letter for the nun, telling him at the same time to
LINE 604: find out whatever he could from Shōnagon, the child's nurse. 'What an
LINE 605: impressionable character he is,' thought Koremitsu. He had only had a
LINE 606: glimpse of the child; but that had sufficed to convince him that she
LINE 607: was a mere baby, though he remembered thinking her quite pretty. What
LINE 608: trick would his master's heart be playing upon him next?
LINE 609: The old priest was deeply impressed by the arrival of a letter in the
LINE 610: hands of so special and confidential a messenger. After delivering it,
LINE 611: Koremitsu sought out the nurse. He repeated all that Genji had told
LINE 612: him to say and added a great deal of general information about his
LINE 613: master. Being a man of many words he talked on and on, continually
LINE 614: introducing some new topic which had suddenly occurred to him as
LINE 615: relevant. But at the end of it all Shōnagon was just as puzzled as
LINE 616: everyone else had been to account for Genji's interest in a child so
LINE 617: ridiculously young. His letter was very deferential. In it he said
LINE 618: that he longed to see a specimen of her childish writing done letter
LINE 619: by letter, as the nun had described. As before, he enclosed a poem:
LINE 620: 'Was it the shadows in the mountain well that told you my purpose was
LINE 621: but jest?'[6] To which she answered 'Some perhaps that have drawn in
LINE 622: that well now bitterly repent. Can the shadows tell me if again it
LINE 623: will be so?' and Koremitsu brought a spoken message to the same
LINE 624: effect, together with the assurance that so soon as the nun's health
LINE 625: improved, she intended to visit the Capital and would then communicate
LINE 626: with him again. The prospect of her visit was very exciting.
LINE 627: About this time Lady Fujitsubo fell ill and retired for a while from
LINE 628: the Palace. The sight of the Emperor's grief and anxiety moved Genji's
LINE 629: pity. But he could not help thinking that this was an opportunity
LINE 630: which must not be missed. He spent the whole of that day in a
LINE 631: state of great agitation, unable whether in his own house or at the
LINE 632: Palace to think of anything else or call upon anyone. When at last the
LINE 633: day was over, he succeeded in persuading her maid Ōmyōbu to take a
LINE 634: message. The girl, though she regarded any communication between them
LINE 635: as most imprudent, seeing a strange look in his face like that of one
LINE 636: who walks in a dream, took pity on him and went. The Princess looked
LINE 637: back upon their former relationship as something wicked and horrible
LINE 638: and the memory of it was a continual torment to her. She had
LINE 639: determined that such a thing must never happen again.
LINE 640: She met him with a stern and sorrowful countenance, but this did not
LINE 641: disguise her charm, and as though conscious that he was unduly
LINE 642: admiring her she began to treat him with great coldness and disdain.
LINE 643: He longed to find some blemish in her, to think that he had been
LINE 644: mistaken, and be at peace.
LINE 645: I need not tell all that happened. The night passed only too quickly.
LINE 646: He whispered in her ear the poem: 'Now that at last we have met, would
LINE 647: that we might vanish forever into the dream we dreamed to-night!' But
LINE 648: she, still conscience-stricken: 'Though I were to hide in the darkness
LINE 649: of eternal sleep, yet would my shame run through the world from tongue
LINE 650: to tongue.' And indeed, as Genji knew, it was not without good cause
LINE 651: that she had suddenly fallen into this fit of apprehension and
LINE 652: remorse. As he left, Ōmyōbu came running after him with his cloak and
LINE 653: other belongings which he had left behind. He lay all day upon his bed
LINE 654: in great torment. He sent a letter, but it was returned unopened. This
LINE 655: had happened many times in the past, but now it filled him with such
LINE 656: consternation that for two or three days he was completely prostrate
LINE 657: and kept his room. All this while he was in constant dread lest
LINE 658: his father, full of solicitude, should begin enquiring what new
LINE 659: trouble had overtaken him. Fujitsubo, convinced that her ruin was
LINE 660: accomplished, fell into a profound melancholy and her health grew
LINE 661: daily worse. Messengers arrived constantly from the Court begging her
LINE 662: to return without delay; but she could not bring herself to go. Her
LINE 663: disorder had now taken a turn which filled her with secret foreboding,
LINE 664: and she did nothing all day long but sit distractedly wondering what
LINE 665: would become of her. When the hot weather set in she ceased to leave
LINE 666: her bed at all. Three months had now passed and there was no mistaking
LINE 667: her condition. Soon it would be known and everywhere discussed. She
LINE 668: was appalled at the calamity which had overtaken her. Not knowing that
LINE 669: there was any cause for secrecy, her people were astonished that she
LINE 670: had not long ago informed the Emperor of her condition. Speculations
LINE 671: were rife, but the question was one which only the Princess herself
LINE 672: was in a position definitely to solve. Ōmyōbu and her old nurse's
LINE 673: daughter who waited upon her at her toilet and in the bath-house had
LINE 674: at once noted the change and were somewhat taken aback. But Ōmyōbu was
LINE 675: unwilling to discuss the matter. She had an uncomfortable suspicion
LINE 676: that it was the meeting which she arranged that had now taken effect
LINE 677: with cruel promptness and precision. It was announced in the Palace
LINE 678: that other disorders had misled those about her and prevented them
LINE 679: from recognizing the true nature of her condition. This explanation
LINE 680: was accepted by everyone.
LINE 681: The Emperor himself was full of tender concern, and though messengers
LINE 682: kept him constantly informed, the gloomiest doubts and fancies passed
LINE 683: continually through his mind. Genji was at this time visited by a most
LINE 684: terrifying and extraordinary dream. He sent for interpreters, but they
LINE 685: could make little of it. There were indeed certain passages to
LINE 686: which they could assign no meaning at all; but this much was clear:
LINE 687: the dreamer had made a false step and must be on his guard. 'It was
LINE 688: not _my_ dream' said Genji, feeling somewhat alarmed. 'I am consulting
LINE 689: you on behalf of someone else,' and he was wondering what this 'false
LINE 690: step' could have been when news reached him of the Princess's
LINE 691: condition. This then was the disaster which his dream had portended!
LINE 692: At once he wrote her an immense letter full of passionate
LINE 693: self-reproaches and exhortations. But Ōmyōbu, thinking that it would
LINE 694: only increase her agitation, refused to deliver it, and he could trust
LINE 695: no other messenger. Even the few wretched lines which she had been in
LINE 696: the habit of sending to him now and again had for some while utterly
LINE 697: ceased.
LINE 698: In her seventh month she again appeared at Court. Overjoyed at her
LINE 699: return, the Emperor lavished boundless affection upon her. The added
LINE 700: fulness of her figure, the unwonted pallor and thinness of her face
LINE 701: gave her, he thought, a new and incomparable charm. As before, all his
LINE 702: leisure was spent in her company. During this time several Court
LINE 703: festivals took place and Genji's presence was constantly required;
LINE 704: sometimes he was called upon to play the _koto_ or flute, sometimes to
LINE 705: serve his father in other ways. On such occasions, strive as he might
LINE 706: to show no trace of embarrassment or agitation, he feared more than
LINE 707: once that he had betrayed himself; while to her such confrontations
LINE 708: were one long torment.
LINE 709: The nun had somewhat improved in health and was now living in the
LINE 710: Capital. He had enquired where she was lodging and sent messages from
LINE 711: time to time, receiving (which indeed was all he expected) as little
LINE 712: encouragement as before. In the last months his longing for the child
LINE 713: had increased rather than diminished, but day after day went by
LINE 714: without his finding any means to change the situation. As the
LINE 715: autumn drew to its close, he fell into a state of great despondency.
LINE 716: One fine moonlit night when he had decided, against his own
LINE 717: inclination, to pay a certain secret visit,[7] a shower came on. As he
LINE 718: had started from the Palace and the place to which he was going was in
LINE 719: the suburbs of the Sixth Ward, it occurred to him that it would be
LINE 720: disagreeable to go so far in the rain. He was considering what he
LINE 721: should do when he noticed a tumbled-down house surrounded by very
LINE 722: ancient trees. He asked whose this gloomy and desolate mansion might
LINE 723: be, and Koremitsu, who, as usual, was with him replied: 'Why that is
LINE 724: the late Azechi no Dainagon's house. A day or two ago I took occasion
LINE 725: to call there and was told that my Lady the nun has grown very weak
LINE 726: and does not now know what goes on about her.' 'Why did you not tell
LINE 727: me this before? 'said Genji deeply concerned; 'I should have called at
LINE 728: once to convey my sympathy to her household. Pray go in at once and
LINE 729: ask for news.' Koremitsu accordingly sent one of the lesser attendants
LINE 730: to the house, instructing him to give the impression that Genji had
LINE 731: come on purpose to enquire. When the man announced that Prince Genji
LINE 732: had sent him for news and was himself waiting outside, great
LINE 733: excitement and consternation prevailed in the house. Their mistress,
LINE 734: the servants said, had for several days been lying in a very parlous
LINE 735: condition and could not possibly receive a visit. But they dared not
LINE 736: simply send so distinguished a visitor away, and hastily tidying the
LINE 737: southern parlour, they bustled him into it, saying, 'You must forgive
LINE 738: us for showing you into this untidy room. We have done our best to
LINE 739: make it presentable. Perhaps, on a surprise visit, you will forgive us
LINE 740: for conducting you to such an out-of-the-way closet....' It was indeed
LINE 741: not at all the kind of room that he was used to. 'I have been
LINE 742: meaning for a long while to visit this house,' said Genji; 'but time
LINE 743: after time the proposals which I made in writing concerning a certain
LINE 744: project of mine were summarily rejected and this discouraged me. Had I
LINE 745: but known that your mistress's health had taken this turn for the
LINE 746: worse....' 'Tell him that at this moment my mind is clear, though it
LINE 747: may soon be darkened again. I am deeply sensible of the kindness he
LINE 748: has shown in thus visiting my death-bed, and regret that I cannot
LINE 749: speak with him face to face. Tell him that if by any chance he has not
LINE 750: altered his mind with regard to the matter that he has discussed with
LINE 751: me before, by all means let him, when the time has come, number her
LINE 752: among the ladies of his household. It is with great anxiety that I
LINE 753: leave her behind me and I fear that such a bond with earth may hinder
LINE 754: me from reaching the life for which I have prayed.'
LINE 755: Her room was so near and the partition so thin that as she gave
LINE 756: Shōnagon her message he could hear now and again the sound of her sad,
LINE 757: quavering voice. Presently he heard her saying to someone 'How kind,
LINE 758: how very kind of him to come. If only the child were old enough to
LINE 759: thank him nicely!' 'It is indeed no question of kindness,' said Genji
LINE 760: to Shōnagon. 'Surely it is evident that only some very deep feeling
LINE 761: would have driven me to display so zealous a persistency! Since first
LINE 762: I saw this child, a feeling of strange tenderness towards her
LINE 763: possessed me, and it has grown to such a love as cannot be of this
LINE 764: world only.[8] Though it is but an idle fancy, I have a longing to
LINE 765: hear her voice. Could you not send for her before I go?' 'Poor little
LINE 766: thing,' said Shōnagon. 'She is fast asleep in her room and knows
LINE 767: nothing of all our troubles.' But as she spoke there was a sound of
LINE 768: someone moving in the women's quarters and a voice suddenly was heard
LINE 769: saying: 'Grandmother, Grandmother! Prince Genji who came to see
LINE 770: us in the mountains is here, paying a visit. Why do you not let him
LINE 771: come and talk to you?' 'Hush, child, hush!' cried all the gentlewomen,
LINE 772: scandalized. 'No, no,' said the child; 'Grandmother said that when she
LINE 773: saw this prince it made her feel better at once. I was not being silly
LINE 774: at all.' This speech delighted Genji; but the gentlewomen of the
LINE 775: household thought the child's incursion painful and unseemly, and
LINE 776: pretended not to hear her last remark. Genji gave up the idea of
LINE 777: paying a real visit and drove back to his house, thinking as he went
LINE 778: that her behaviour was indeed still that of a mere infant. Yet how
LINE 779: easy and delightful it would be to teach her!
LINE 780: Next day he paid a proper visit. On his arrival he sent in a poem
LINE 781: written on his usual tiny slip of paper: 'Since first I heard the
LINE 782: voice of the young crane, my boat shows a strange tendency to stick
LINE 783: among the reeds!' It was meant for the little girl and was written in
LINE 784: a large, childish hand, but very beautifully, so that the ladies of
LINE 785: the house said as soon as they saw it 'This will have to go into the
LINE 786: child's copy-book.'
LINE 787: Shōnagon sent him the following note: 'My mistress, feeling that she
LINE 788: might not live through the day, asked us to have her moved to the
LINE 789: temple in the hills, and she is already on her way. I shall see to it
LINE 790: that she learns of your enquiry, if I can but send word to her before
LINE 791: it is too late.' The letter touched him deeply.
LINE 792: During these autumn evenings his heart was in a continual ferment. But
LINE 793: though all his thoughts were occupied in a different quarter, yet
LINE 794: owing to the curious relationship in which the child stood to the
LINE 795: being who thus obsessed his mind, the desire to make the girl his own
LINE 796: throughout this stormy time grew daily stronger. He remembered the
LINE 797: evening when he had first seen her and the nun's poem, 'Not
LINE 798: knowing if any will come to nurture the tender leaf....' She would
LINE 799: always be delightful; but in some respects she might not fulfil her
LINE 800: early promise. One must take risks. And he made the poem: 'When shall
LINE 801: I see it lying in my hand, the young grass of the moor-side that
LINE 802: springs from purple[9] roots?' In the tenth month the Emperor was to
LINE 803: visit the Suzaku-in for the Festival of Red Leaves. The dancers were
LINE 804: all to be sons of the noblest houses. The most accomplished among the
LINE 805: princes, courtiers and other great gentlemen had been chosen for their
LINE 806: parts by the Emperor himself, and from the Royal Princes and State
LINE 807: Ministers downward everyone was busy with continual practices and
LINE 808: rehearsals. Genji suddenly realized that for a long while he had not
LINE 809: enquired after his friends on the mountain. He at once sent a special
LINE 810: messenger who brought back this letter from the priest: 'The end came
LINE 811: on the twentieth day of last month. It is the common lot of mankind;
LINE 812: yet her loss is very grievous to me!' This and more he wrote, and
LINE 813: Genji, reading the letter was filled with a bitter sense of life's
LINE 814: briefness and futility. And what of the child concerning whose future
LINE 815: the dead woman had shown such anxiety? He could not remember his own
LINE 816: mother's death at all distinctly; but some dim recollection still
LINE 817: floated in his mind and gave to his letter of condolence an added
LINE 818: warmth of feeling. It was answered, not without a certain
LINE 819: self-importance, by the nurse Shōnagon.
LINE 820: After the funeral and mourning were over, the child was brought back
LINE 821: to the Capital. Hearing of this he allowed a short while to elapse and
LINE 822: then one fine, still night went to the house of his own accord. This
LINE 823: gloomy, decaying, half-deserted mansion must, he thought, have a most
LINE 824: depressing effect upon the child who lived there. He was shown
LINE 825: into the same small room as before. Here Shōnagon told him between her
LINE 826: sobs the whole tale of their bereavement, at which he too found
LINE 827: himself strangely moved. 'I would send my little mistress to His
LINE 828: Highness her father's,' she continued, 'did I not remember how cruelly
LINE 829: her poor mother was used in that house. And I would do it still if my
LINE 830: little lady were a child in arms who would not know where she had been
LINE 831: taken to nor what the people there were feeling towards her. But she
LINE 832: is now too big a girl to go among a lot of strange children who might
LINE 833: not treat her kindly. So her poor dead grandmother was always saying
LINE 834: down to her last day. You, Sir, have been very good to us, and it
LINE 835: would be a great weight off my mind to know that she was coming to you
LINE 836: even if it were only for a little while; and I would not worry you
LINE 837: with asking what was to become of her afterwards. Only for her sake I
LINE 838: am sorry indeed that she is not some years older, so that you might
LINE 839: make a match of it. But the way she has been brought up has made her
LINE 840: young even for her age.' 'You need not so constantly remind me of her
LINE 841: childishness,' said Genji. 'Though it is indeed her youth and
LINE 842: helplessness which move my compassion, yet I realize (and why should I
LINE 843: hide it from myself or from you?) that a far closer bond unites our
LINE 844: souls. Let me tell her myself what we have just now decided,' and he
LINE 845: recited a poem in which he asked if 'like the waves that lap the shore
LINE 846: where young reeds grow he must advance only to recede again.' 'Will
LINE 847: she be too much surprised?' he added. Shōnagon, saying that the little
LINE 848: girl should by all means be fetched, answered his poem with another in
LINE 849: which she warned him that he must not expect her to 'drift
LINE 850: seaweed-like with the waves,' before she understood his intention.
LINE 851: 'Now, what made you think I should send you away without letting her
LINE 852: see you?' she asked, speaking in an off-hand, familiar tone which he
LINE 853: found it easy to pardon. His appearance, which the gentlewomen of
LINE 854: the house studied with great care while he sat waiting for the child
LINE 855: and singing to himself a verse of the song _Why so hard to cross the
LINE 856: hill?_ made a deep impression upon them, and they did not forget that
LINE 857: moment for a long while after.
LINE 858: The child was lying on her bed weeping for her grandmother. 'A
LINE 859: gentleman in a big cloak has come to play with you,' said one of the
LINE 860: women who were waiting upon her; 'I wonder if it is your father.' At
LINE 861: this she jumped up and cried out: 'Nurse, where is the gentleman in a
LINE 862: cloak? Is he my father?' and she came running into the room. 'No,'
LINE 863: said Genji, 'it is not your father; but it is someone else who wants
LINE 864: you to be very fond of him. Come....' She had learnt from the way
LINE 865: people talked about him that Prince Genji was someone very important,
LINE 866: and feeling that he must really be very angry with her for speaking of
LINE 867: him as the 'gentleman in a cloak' she went straight to her nurse and
LINE 868: whispered 'Please, I am sleepy.' 'You must not be shy of me any more,'
LINE 869: said Genji. 'If you are sleepy, come here and lie on my knee. Will you
LINE 870: not even come and talk to me?' 'There,' said Shōnagon, 'you see what a
LINE 871: little savage she is,' and pushed the child towards him. She stood
LINE 872: listlessly by his side, passing her hand under her hair so that it
LINE 873: fell in waves over her soft dress or clasping a great bunch of it
LINE 874: where it stuck out thick around her shoulders. Presently he took her
LINE 875: hand in his; but at once, in terror of this close contact with someone
LINE 876: to whom she was not used, she cried out 'I said I wanted to go to
LINE 877: bed,' and snatching her hand away she ran into the women's quarters.
LINE 878: He followed her crying 'Dear one, do not run away from me! Now that
LINE 879: your granny is gone, you must love me instead.' 'Well!' gasped
LINE 880: Shōnagon, deeply shocked. 'No, that is too much! How can you bring
LINE 881: yourself to say such a wicked thing to the poor child? And it is
LINE 882: not much use _telling_ people to be fond of one, is it?' 'For the
LINE 883: moment, it may not be,' said Genji. 'But you will see that strange
LINE 884: things happen if one's heart is set upon a thing as mine is now.'
LINE 885: Hail was falling. It was a wild and terrible night. The thought of
LINE 886: leaving her to pass it in this gloomy and half-deserted mansion
LINE 887: immeasurably depressed him and snatching at this excuse for remaining
LINE 888: near her: 'Shut the partition-door!' he cried. 'I will stay for a
LINE 889: while and play the watchman here on this terrible night. Draw near to
LINE 890: me, all of you!' and so saying, as though it were the most natural
LINE 891: thing in the world, he picked up the child in his arms and carried her
LINE 892: to her bed. The gentlewomen were far too astonished and confounded to
LINE 893: budge from their seats; while Shōnagon, though his high-handed
LINE 894: proceedings greatly agitated and alarmed her, had to confess to
LINE 895: herself that there was no real reason to interfere, and could only sit
LINE 896: moaning in her corner. The little girl was at first terribly
LINE 897: frightened. She did not know what he was going to do with her and
LINE 898: shuddered violently. Even the feel of his delicate, cool skin when he
LINE 899: drew her to him, gave her goose-flesh. He saw this; but none the less
LINE 900: he began gently and carefully to remove her outer garments, and laid
LINE 901: her down. Then, though he knew quite well that she was still
LINE 902: frightened of him, he began talking to her softly and tenderly: 'How
LINE 903: would you like to come with me one day to a place where there are lots
LINE 904: of lovely pictures and dolls and toys?' And he went on to speak so
LINE 905: feelingly of all the things she was most interested in that soon she
LINE 906: felt almost at home with him. But for a long while she was restless
LINE 907: and did not go properly to sleep. The storm still raged. 'Whatever
LINE 908: should we have done if this gentleman had not been here,' whispered
LINE 909: one of the women; 'I know that for my part I should have been in
LINE 910: a terrible fright. If only our little lady were nearer to his age!'
LINE 911: Shōnagon, still mistrustful, sat quite close to Genji all the while.
LINE 912: At last the wind began to drop. The night was far spent; but his
LINE 913: return at such an hour would cause no surprise! 'She has become so
LINE 914: dear to me,' said Genji, 'that, above all at this sad time in her
LINE 915: life, I am loath to leave her even for a few short hours. I think I
LINE 916: shall put her somewhere where I can see her whenever I wish. I wonder
LINE 917: that she is not frightened to live in such a place as this.' 'I think
LINE 918: her father spoke of coming to fetch her,' said Shōnagon; 'but that is
LINE 919: not likely to be till the Forty-nine Days are up.' 'It would of course
LINE 920: under ordinary circumstances be natural that her father should look
LINE 921: after her,' admitted Genji; 'but as she has been brought up entirely
LINE 922: by someone else she has no more reason to care for him than for me.
LINE 923: And though I have known her so short a time, I am certainly far fonder
LINE 924: of her than her father can possibly be.' So saying he stroked the
LINE 925: child's hair and then reluctantly, with many backward glances, left
LINE 926: the room. There was now a heavy white fog, and hoar-frost lay thick on
LINE 927: the grass. Suddenly he found himself wishing that it were a real
LINE 928: love-affair, and he became very depressed. It occurred to him that on
LINE 929: his way home he would pass by a certain house which he had once
LINE 930: familiarly frequented. He knocked at the door, but no one answered. He
LINE 931: then ordered one of his servants who had a strong voice to recite the
LINE 932: following lines: 'By my Sister's gate though morning fog makes all the
LINE 933: world still dark as night, I could not fail to pause.' When this had
LINE 934: been sung twice, the lady sent an impertinent coxcomb of a valet to
LINE 935: the door, who having recited the poem 'If you disliked the hedge of
LINE 936: fog that lies about this place, a gate of crazy wicker would not keep
LINE 937: you standing in the street,' at once went back again into the
LINE 938: house. He waited; but no one else came to the door, and though he was
LINE 939: in no mood to go dully home since it was now broad daylight, what else
LINE 940: could be done? At his palace he lay for a long while smiling to
LINE 941: himself with pleasure as he recollected the child's pretty speeches
LINE 942: and ways. Towards noon he rose and began to write a letter to her; but
LINE 943: he could not find the right words, and after many times laying his
LINE 944: brush aside he determined at last to send her some nice pictures
LINE 945: instead.
LINE 946: That day Prince Hyōbukyō paid his long-promised visit to the late
LINE 947: nun's house. The place seemed to him even more ruinous, vast and
LINE 948: antiquated than he remembered it years ago. How depressing it must be
LINE 949: for a handful of persons to live in these decaying halls, and looking
LINE 950: about him he said to the nurse: 'No child ought to live in a place
LINE 951: like this even for a little while. I must take her away at once; there
LINE 952: is plenty of room in my house. You' (turning to Shōnagon) 'shall be
LINE 953: found a place as a Lady-in-Waiting there. The child will be very well
LINE 954: off, for there are several other young people for her to play with.'
LINE 955: He called the little girl to him and noticing the rich perfume that
LINE 956: clung to her dress since Genji held her in his arms, the Prince said
LINE 957: 'How nicely your dress is scented. But isn't it rather drab?' No
LINE 958: sooner had he said this than he remembered that she was in mourning,
LINE 959: and felt slightly uncomfortable. 'I used sometimes to tell her
LINE 960: grandmother,' he continued, 'that she ought to let her come to see me
LINE 961: and get used to our ways; for indeed it was a strange upbringing for
LINE 962: her to live alone year in year out with one whose health and spirits
LINE 963: steadily declined. But she for some reason was very unfriendly towards
LINE 964: me, and there was in another quarter[10] too a reluctance which I fear
LINE 965: even at such a time as this may not be wholly overcome....' 'If that is
LINE 966: so,' said Shōnagon, 'dull as it is for her here, I do not think
LINE 967: she should be moved till she is a little better able to shift for
LINE 968: herself.'
LINE 969: For days on end the child had been in a terrible state of grief, and
LINE 970: not having eaten the least bite of anything she was grown very thin,
LINE 971: but was none the less lovely for that. He looked at her tenderly and
LINE 972: said: 'You must not cry any more now. When people die, there is no
LINE 973: help for it and we must bear it bravely. But now all is well, for I
LINE 974: have come instead....' But it was getting late and he could not stay
LINE 975: any longer. As he turned to go he saw that the child, by no means
LINE 976: consoled at the prospect of falling under his care, was again crying
LINE 977: bitterly. The Prince, himself shedding a few tears did his best to
LINE 978: comfort her: 'Do not grieve so,' he said, 'to-day or to-morrow I will
LINE 979: send for you to come and live with me,' and with that he departed.
LINE 980: Still the child wept and no way could be found to distract her
LINE 981: thoughts. It was not of course that she had any anxiety about her own
LINE 982: future, for about such matters she had not yet begun to think at all;
LINE 983: but only that she had lost the companion from whom for years on end
LINE 984: she had never for a moment been separated. Young as she was, she
LINE 985: suffered so cruelly that all her usual games were quite abandoned, and
LINE 986: though sometimes during the day her spirits would a little improve, as
LINE 987: night drew on she became so melancholy that Shōnagon began to wonder
LINE 988: how much longer things would go on like this, and in despair at not
LINE 989: being able to comfort her, would herself burst into tears.
LINE 990: Presently Koremitsu arrived with a message saying that Genji had
LINE 991: intended to visit them, but owing to a sudden command from the Palace
LINE 992: was unable to do so, and being very much perturbed at the little one's
LINE 993: grievous condition had sent for further news. Having delivered this
LINE 994: message Koremitsu brought in some of Genji's servants whom he had
LINE 995: sent to mount guard over the house that night. 'This kindness is
LINE 996: indeed ill-placed,' said Shōnagon. 'It may not seem to him of much
LINE 997: consequence that his gentlemen should be installed here; but if the
LINE 998: child's father hears of it, we servants shall get all the blame for
LINE 999: the little lady's being given away to a married gentleman. It was you
LINE 1000: who let it all begin, we shall be told. Now be careful,' she said
LINE 1001: turning to her fellow-servants, 'do not let her even mention these
LINE 1002: watchmen to her father.' But alas, the child was quite incapable of
LINE 1003: understanding such a prohibition, and Shōnagon, after pouring out many
LINE 1004: lamentations to Koremitsu, continued: 'I do not doubt but that in due
LINE 1005: time she will somehow become his wife, for so their fate seems to
LINE 1006: decree. But now and for a long while there can be no talk of any such
LINE 1007: thing, and this, as he has roundly told me, he knows as well as the
LINE 1008: rest of us. So what he is after I cannot for the life of me imagine.
LINE 1009: Only to-day when Prince Hyōbukyō was here he bade me keep a sharp eye
LINE 1010: upon her and not let her be treated with any indiscretion. I confess
LINE 1011: when he said it I remembered with vexation certain liberties which I
LINE 1012: have allowed your master to take, thinking little enough of them at
LINE 1013: the time.' No sooner had she said this than she began to fear that
LINE 1014: Koremitsu would put a worse construction on her words than she
LINE 1015: intended, and shaking her head very dolefully she relapsed into
LINE 1016: silence. Nor was she far wrong, for Koremitsu was indeed wondering of
LINE 1017: what sort Genji's misdemeanours could have been.
LINE 1018: On hearing Koremitsu's report Genji's heart was filled with pity for
LINE 1019: the child's state and he would like to have gone to her at once. But
LINE 1020: he feared that ignorant people would misunderstand these frequent
LINE 1021: visits and, thinking the girl older than she was, spread foolish
LINE 1022: scandals abroad. It would be far simpler to fetch her to his
LINE 1023: Palace and keep her there. All through the day he sent numerous
LINE 1024: letters, and at dusk Koremitsu again went to the house saying that
LINE 1025: urgent business had once more prevented Genji from visiting them, for
LINE 1026: which remissness he tendered his apologies. Shōnagon answered curtly
LINE 1027: that the girl's father had suddenly decided to fetch her away next day
LINE 1028: and that they were too busy to receive visits: 'The servants are all
LINE 1029: in a fluster at leaving this shabby old house where they have lived so
LINE 1030: long and going to a strange, grand place....' She answered his further
LINE 1031: questions so briefly and seemed so intent upon her sewing, that
LINE 1032: Koremitsu went away.
LINE 1033: Genji was at the Great Hall, but as usual he had been unable to get a
LINE 1034: word out of Aoi and in a gloomy mood he was plucking at his zithern
LINE 1035: and singing 'Why sped you across field and hill So fast upon this
LINE 1036: rainy night?'[11]
LINE 1037: The words of the song were aimed at Aoi and he sang them with much
LINE 1038: feeling. He was thus employed when Koremitsu arrived at the Great
LINE 1039: Hall. Genji sent for him at once and bade him tell his story.
LINE 1040: Koremitsu's news was very disquieting. Once she was in her father's
LINE 1041: palace it would look very odd that Genji should fetch her away, even
LINE 1042: if she came willingly. It would inevitably be rumoured abroad that he
LINE 1043: had made off with her like a child-snatcher, a thief. Far better to
LINE 1044: anticipate his rival and exacting a promise of silence from the people
LINE 1045: about her, carry her off to his own palace immediately. 'I shall go
LINE 1046: there at daybreak,' he said to Koremitsu; 'Order the carriage that I
LINE 1047: came here in, it can be used just as it is, and see to it that one or
LINE 1048: two attendants are ready to go with me.' Koremitsu bowed and retired.
LINE 1049: Genji knew that whichever course he chose, there was bound to be
LINE 1050: a scandal so soon as the thing became known. Inevitably gossips would
LINE 1051: spread the report that, young though she was, the child by this time
LINE 1052: knew well enough why she had been invited to live with Prince Genji in
LINE 1053: his palace. Let them draw their own conclusions. That did not matter.
LINE 1054: There was a much worse possibility. What if Hyōbukyō found out where
LINE 1055: she was? His conduct in abducting another man's child would appear in
LINE 1056: the highest degree outrageous and discreditable. He was sorely
LINE 1057: puzzled, but he knew that if he let this opportunity slip he would
LINE 1058: afterwards bitterly repent it, and long before daybreak he started on
LINE 1059: his way. Aoi was cold and sullen as ever. 'I have just remembered
LINE 1060: something very important which I must see about at home,' he said; 'I
LINE 1061: shall not be away long,' and he slipped out so quietly that the
LINE 1062: servants of the house did not know that he was gone. His cloak was
LINE 1063: brought to him from his own apartments and he drove off attended only
LINE 1064: by Koremitsu who followed on horseback. After much knocking they
LINE 1065: succeeded in getting the gate opened, but by a servant who was not in
LINE 1066: the secret. Koremitsu ordered the man to pull in Genji's carriage as
LINE 1067: quietly as he could and himself went straight to the front door, which
LINE 1068: he rattled, coughing as he did so that Shōnagon might know who was
LINE 1069: there. 'My lord is waiting,' he said when she came to the door. 'But
LINE 1070: the young lady is fast asleep,' said Shōnagon; 'his Highness has no
LINE 1071: business to be up and about at this time of night.' She said this
LINE 1072: thinking that he was returning from some nocturnal escapade and had
LINE 1073: only called there in passing. 'I hear,' said Genji now coming forward,
LINE 1074: 'that the child is to be moved to her father's and I have something of
LINE 1075: importance which I must say to her before she goes.' 'Whatever
LINE 1076: business you have to transact with her, I am sure she will give the
LINE 1077: matter her closest attention,' scoffed Shōnagon. Matters of
LINE 1078: importance indeed, with a child of ten! Genji entered the women's
LINE 1079: quarters. 'You cannot go in there,' cried Shōnagon in horror; 'several
LINE 1080: aged ladies are lying all undressed....' 'They are all fast asleep,'
LINE 1081: said Genji. 'See, I am only rousing the child,' and bending over her:
LINE 1082: 'The morning mist is rising,' he cried, 'it is time to wake!' And
LINE 1083: before Shōnagon had time to utter a sound, he had taken the child in
LINE 1084: his arms and begun gently to rouse her. Still half-dreaming, she
LINE 1085: thought it was the prince her father who had come to fetch her. 'Come,'
LINE 1086: said Genji while he put her hair to rights, 'your father has sent me
LINE 1087: to bring you back with me to his palace.' For a moment she was dazed
LINE 1088: to find that it was not her father and shrank from him in fright.
LINE 1089: 'Never mind whether it is your father or I,' he cried; 'it is all the
LINE 1090: same,' and so saying he picked her up in his arms and carried her out
LINE 1091: of the inner room. 'Well!' cried out Koremitsu and Shōnagon in
LINE 1092: astonishment. What would he do next? 'It seems,' said Genji, 'that you
LINE 1093: were disquieted at my telling you I could not visit her here as often
LINE 1094: as I wished and would make arrangements for her to go to a more
LINE 1095: convenient place. I hear that you are sending her where it will be
LINE 1096: even more difficult for me to see her. Therefore ... make ready one or
LINE 1097: the other of you to come with me.'
LINE 1098: Shōnagon, who now realized that he was going to make off with the
LINE 1099: child, fell into a terrible fluster. 'O Sir,' she said, 'you could not
LINE 1100: have chosen a worse time. To-day her father is coming to fetch her,
LINE 1101: and whatever shall I say to him? If only you would wait, I am sure it
LINE 1102: would all come right in the end. But by acting so hastily you will do
LINE 1103: yourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle.'
LINE 1104: 'If that is all,' cried Genji, 'let them follow as soon as they
LINE 1105: choose,' and to Shōnagon's despair he had the carriage brought in. The
LINE 1106: child stood by weeping and bewildered. There seemed no way of
LINE 1107: preventing him from carrying out his purpose and gathering together
LINE 1108: the child's clothes that she had been sewing the night before, the
LINE 1109: nurse put on her own best dress and stepped into the carriage. Genji's
LINE 1110: house was not far off and they arrived before daylight. They drew up
LINE 1111: in front of the western wing and Genji alighted. Taking the child
LINE 1112: lightly in his arms he set her on the ground. Shōnagon, to whom these
LINE 1113: strange events seemed like a dream, hesitated as though still
LINE 1114: uncertain whether she should enter the house or no. 'There is no need
LINE 1115: for you to come in if you do not want to,' said Genji. 'Now that the
LINE 1116: child herself is safely here I am quite content. If you had rather go
LINE 1117: back, you have only to say so and I will escort you.'
LINE 1118: Reluctantly she left the carriage. The suddenness of the move was in
LINE 1119: itself enough to have upset her; but she was also worrying about what
LINE 1120: Prince Hyōbukyō would think when he found that his child had vanished.
LINE 1121: And indeed what _was_ going to become of her? One way or another all her
LINE 1122: mistresses seemed to be taken from her and it was only when she became
LINE 1123: frightened of having wept for so long on end that she at last dried
LINE 1124: her eyes and began to pray.
LINE 1125: The western wing had long been uninhabited and was not completely
LINE 1126: furnished; but Koremitsu had soon fitted up screens and curtains where
LINE 1127: they were required. For Genji makeshift quarters were soon contrived
LINE 1128: by letting down the side-wings of his screen-of-honour. He sent to the
LINE 1129: other part of the house for his night things and went to sleep. The
LINE 1130: child, who had been put to bed not far off, was still very
LINE 1131: apprehensive and ill at ease in these new surroundings. Her lips were
LINE 1132: trembling, but she dared not cry out loud. 'I want to sleep with
LINE 1133: Shōnagon,' she said at last in a tearful, babyish voice. 'You are
LINE 1134: getting too big to sleep with a nurse,' said Genji, who had heard her.
LINE 1135: 'You must try and go to sleep nicely where you are.' She felt
LINE 1136: very lonely and lay weeping for a long while. The nurse was far too
LINE 1137: much upset to think of going to bed and sat up for the rest of the
LINE 1138: night in the servants' quarters crying so bitterly that she was
LINE 1139: unconscious of all that went on around her.
LINE 1140: But when it grew light she began to look about her a little. Not only
LINE 1141: this great palace with its marvellous pillars and carvings, but the
LINE 1142: sand in the courtyard outside which seemed to her like a carpet of
LINE 1143: jewels made so dazzling an impression upon her that at first she felt
LINE 1144: somewhat overawed. However, the fact that she was now no longer in a
LINE 1145: household of women gave her an agreeable sense of security.
LINE 1146: It was the hour at which business brought various strangers to the
LINE 1147: house. There were several men walking just outside her window and she
LINE 1148: heard one of them whisper to another: 'They say that someone new has
LINE 1149: come to live here. Who can it be, I wonder? A lady of note, I'll
LINE 1150: warrant you.'
LINE 1151: Bath water was brought from the other wing, and steamed rice for
LINE 1152: breakfast. Genji did not rise till far on into the morning. 'It is not
LINE 1153: good for the child to be alone,' he said to Shōnagon, 'so last night
LINE 1154: before I came to you I arranged for some little people to come and
LINE 1155: stay here,' and so saying he sent a servant to 'fetch the little girls
LINE 1156: from the eastern wing.' He had given special orders that they were to
LINE 1157: be as small as possible and now four of the tiniest and prettiest
LINE 1158: creatures imaginable arrived upon the scene.
LINE 1159: Murasaki was still asleep, lying wrapped in Genji's own coat. It was
LINE 1160: with difficulty that he roused her. 'You must not be sad any more,' he
LINE 1161: said; 'If I were not very fond of you, should I be looking after you
LINE 1162: like this? Little girls ought to be very gentle and obedient in their
LINE 1163: ways.' And thus her education was begun.
LINE 1164: She seemed to him, now that he could study her at leisure, even
LINE 1165: more lovely than he had realized and they were soon engaged in an
LINE 1166: affectionate conversation. He sent for delightful pictures and toys to
LINE 1167: show her and set to work to amuse her in every way he could. Gradually
LINE 1168: he persuaded her to get up and look about her. In her shabby dress
LINE 1169: made of some dark grey material she looked so charming now that she
LINE 1170: was laughing and playing, with all her woes forgotten, that Genji too
LINE 1171: laughed with pleasure as he watched her. When at last he retired to
LINE 1172: the eastern wing, she went out of doors to look at the garden. As she
LINE 1173: picked her way among the trees and along the side of the lake, and
LINE 1174: gazed with delight upon the frosty flower-beds that glittered gay as a
LINE 1175: picture, while a many-coloured throng of unknown people passed
LINE 1176: constantly in and out of the house, she began to think that this was a
LINE 1177: very nice place indeed. Then she looked at the wonderful pictures that
LINE 1178: were painted on all the panels and screens and quite lost her heart to
LINE 1179: them.
LINE 1180: For two or three days Genji did not go to the Palace, but spent all
LINE 1181: his time amusing the little girl. Finally he drew all sorts of
LINE 1182: pictures for her to put into her copy-book, showing them to her one by
LINE 1183: one as he did so. She thought them the loveliest set of pictures she
LINE 1184: had ever seen. Then he wrote part of the _Musashi-no_ poem.[12] She
LINE 1185: was delighted by the way it was written in bold ink-strokes on a
LINE 1186: background stained with purple. In a smaller hand was the poem:
LINE 1187: 'Though the parent-root[13] I cannot see, yet tenderly I love its
LINE 1188: off-shoot,[14]—the dewy plant that grows upon Musashi Moor.' 'Come'
LINE 1189: said Genji while she was admiring it, 'you must write something too.'
LINE 1190: 'I cannot write properly yet' she answered, looking up at him with a
LINE 1191: witchery so wholly unconscious that Genji laughed. 'Even if you
LINE 1192: cannot write properly it will never do for us to let you off
LINE 1193: altogether. Let me give you a lesson.' With many timid glances towards
LINE 1194: him she began to write. Even the childish manner in which she grasped
LINE 1195: the brush gave him a thrill of delight which he was at a loss to
LINE 1196: explain. 'Oh, I have spoiled it' she suddenly cried out and blushing
LINE 1197: hid from him what she had written. But he forced her to let him see it
LINE 1198: and found the poem: 'I do not know what put Musashi into your head and
LINE 1199: am very puzzled. What plant is it that you say is a relative of mine?'
LINE 1200: It was written in a large childish hand which was indeed very
LINE 1201: undeveloped, but was nevertheless full of promise. It showed a strong
LINE 1202: resemblance to the late nun's writing. He felt certain that if she
LINE 1203: were given up-to-date copy-books she would soon write very nicely.
LINE 1204: Next they built houses for the dolls and played so long at this game
LINE 1205: together that Genji forgot for a while the great anxiety[15] which was
LINE 1206: at that time preying upon his mind.
LINE 1207: The servants who had been left behind at Murasaki's house were
LINE 1208: extremely embarrassed when Prince Hyōbukyō came to fetch her. Genji
LINE 1209: had made them promise for a time at any rate to tell no one of what
LINE 1210: had happened and Shōnagon had seemed to agree that this was best.
LINE 1211: Accordingly he could get nothing out of them save that Shōnagon had
LINE 1212: taken the child away with her without saying anything about where she
LINE 1213: was going. The Prince felt completely baffled. Perhaps the grandmother
LINE 1214: had instilled into the nurse's mind the idea that things would not go
LINE 1215: smoothly for the child at his palace. In that case the nurse with an
LINE 1216: excess of craftiness might, instead of openly saying that she feared
LINE 1217: the child would not be well treated under his roof, have thought it
LINE 1218: wiser to make off with her when opportunity offered. He went home
LINE 1219: very depressed, asking them to let him know instantly if they had any
LINE 1220: news, a request which again embarrassed them. He also made enquiries
LINE 1221: of the priest at the temple in the hills, but could learn nothing. She
LINE 1222: had seemed to him to be a most lovable and delightful child; it was
LINE 1223: very disappointing to lose sight of her in this manner. The princess
LINE 1224: his wife had long ago got over her dislike of the child's mother and
LINE 1225: was indignant at the idea that she was not to be trusted to do her
LINE 1226: duty by the child properly.
LINE 1227: Gradually the servants from Murasaki's house assembled at her new
LINE 1228: home. The little girls who had been brought to play with her were
LINE 1229: delighted with their new companion and they were soon all playing
LINE 1230: together very happily.
LINE 1231: When her prince was away or busy, on dreary evenings she would still
LINE 1232: sometimes long for her grandmother the nun and cry a little. But she
LINE 1233: never thought about her father whom she had never been used to see
LINE 1234: except at rare intervals. Now indeed she had 'a new father' of whom
LINE 1235: she was growing every day more fond. When he came back from anywhere
LINE 1236: she was the first to meet him and then wonderful games and
LINE 1237: conversations began, she sitting all the while on his lap without the
LINE 1238: least shyness or restraint. A more charming companion could not have
LINE 1239: been imagined. It might be that when she grew older, she would not
LINE 1240: always be so trustful. New aspects of her character might come into
LINE 1241: play. If she suspected, for example, that he cared for someone else,
LINE 1242: she might resent it, and in such a case all sorts of unexpected things
LINE 1243: are apt to happen; but for the present she was a delightful plaything.
LINE 1244: Had she really been his daughter, convention would not have allowed
LINE 1245: him to go on much longer living with her on terms of such complete
LINE 1246: intimacy; but in a case like this he felt that such scruples were not
LINE 1247: applicable.
LINE 1248: [1] Fujitsubo, who was indeed the child's aunt.
LINE 1249: [2] Fujitsubo, who was Hyōbukyō's sister.
LINE 1250: [3] The Guardian Spell (_goshin_) is practised as follows:
LINE 1251: The ministrant holds the palms of his hands together with middle
LINE 1252: fingers touching and extended, first fingers separated and bent,
LINE 1253: tips of thumbs and little fingers bunched together, and third
LINE 1254: fingers in line with middle fingers so as to be invisible from in
LINE 1255: front. With hands in this sacred pose (_mudrā_) he touches the
LINE 1256: worshipper on forehead, left and right shoulder, heart and throat.
LINE 1257: At each contact he utters the spell
LINE 1258: ON · BASARA GONJI HARAJŪBATA · SOHAKA
LINE 1259: which is corrupt Sanskrit and means 'I invoke thee, thou
LINE 1260: diamond-fiery very majestic Star.' The deity here invoked is
LINE 1261: Vairocana, favourite Buddha of the Mystic Sect.
LINE 1262: [4] A Chinese instrument; often translated 'mouth-organ.'
LINE 1263: [5] A song the words of which were used as a first writing lesson.
LINE 1264: [6] There is here a pun, and a reference to poem 3807 in the _Manyōshū_.
LINE 1265: [7] To Lady Rokujō.
LINE 1266: [8] Arises out of some connection in a previous existence.
LINE 1267: [9] Purple is _murasaki_ in Japanese. From this poem the child is
LINE 1268: known as Murasaki; and hence the authoress derived the nickname by
LINE 1269: which she too is known.
LINE 1270: [10] His wife.
LINE 1271: [11] The song is addressed by a girl to a suspicious lover; Genji
LINE 1272: reverses the sense.
LINE 1273: [12] 'Though I know not the place, yet when they told me this was the
LINE 1274: moor of Musashi, the thought flashed through my mind: "What else
LINE 1275: indeed could it be, since all its grass is purple-dyed?"'
LINE 1276: [13] Fujitsubo. The fuji flower is also purple (_murasaki_) in colour.
LINE 1277: [14] The child Murasaki, who was Fujitsubo's niece. Musashi was famous
LINE 1278: for the purple dye extracted from the roots of a grass that grew there.
LINE 1279: [15] The pregnancy of Fujitsubo.
