LINE 1: The imperial visit to the Red Sparrow Court was to take place on the
LINE 2: tenth day of the Godless Month. It was to be a more magnificent sight
LINE 3: this year than it had ever been before and the ladies of the Palace
LINE 4: were very disappointed that they could not be present.[1] The Emperor
LINE 5: too could not bear that Fujitsubo should miss the spectacle, and he
LINE 6: decided to hold a grand rehearsal in the Palace. Prince Genji danced
LINE 7: the 'Waves of the Blue Sea.' Tō no Chūjō was his partner; but though
LINE 8: both in skill and beauty he far surpassed the common run of
LINE 9: performers, yet beside Genji he seemed like a mountain fir growing
LINE 10: beside a cherry-tree in bloom. There was a wonderful moment when the
LINE 11: rays of the setting sun fell upon him and the music grew suddenly
LINE 12: louder. Never had the onlookers seen feet tread so delicately nor head
LINE 13: so exquisitely poised; and in the song which follows the first
LINE 14: movement of the dance his voice was sweet as that of Kalavinka[2]
LINE 15: whose music is Buddha's Law. So moving and beautiful was this dance
LINE 16: that at the end of it the Emperor's eyes were wet, and all the princes
LINE 17: and great gentlemen wept aloud. When the song was over and,
LINE 18: straightening his long dancer's sleeves, he stood waiting for the
LINE 19: music to begin again and at last the more lively tune of the second
LINE 20: movement struck up,—then indeed, with his flushed and eager face,
LINE 21: he merited more than ever his name of Genji the Shining One. The
LINE 22: Princess Kōkiden[3] did not at all like to see her step-son's beauty
LINE 23: arousing so much enthusiasm and she said sarcastically 'He is
LINE 24: altogether too beautiful. Presently we shall have a god coming down
LINE 25: from the sky to fetch him away.'[4] Her young waiting-ladies noticed
LINE 26: the spiteful tone in which the remark was made and felt somewhat
LINE 27: embarrassed. As for Fujitsubo, she kept on telling herself that were
LINE 28: it not for the guilty secret which was shared between them the dance
LINE 29: she was now witnessing would be filling her with wonder and delight.
LINE 30: As it was, she sat as though in a dream, hardly knowing what went on
LINE 31: around her.
LINE 32: Now she was back in her own room. The Emperor was with her. 'At
LINE 33: to-day's rehearsal' he said, 'The "Waves of the Blue Sea" went
LINE 34: perfectly.' Then, noticing that she made no response, 'What did you
LINE 35: think of it?' 'Yes, it was very good,' she managed to say at last.
LINE 36: 'The partner did not seem to me bad either,' he went on; 'there is
LINE 37: always something about the way a gentleman moves and uses his hands
LINE 38: which distinguishes his dancing from that of professionals. Some of
LINE 39: our crack dancing-masters have certainly made very clever performers
LINE 40: of their own children; but they never have the same freshness, the
LINE 41: same charm as the young people of our class. They expended so much
LINE 42: effort on the rehearsal that I am afraid the festival itself may seem
LINE 43: a very poor affair. No doubt they took all this trouble because they
LINE 44: knew that you were here at the rehearsal and would not see the real
LINE 45: performance.'
LINE 46: Next morning she received a letter from Genji: 'What of the rehearsal?
LINE 47: How little the people who watched me knew of the turmoil that all
LINE 48: the while was seething in my brain!' And to this he added the
LINE 49: poem: 'When sick with love I yet sprang to my feet and capered
LINE 50: with the rest, knew you what meant the fevered waving of my long
LINE 51: dancing-sleeve?' Next he enjoined secrecy and prudence upon her, and
LINE 52: so his letter ended. Her answer showed that despite her agitation she
LINE 53: had not been wholly insensible to what had fascinated all other eyes:
LINE 54: 'Though from far off a man of China waved his long dancing-sleeves,
LINE 55: yet did his every motion fill my heart with wonder and delight.'
LINE 56: To receive such a letter from her was indeed a surprise. It charmed
LINE 57: him that her knowledge should extend even to the Court customs of a
LINE 58: land beyond the sea. Already there was a regal note in her words. Yes,
LINE 59: that was the end to which she was destined. Smiling to himself with
LINE 60: pleasure he spread the letter out before him, grasping it tightly in
LINE 61: both hands as a priest holds the holy book, and gazed at it for a long
LINE 62: while.
LINE 63: On the day of the festival the royal princes and all the great
LINE 64: gentlemen of the Court were in attendance. Even the Heir Apparent went
LINE 65: with the procession. After the music-boats had rowed round the lake
LINE 66: dance upon dance was performed, both Korean and of the land beyond the
LINE 67: sea. The whole valley resounded with the noise of music and drums. The
LINE 68: Emperor insisted upon treating Genji's performance at the rehearsal as
LINE 69: a kind of miracle or religious portent, and ordered special services
LINE 70: to be read in every temple. Most people thought this step quite
LINE 71: reasonable; but Princess Kōkiden said crossly that she saw no
LINE 72: necessity for it. The Ring[5] was by the Emperor's order composed
LINE 73: indifferently of commoners and noblemen chosen out of the whole realm
LINE 74: for their skill and grace. The two Masters of Ceremony, Sayemon no
LINE 75: Kami and Uyemon no Kami, were in charge of the left and right
LINE 76: wings of the orchestra. Dancing-masters and others were entrusted with
LINE 77: the task of seeking out performers of unusual merit and training them
LINE 78: for the festival in their own houses. When at last under the red
LINE 79: leafage of tall autumn trees forty men stood circle-wise with their
LINE 80: flutes and to the music that they made a strong wind from the hills
LINE 81: sweeping the pine-woods added its fierce harmonies, while from amid a
LINE 82: wreckage of whirling and scattered leaves the Dance of the Blue Waves
LINE 83: suddenly broke out in all its glittering splendour,—a rapture seized
LINE 84: the onlookers that was akin to fear.
LINE 85: The maple-wreath that Genji wore had suffered in the wind and thinking
LINE 86: that the few red leaves which clung to it had a desolate air the
LINE 87: Minister of the Left[6] plucked a bunch of chrysanthemums from among
LINE 88: those that grew before the Emperor's seat and twined them in the
LINE 89: dancer's wreath.
LINE 90: At sunset the sky clouded over and it looked like rain. But even the
LINE 91: weather seemed conscious that such sights as this would not for a long
LINE 92: while be seen again, and till all was over not a drop fell. His Exit
LINE 93: Dance, crowned as he was with this unspeakably beautiful wreath of
LINE 94: many coloured flowers, was even more astonishing than that wonderful
LINE 95: moment on the day of the rehearsal and seemed to the thrilled
LINE 96: onlookers like the vision of another world. Humble and ignorant folk
LINE 97: sitting afar on tree-roots or beneath some rock, or half-buried in
LINE 98: deep banks of fallen leaves—few were so hardened that they did not
LINE 99: shed a tear. Next came the 'Autumn Wind' danced by Lady Jōkyōden's
LINE 100: son[7] who was still a mere child. The remaining performances
LINE 101: attracted little attention, for the audience had had its fill of
LINE 102: wonders and felt that whatever followed could but spoil the
LINE 103: recollection of what had gone before.
LINE 104: That night Genji was promoted to the First Class of the Third Rank and
LINE 105: Tō no Chūjō was promoted to intermediate standing between the First
LINE 106: and Second Classes of the Fourth Rank. The gentlemen of the court were
LINE 107: all promoted one rank. But though they celebrated their good fortune
LINE 108: with the usual rejoicings they were well aware that they had only been
LINE 109: dragged in Genji's wake and wondered how it was that their destinies
LINE 110: had come to be linked in this curious way with those of the prince who
LINE 111: had brought them this unexpected piece of good fortune.
LINE 112: Fujitsubo now retired to her own house and Genji, waiting about for a
LINE 113: chance of visiting her, was seldom at the Great Hall and was
LINE 114: consequently in very ill odour there. It was soon after this that he
LINE 115: brought the child Murasaki to live with him. Aoi heard a rumour of
LINE 116: this, but it reached her merely in the form that someone was living
LINE 117: with him at his palace and she did not know that it was a child. Under
LINE 118: these circumstances it was quite natural that she should feel much
LINE 119: aggrieved. But if only she had flown into an honest passion and abused
LINE 120: him for it as most people would have done, he would have told her
LINE 121: everything and put matters right. As it was, she only redoubled her
LINE 122: icy aloofness and thus led him to seek those very distractions of
LINE 123: which it was intended as a rebuke. Not only was her beauty so flawless
LINE 124: that it could not fail to win his admiration, but also the mere fact
LINE 125: that he had known her since so long ago, before all the rest, made him
LINE 126: feel towards her a tenderness of which she seemed quite unaware. He
LINE 127: was convinced however that her nature was not at bottom narrow and
LINE 128: vindictive, and this gave him some hope that she would one day relent.
LINE 129: Meanwhile as he got to know little Murasaki better he became the more
LINE 130: content both with her appearance and her character. She at least gave
LINE 131: him her whole heart. For the present he did not intend to reveal her
LINE 132: identity even to the servants in his own palace. She continued to
LINE 133: use the somewhat outlying western wing which had now been put into
LINE 134: excellent order, and here Genji constantly came to see her. He gave
LINE 135: her all kinds of lessons, writing exercises for her to copy and
LINE 136: treating her in every way as though she were a little daughter who had
LINE 137: been brought up by foster-parents, but had now come to live with him.
LINE 138: He chose her servants with great care and gave orders that they should
LINE 139: do everything in their power to make her comfortable; but no one
LINE 140: except Koremitsu knew who the child was or how she came to be living
LINE 141: there. Nor had her father discovered what had become of her.
LINE 142: The little girl still sometimes thought of the past and then she would
LINE 143: feel for a while very lonely without her grandmother. When Genji was
LINE 144: there she forgot her sorrow; but in the evening he was very seldom at
LINE 145: home. She was sorry that he was so busy and when he hurried every
LINE 146: evening to some strange place or other she missed him terribly; but
LINE 147: she was never angry with him. Sometimes for two or three days on end
LINE 148: he would be at the Palace or the Great Hall and when he returned he
LINE 149: would find her very tearful and depressed. Then he felt just as though
LINE 150: he were neglecting some child of his own, whose mother had died and
LINE 151: left it in his keeping, and for a while he grew uneasy about his night
LINE 152: excursions.
LINE 153: The priest was puzzled when he heard that Genji had taken Murasaki to
LINE 154: live with him, but saw no harm in it and was delighted that she should
LINE 155: be so well cared for. He was gratified too when Genji begged that the
LINE 156: services in the dead nun's memory should be celebrated with special
LINE 157: pomp and magnificence.
LINE 158: When he went to Fujitsubo's palace, anxious to see for himself whether
LINE 159: she was keeping her health, he was met by a posse of waiting-women
LINE 160: (Myōbus, Chūnagons, Nakatsukasas and the like) and Fujitsubo
LINE 161: herself showed, to his great disappointment, no sign of appearing.
LINE 162: They gave a good account of her, which somewhat allayed his anxiety,
LINE 163: and had passed on to general gossip when it was announced that Prince
LINE 164: Hyōbukyō[8] had arrived. Genji at once went out to speak to him. This
LINE 165: time Genji thought him extremely handsome and there was a softness, a
LINE 166: caressing quality in his manner (Genji was watching him more closely
LINE 167: than he knew) which was feminine enough to make his connection with
LINE 168: Fujitsubo and Murasaki at once uppermost in the mind of his observer.
LINE 169: It was, then, as the brother of the one and the father of the other
LINE 170: that the new-comer at once created a feeling of intimacy, and they had
LINE 171: a long conversation. Hyōbukyō could not fail to notice that Genji was
LINE 172: suddenly treating him with an affection which he had never displayed
LINE 173: before. He was naturally very much gratified, not realizing that Genji
LINE 174: had now, in a sense, become his son-in-law. It was getting late and
LINE 175: Hyōbukyō was about to join his sister in another room. It was with
LINE 176: bitterness that Genji remembered how long ago the Emperor had brought
LINE 177: her to play with him. In those days he ran in and out of her room just
LINE 178: as he chose; now he could not address her save in precarious messages.
LINE 179: She was as inaccessible, as remote as one person conceivably could be
LINE 180: from another, and finding the situation intolerable, he said politely
LINE 181: to Prince Hyōbukyō: 'I wish I saw you more often; unless there is some
LINE 182: special reason for seeing people, I am lazy about it. But if you ever
LINE 183: felt inclined to send for me, I should be delighted ...' and he
LINE 184: hurried away.
LINE 185: Ōmyōbu, the gentlewoman who had contrived Genji's meeting with
LINE 186: Fujitsubo, seeing her mistress relapse into a steady gloom and vexed
LINE 187: at her belated caution was all the time doing her best to bring the
LINE 188: lovers together again; but days and months went by and still all
LINE 189: her efforts were in vain; while they, poor souls, strove desperately
LINE 190: to put away from them this love that was a perpetual disaster.
LINE 191: At Genji's palace Shōnagon, the little girl's nurse, finding herself
LINE 192: in a world of unimagined luxuries and amenities, could only attribute
LINE 193: this good fortune to the success of the late nun's prayers. The Lord
LINE 194: Buddha to whose protection the dying lady had so fervently recommended
LINE 195: her grand-daughter had indeed made handsome provision for her. There
LINE 196: were of course certain disadvantages. The haughtiness of Aoi was not
LINE 197: only in itself to be feared, but it seemed to have the consequence of
LINE 198: driving Prince Genji to seek distractions right and left, which would
LINE 199: be very unpleasant for the little princess so soon as she was old
LINE 200: enough to realize it. Yet so strong a preference did he show for the
LINE 201: child's company that Shōnagon did not altogether lose heart.
LINE 202: It being then three months since her grandmother died Murasaki came
LINE 203: out of mourning at the end of the Godless Month. But it was thought
LINE 204: proper since she was to be brought up as an orphan that she should
LINE 205: still avoid patterned stuffs, and she wore a little tunic of plain
LINE 206: red, brown or yellow, in which she nevertheless looked very smart and
LINE 207: gay.
LINE 208: He came to have a look at her before going off to the New Year's Day
LINE 209: reception at Court. 'From to-day onwards you are a grown-up lady,' he
LINE 210: said, and as he stood smiling at her he looked so charming and
LINE 211: friendly that she could not bear him to go, and hoping that he would
LINE 212: stay and play with her a little while longer she got out her toys.
LINE 213: There was a doll's kitchen only three feet high but fitted out with
LINE 214: all the proper utensils, and a whole collection of little houses which
LINE 215: Genji had made for her. Now she had got them all spread out over the
LINE 216: floor so that it was difficult to move without treading on them.
LINE 217: 'Little Inu broke them yesterday,' she explained 'when he was
LINE 218: pretending to drive out the Old Year's demons, and I am mending them.'
LINE 219: She was evidently in great trouble. 'What a tiresome child he is,'
LINE 220: said Genji. 'I will get them mended for you. Come, you must not cry on
LINE 221: New Year's Day,' and he went out. Many of the servants had collected
LINE 222: at the end of the corridor to see him starting out for the Court in
LINE 223: all his splendour. Murasaki too went out and watched him. When she
LINE 224: came back she put a grand dress on one of her dolls and did a
LINE 225: performance with it which she called 'Prince Genji visiting the
LINE 226: Emperor.' 'This year,' said Shōnagon, looking on with disapproval,
LINE 227: 'you must really try not to be such a baby. It is time little girls
LINE 228: stopped playing with dolls when they are ten years old, and now that
LINE 229: you have got a kind gentleman wanting to be your husband you ought to
LINE 230: try and show him that you can behave like a nice little grown-up lady
LINE 231: or he will get tired of waiting.' She said this because she thought
LINE 232: that it must be painful for Genji to see the child still so intent
LINE 233: upon her games and be thus reminded that she was a mere baby. Her
LINE 234: admonishment had the effect of making Murasaki for the first time
LINE 235: aware that Genji was to be her husband. She knew all about husbands.
LINE 236: Many of the maid-servants had them, but such ugly ones! She was very
LINE 237: glad that hers was so much younger and handsomer. Nevertheless the
LINE 238: mere fact that she thought about the matter at all showed that she was
LINE 239: beginning to grow up a little. Her childish ways and appearance were
LINE 240: by no means so great a misfortune as Shōnagon supposed, for they went
LINE 241: a long way towards allaying the suspicions which the child's presence
LINE 242: might otherwise have aroused in Genji's somewhat puzzled household.
LINE 243: When he returned from Court he went straight to the Great Hall. Aoi
LINE 244: was as perfect as ever, and just as unfriendly. This never failed to
LINE 245: wound Genji. 'If only you had changed with the New Year, had
LINE 246: become a little less cold and forbidding, how happy I should be!' he
LINE 247: exclaimed. But she had heard that someone was living with him and had
LINE 248: at once made up her mind that she herself had been utterly supplanted
LINE 249: and put aside. Hence she was more sullen than ever; but he pretended
LINE 250: not to notice it and by his gaiety and gentleness at last induced
LINE 251: her to answer when he spoke. Was it her being four years older
LINE 252: than him that made her seem so unapproachable, so exasperatingly
LINE 253: well-regulated? But that was not fair. What fault could he possibly
LINE 254: find in her? She was perfect in every respect and he realized that if
LINE 255: she was sometimes out of humour this was solely the result of his own
LINE 256: irregularities. She was after all the daughter of a Minister, and of
LINE 257: the Minister who above all others enjoyed the greatest influence and
LINE 258: esteem. She was the only child of the Emperor's sister and had been
LINE 259: brought up with a full sense of her own dignity and importance. The
LINE 260: least slight, the merest hint of disrespect came to her as a complete
LINE 261: surprise. To Genji all these pretensions naturally seemed somewhat
LINE 262: exaggerated and his failure to make allowances for them increased her
LINE 263: hostility.
LINE 264: Aoi's father was vexed by Genji's seeming fickleness, but so soon as
LINE 265: he was with him he forgot all his grievances and was always extremely
LINE 266: nice to him. When Genji was leaving next day his father-in-law came to
LINE 267: his room and helped him to dress, bringing in his own hands a belt
LINE 268: which was an heirloom famous far and wide. He pulled straight the back
LINE 269: of Genji's robe which had become a little crumpled, and indeed short
LINE 270: of bringing him his shoes performed in the friendliest way every
LINE 271: possible small service. 'This,' said Genji handing back the belt, 'is
LINE 272: for Imperial banquets or other great occasions of that kind.' 'I have
LINE 273: others much more valuable,' said the Minister, 'which I will give you
LINE 274: for the Imperial banquets. This one is not of much account save
LINE 275: that the workmanship of it is rather unusual,' and despite Genji's
LINE 276: protests he insisted upon buckling it round him. The performance of
LINE 277: such services was his principal interest in life. What did it matter
LINE 278: if Genji was rather irregular in his visits? To have so agreeable a
LINE 279: young man going in and out of one's house at all was the greatest
LINE 280: pleasure he could imagine.
LINE 281: Genji did not pay many New Year's visits. First he went to the
LINE 282: Emperor, then the Heir Apparent and the Ex-Emperor, and after that to
LINE 283: Princess Fujitsubo's house in the Third Ward. As they saw him enter
LINE 284: the servants of the house noticed how much he had grown and altered in
LINE 285: the last year. 'Look how he has filled out,' they said, 'even since
LINE 286: his last visit!' Of the Princess herself he was only allowed a distant
LINE 287: glimpse. It gave him many forebodings. Her child had been expected in
LINE 288: the twelfth month and her condition was now causing some anxiety. That
LINE 289: it would at any rate be born some time during the first weeks of the
LINE 290: New Year was confidently assumed by her own people and had been stated
LINE 291: at Court. But the first month went by and still nothing happened. It
LINE 292: began to be rumoured that she was suffering from some kind of
LINE 293: possession or delusion. She herself grew very depressed; she felt
LINE 294: certain that when the event at last happened she would not survive it
LINE 295: and she worried so much about herself that she became seriously ill.
LINE 296: The delay made Genji more certain than ever of his own responsibility
LINE 297: and he arranged secretly for prayers on her behalf to be said in all
LINE 298: the great temples. He had already become firmly convinced that
LINE 299: whatever might happen concerning the child Fujitsubo was herself
LINE 300: utterly doomed when he heard that about the tenth day of the second
LINE 301: month she had successfully given birth to a boy. The news brought
LINE 302: great satisfaction both to the Emperor and the whole court.
LINE 303: The Emperor's fervent prayers for her life and for that of a child
LINE 304: which she knew was not his, distressed and embarrassed her; whereas,
LINE 305: when the maliciously gloomy prognostications of Kōkiden and the rest
LINE 306: were brought to her notice, she was at once filled with a perverse
LINE 307: desire to disappoint their hopes and make them look ridiculous in the
LINE 308: eyes of those to whom they had confided their forebodings. By a great
LINE 309: effort of will she threw off the despair which had been weighing down
LINE 310: upon her and began little by little to recover her usual vigour.
LINE 311: The Emperor was impatient to see Fujitsubo's child and so too (though
LINE 312: he was forced to conceal his interest in the matter) was Genji
LINE 313: himself. Accordingly he went to her palace when there were not many
LINE 314: people about and sent in a note offering as the Emperor was in such a
LINE 315: state of impatience to see the child and etiquette forbade him to do
LINE 316: so for several weeks, to look at the child himself and report upon its
LINE 317: appearance to the Emperor. She replied that she would rather he saw it
LINE 318: on a day when it was less peevish; but in reality her refusal had
LINE 319: nothing to do with the state of the child's temper; she could not bear
LINE 320: the idea of his seeing it at all. Already it bore an astonishing
LINE 321: resemblance to him; of that she was convinced. Always there lurked in
LINE 322: her heart the torturing demon of fear. Soon others would see the child
LINE 323: and instantly know with absolute certainty the secret of her swift
LINE 324: transgression. What charity towards such a crime as this would a world
LINE 325: have that gossips if a single hair is awry? Such thoughts continually
LINE 326: tormented her and she again became weary of her life.
LINE 327: From time to time he saw Ōmyōbu, but though he still implored her to
LINE 328: arrange a meeting none of his many arguments availed him. He also
LINE 329: pestered her with so many questions about the child that she exclaimed
LINE 330: at last: 'Why do you go on plaguing me like this? You will be
LINE 331: seeing him for yourself soon, when he is shown at Court.' But though
LINE 332: she spoke impatiently she knew quite well what he was suffering and
LINE 333: felt for him deeply. The matter was not one which he could discuss
LINE 334: except with Fujitsubo herself, and it was impossible to see her. Would
LINE 335: he indeed ever again see her alone or communicate with her save
LINE 336: through notes and messengers? And half-weeping with despair he recited
LINE 337: the verse: 'What guilty intercourse must ours have been in some life
LINE 338: long ago, that now so cruel a barrier should be set between us?'
LINE 339: Ōmyōbu seeing that it cost her mistress a great struggle to do without
LINE 340: him was at pains not to dismiss him too unkindly and answered with the
LINE 341: verse: 'Should you see the child my lady would be in torment; and
LINE 342: because you have not seen it you are full of lamentations. Truly have
LINE 343: children been called a black darkness that leads the parents' heart
LINE 344: astray!' And coming closer she whispered to him 'Poor souls, it is a
LINE 345: hard fate that has overtaken you both.' Thus many times and again he
LINE 346: returned to his house desperate. Fujitsubo meanwhile, fearing lest
LINE 347: Genji's continual visits should attract notice, began to suspect that
LINE 348: Ōmyōbu was secretly encouraging him and no longer felt the same
LINE 349: affection for her. She did not want this to be noticed and tried to
LINE 350: treat her just as usual; but her irritation was bound sometimes to
LINE 351: betray itself and Ōmyōbu, feeling that her mistress was estranged from
LINE 352: her and at a loss to find any reason for it, was very miserable.
LINE 353: It was not till its fourth month that the child was brought to the
LINE 354: Palace. It was large for its age and had already begun to take a great
LINE 355: interest in what went on around it. Its extraordinary resemblance to
LINE 356: Genji was not remarked upon by the Emperor who had an idea that
LINE 357: handsome children were all very much alike at that age. He became
LINE 358: intensely devoted to the child and lavished every kind of care and
LINE 359: attention upon it. For Genji himself he had always had so great a
LINE 360: partiality that, had it not been for popular opposition, he would
LINE 361: certainly have installed him as Heir Apparent. That he had not been
LINE 362: able to do so constantly distressed him. To have produced so
LINE 363: magnificent a son and be obliged to watch him growing up a mere
LINE 364: nobleman had always been galling to him. Now in his old age a son had
LINE 365: been born to him who promised to be equally handsome and had not the
LINE 366: tiresome disadvantage of a plebeian mother, and upon this flawless
LINE 367: pearl he expended his whole affection. The mother saw little chance of
LINE 368: this rapture continuing and was all this while in a state of agonized
LINE 369: apprehension.
LINE 370: One day, when as he had been wont to do before, Genji was making music
LINE 371: for her at the Emperor's command, His Majesty took the child in his
LINE 372: arms saying to Genji: 'I have had many children, but you were the only
LINE 373: other one that I ever behaved about in this fashion. It may be my
LINE 374: fancy, but it seems to me this child is exactly like what you were at
LINE 375: the same age. However, I suppose all babies are very much alike while
LINE 376: they are as small as this,' and he looked at the fine child with
LINE 377: admiration. A succession of violent emotions—terror, shame, pride and
LINE 378: love—passed through Genji's breast while these words were being
LINE 379: spoken, and were reflected in his rapidly changing colour. He was
LINE 380: almost in tears. The child looked so exquisitely beautiful as it lay
LINE 381: crowing to itself and smiling that, hideous as the situation was,
LINE 382: Genji could not help feeling glad it was thought to be like him.
LINE 383: Fujitsubo meanwhile was in a state of embarrassment and agitation so
LINE 384: painful that a cold sweat broke out upon her while she sat by. For
LINE 385: Genji this jarring of opposite emotions was too much to be borne and
LINE 386: he went home. Here he lay tossing on his bed and, unable to
LINE 387: distract himself, he determined after a while to go to the Great Hall.
LINE 388: As he passed by the flower-beds in front of his house he noticed that
LINE 389: a faint tinge of green was already filming the bushes and under them
LINE 390: the _tokonatsu_[9] were already in bloom. He plucked one and sent it
LINE 391: to Ōmyōbu with a long letter and an acrostic poem in which he said
LINE 392: that he was touched by the likeness of this flower to the child, but
LINE 393: also hinted that he was perturbed by the child's likeness to himself.
LINE 394: 'In this flower,' he continued despondently, 'I had hoped to see your
LINE 395: beauty enshrined. But now I know that being mine yet not mine it can
LINE 396: bring me no comfort to look upon it.' After waiting a little while
LINE 397: till a favourable moment should arise Ōmyōbu showed her mistress the
LINE 398: letter, saying with a sigh 'I fear that your answer will be but dust
LINE 399: to the petals of this thirsting flower.' But Fujitsubo, in whose heart
LINE 400: also the new spring was awakening a host of tender thoughts, wrote in
LINE 401: answer the poem: 'Though it alone be the cause that these poor sleeves
LINE 402: are wet with dew, yet goes my heart still with it, this child-flower
LINE 403: of Yamato Land.' This was all and it was roughly scribbled in a faint
LINE 404: hand, but it was a comfort to Ōmyōbu to have even such a message as
LINE 405: this to bring back. Genji knew quite well that it could lead to
LINE 406: nothing. How many times had she sent him such messages before! Yet as
LINE 407: he lay dejectedly gazing at the note, the mere sight of her
LINE 408: handwriting soon stirred in him a frenzy of unreasoning excitement and
LINE 409: delight. For a while he lay restlessly tossing on his bed. At last
LINE 410: unable to remain any longer inactive he sprang up and went, as he had
LINE 411: so often done before, to the western wing to seek distraction from the
LINE 412: agitated thoughts which pursued him. He came towards the women's
LINE 413: apartments with his hair loose upon his shoulders, wearing a queer
LINE 414: dressing-gown and, in order to amuse Murasaki, playing a tune on
LINE 415: his flute as he walked. He peeped in at the door. She looked as she
LINE 416: lay there for all the world like the fresh dewy flower that he had so
LINE 417: recently plucked. She was growing a little bit spoilt and having heard
LINE 418: some while ago that he had returned from Court she was rather cross
LINE 419: with him for not coming to see her at once. She did not run to meet
LINE 420: him as she usually did, but lay with her head turned away. He called
LINE 421: to her from the far side of the room to get up and come to him, but
LINE 422: she did not stir. Suddenly he heard that she was murmuring to herself
LINE 423: the lines 'Like a sea-flower that the waters have covered when a great
LINE 424: tide mounts the shore.' They were from an old poem[10] that he had
LINE 425: taught her, in which a lady complains that she is neglected by her
LINE 426: lover. She looked bewitching as she lay with her face half-sullenly,
LINE 427: half-coquettishly buried in her sleeve. 'How naughty,' he cried.
LINE 428: 'Really you are becoming too witty. But if you saw me more often
LINE 429: perhaps you would grow tired of me.' Then he sent for his zithern and
LINE 430: asked her to play to him. But it was a big Chinese instrument[11] with
LINE 431: thirteen strings; the five slender strings in the middle embarrassed
LINE 432: her and she could not get the full sound out of them. Taking it from
LINE 433: her he shifted the bridge, and tuning it to a lower pitch played a few
LINE 434: chords upon it and bade her try again. Her sullen mood was over. She
LINE 435: began to play very prettily; sometimes, when there was a gap too long
LINE 436: for one small hand to stretch, helping herself out so adroitly with
LINE 437: the other hand that Genji was completely captivated and taking up his
LINE 438: flute taught her a number of new tunes. She was very quick and grasped
LINE 439: the most complicated rhythms at a single hearing. She had indeed in
LINE 440: music as in all else just those talents with which it most delighted
LINE 441: him that she should be endowed. When he played the Hosoroguseri (which
LINE 442: in spite of its absurd name is an excellent tune) she accompanied
LINE 443: him though with a childish touch, yet in perfect time.
LINE 444: The great lamp was brought in and they began looking at pictures
LINE 445: together. But Genji was going out that night. Already his attendants
LINE 446: were assembled in the courtyard outside. One of them was saying that a
LINE 447: storm was coming on. He ought not to wait any longer. Again Murasaki
LINE 448: was unhappy. She was not looking at the pictures, but sat with her
LINE 449: head on her hands staring despondently at the floor. Stroking the
LINE 450: lovely hair that had fallen forward across her lap Genji asked her if
LINE 451: she missed him when he was away. She nodded. 'I am just the same,' he
LINE 452: said. 'If I miss seeing you for a single day I am terribly unhappy.
LINE 453: But you are only a little girl and I know that whatever I do you will
LINE 454: not think harsh thoughts about me; while the lady that I go to see is
LINE 455: very jealous and angry so that it would break her heart if I were to
LINE 456: stay with you too long. But I do not at all like being there and that
LINE 457: is why I just go for a little while like this. When you are grown up
LINE 458: of course I shall never go away at all. I only go now because if I did
LINE 459: not she would be so terribly angry with me that I might very likely
LINE 460: die[12] and then there would be no one to love you and take care of
LINE 461: you at all.' He had told her all he could, but still she was offended
LINE 462: and would not answer a word. At last he took her on his knee and here
LINE 463: to his great embarrassment she fell asleep. 'It is too late to go out
LINE 464: now,' he said after a while, turning to the gentlewomen who were in
LINE 465: attendance. They rose and went to fetch his supper. He roused the
LINE 466: child. 'Look,' he said, 'I did not go out after all.' She was happy
LINE 467: once more and they went to supper together. She liked the queer,
LINE 468: irregular meal, but when it was over she began again to watch him
LINE 469: uneasily. 'If you are really not going out,' she said, 'why do
LINE 470: you not go to sleep at once?' Leaving her at such a moment to go back
LINE 471: to his room he felt all the reluctance of one who is setting out upon
LINE 472: a long and perilous journey.
LINE 473: It constantly happened that at the last minute he thus decided to stay
LINE 474: with her. It was natural that some report of his new pre-occupation
LINE 475: should leak out into the world and be passed on to the Great Hall.
LINE 476: 'Who can it be?' said one of Aoi's ladies. 'It is really the most
LINE 477: inexplicable business. How can he have suddenly become entirely
LINE 478: wrapped up in someone whom we had never heard the existence of before?
LINE 479: It cannot in any case be a person of much breeding or self-respect. It
LINE 480: is probably some girl employed at the Palace whom he has taken to live
LINE 481: with him in order that the affair may be hushed up. No doubt he is
LINE 482: circulating the story that she is a child merely in order to put us
LINE 483: off the scent.' And this opinion was shared by the rest.
LINE 484: The Emperor too had heard that there was someone living with Genji and
LINE 485: thought it a great pity. 'You are treating the Minister very badly,'
LINE 486: he said. 'He has shown the greatest possible devotion to you ever
LINE 487: since you were a mere baby and now that you are old enough to know
LINE 488: better you behave like this towards him and his family! It is really
LINE 489: most ungrateful.'
LINE 490: Genji listened respectfully, but made no reply. The Emperor began to
LINE 491: fear that his marriage with Aoi had proved a very unhappy one and was
LINE 492: sorry that he had arranged it. 'I do not understand you,' he said.
LINE 493: 'You seem to have no taste for gallantry and do not, so far as I can
LINE 494: see, take the slightest interest in any of the ladies-in-waiting whom
LINE 495: one might expect you to find attractive, nor do you bother yourself
LINE 496: about the various beauties who in one part of the town or another are
LINE 497: now in request; but instead you must needs pick up some creature from
LINE 498: no one knows where and wound the feelings of others by keeping
LINE 499: her as your mistress!'
LINE 500: Though he was now getting on in years the Emperor had himself by no
LINE 501: means ceased to be interested in such matters. He had always seen to
LINE 502: it that his ladies-in-waiting and palace-servants should be remarkable
LINE 503: both for their looks and their intelligence, and it was a time when
LINE 504: the Court was full of interesting women. There were few among them
LINE 505: whom Genji could not by the slightest word or gesture have made his
LINE 506: own. But, perhaps because he saw too much of them, he did not find
LINE 507: them in the least attractive. Suspecting this, they would occasionally
LINE 508: experiment upon him with some frivolous remark. He answered so staidly
LINE 509: that they saw a flirtation would be impossible and some of them came
LINE 510: to the conclusion that he was rather a dull, prudish young man.
LINE 511: There was an elderly lady-of-the-bedchamber who, though she was an
LINE 512: excellent creature in every other way and was very much liked and
LINE 513: respected, was an outrageous flirt. It astonished Genji that despite
LINE 514: her advancing years she showed no sign of reforming her reckless and
LINE 515: fantastic behaviour. Curious to see how she would take it he one day
LINE 516: came up and began joking with her. She appeared to be quite
LINE 517: unconscious of the disparity between their ages and at once counted
LINE 518: him as an admirer. Slightly alarmed, he nevertheless found her company
LINE 519: rather agreeable and often talked with her. But, chiefly because he
LINE 520: was frightened of being laughed at if anyone found out, he refused to
LINE 521: become her lover, and this she very much resented. One day she was
LINE 522: dressing the Emperor's hair. When this was over his Majesty sent for
LINE 523: his valets and went with them into another room. Genji and the elderly
LINE 524: lady were left alone together. She was fuller than ever of languishing
LINE 525: airs and poses, and her costume was to the last degree stylish and
LINE 526: elaborate. 'Poor creature,' he thought, 'How little difference it
LINE 527: all makes!' and he was passing her on his way out of the room when
LINE 528: suddenly the temptation to give a tug at her dress became
LINE 529: irresistible. She glanced swiftly round, eyeing him above the rim of a
LINE 530: marvellously painted summer-fan. The eyelids beneath which she ogled
LINE 531: at him were blackened and sunken; wisps of hair projected untidily
LINE 532: around her forehead. There was something singularly inappropriate
LINE 533: about this gawdy, coquettish fan. Handing her his own instead, he took
LINE 534: it from her and examined it. On paper coated with a red so thick and
LINE 535: lustrous that you could see yourself reflected in it a forest of tall
LINE 536: trees was painted in gold. At the side of this design, in a hand which
LINE 537: though out-of-date was not lacking in distinction was written the poem
LINE 538: about the Forest of Oaraki.[13] He made no doubt that the owner of the
LINE 539: fan had written it in allusion to her own advancing years and was
LINE 540: expecting him to make a gallant reply. Turning over in his mind how
LINE 541: best to divert the extravagant ardour of this strange creature he
LINE 542: could, to his own amusement, think only of another poem[14] about the
LINE 543: same forest; but to this it would have been ill-bred to allude. He was
LINE 544: feeling very uncomfortable lest someone should come in and see them
LINE 545: together. She however was quite at her ease and seeing that he
LINE 546: remained silent she recited with many arch looks the poem: 'Come to me
LINE 547: in the forest and I will cut pasture for your horse, though it be but
LINE 548: of the under leaf whose season is past.' 'Should I seek your
LINE 549: woodland,' he answered, 'my fair name would be gone, for down its
LINE 550: glades at all times the pattering of hoofs is heard,' and he tried to
LINE 551: get away; but she held him back saying: 'How odious you are! That is
LINE 552: not what I mean at all. No one has ever insulted me like this
LINE 553: before,' and she burst into tears. 'Let us talk about it some other
LINE 554: time,' said Genji; 'I did not mean ...' and freeing himself from her
LINE 555: grasp he rushed out of the room, leaving her in great dudgeon. She
LINE 556: felt indeed after his repulse prodigiously old and tottering. All this
LINE 557: was seen by His Majesty who, his toilet long ago completed, had
LINE 558: watched the ill-assorted pair with great amusement from behind his
LINE 559: Imperial screen. 'I am always being told,' he said, 'that the boy
LINE 560: takes no interest in the members of my household. But I cannot say
LINE 561: that he seems to me unduly shy,' and he laughed. For a moment she was
LINE 562: slightly embarrassed; but she felt that any relationship with Genji,
LINE 563: even if it consisted of being rebuffed by him in public, was
LINE 564: distinctly a feather in her cap, and she made no attempt to defend
LINE 565: herself against the Emperor's raillery. The story soon went the round
LINE 566: of the Court. It astonished no one more than Tō no Chūjō who, though
LINE 567: he knew that Genji was given to odd experiments, could not believe
LINE 568: that his friend was really launched upon the fantastic courtship which
LINE 569: rumour was attributing to him. There seemed no better way of
LINE 570: discovering whether it was conceivably possible to regard the lady in
LINE 571: such a light than to make love to her himself.
LINE 572: The attentions of so distinguished a suitor went a long way towards
LINE 573: consoling her for her late discomfiture. Her new intrigue was of
LINE 574: course carried on with absolute secrecy and Genji knew nothing about
LINE 575: it. When he next met her she seemed to be very cross with him, and
LINE 576: feeling sorry for her because she was so old he made up his mind that
LINE 577: he must try to console her. But for a long while he was completely
LINE 578: occupied by tiresome business of one kind and another. At last one
LINE 579: very dismal rainy evening when he was strolling in the neighbourhood
LINE 580: of the Ummeiden[15] he heard this lady playing most agreeably on
LINE 581: her lute. She was so good a performer that she was often called upon
LINE 582: to play with the professional male musicians in the Imperial
LINE 583: orchestra. It happened that at this moment she was somewhat downcast
LINE 584: and discontented, and in such a mood she played with even greater
LINE 585: feeling and verve. She was singing the 'Melon-grower's Song'[16];
LINE 586: admirably, he thought, despite its inappropriateness to her age. So
LINE 587: must the voice of the mysterious lady at O-chou have sounded in Po
LINE 588: Chü-i's ears when he heard her singing on her boat at night[17]; and
LINE 589: he stood listening. At the end of the song the player sighed heavily
LINE 590: as though quite worn out by the passionate vehemence of her serenade.
LINE 591: Genji approached softly humming the 'Azumaya': 'Here in the portico of
LINE 592: the eastern house rain splashes on me while I wait. Come, my beloved,
LINE 593: open the door and let me in.' Immediately, indeed with an unseemly
LINE 594: haste, she answered as does the lady in the song 'Open the door and
LINE 595: come in,'[18] adding the verse: 'In the wide shelter of that portico
LINE 596: no man yet was ever splashed with rain,' and again she sighed so
LINE 597: portentously that although he did not at all suppose that he alone was
LINE 598: the cause of this demonstration he felt it in any case to be somewhat
LINE 599: exaggerated and answered with the poem: 'Your sighs show clearly that,
LINE 600: despite the song, you are another's bride, and I for my part have no
LINE 601: mind to haunt the loggias of your eastern house.' He would gladly have
LINE 602: passed on, but he felt that this would be too unkind, and seeing that
LINE 603: someone else was coming towards her room he stepped inside and
LINE 604: began talking lightly of indifferent subjects, in a style which though
LINE 605: it was in reality somewhat forced she found very entertaining.
LINE 606: It was intolerable, thought Tō no Chūjō, that Genji should be praised
LINE 607: as a quiet and serious young man and should constantly rebuke him for
LINE 608: his frivolity, while all the time he was carrying on a multiplicity of
LINE 609: interesting intrigues which out of mere churlishness he kept entirely
LINE 610: hidden from all his friends. For a long while Chūjō had been waiting
LINE 611: for an opportunity to expose this sanctimonious imposture, and when he
LINE 612: saw Genji enter the gentlewoman's apartment you may be sure he was
LINE 613: delighted. To scare him a little at such a moment would be an
LINE 614: excellent way to punish him for his unfriendliness. He slackened his
LINE 615: pace and watched. The wind sighed in the trees. It was getting very
LINE 616: late. Surely Genji would soon begin to doze? And indeed he did now
LINE 617: look as though he had fallen asleep. Chūjō stole on tip-toe into the
LINE 618: room; but Genji who was only half dreaming instantly heard him, and
LINE 619: not knowing that Chūjō had followed him got it into his head that it
LINE 620: was a certain Commissioner of Works who years ago had been supposed to
LINE 621: be an admirer of the lady. The idea of being discovered in such a
LINE 622: situation by this important old gentleman filled him with horror.
LINE 623: Furious with his companion for having exposed him to the chance of
LINE 624: such a predicament: 'This is too bad,' he whispered 'I am going home.
LINE 625: What possessed you to let me in on a night when you knew that someone
LINE 626: else was coming?' He had only time to snatch up his cloak and hide
LINE 627: behind a long folding screen before Chūjō entered the room and going
LINE 628: straight up to the screen began in a business-like manner to fold it
LINE 629: up. Though she was no longer young the lady did not lose her head in
LINE 630: this alarming crisis. Being a woman of fashion she had on more than
LINE 631: one occasion found herself in an equally agitating position, and
LINE 632: now despite her astonishment, after considering for a moment what had
LINE 633: best be done with the intruder, she seized him by the back of his coat
LINE 634: and with a practised though trembling hand pulled him away from the
LINE 635: screen. Genji had still no idea that it was Chūjō. He had half a mind
LINE 636: to show himself, but quickly remembered that he was oddly and
LINE 637: inadequately clad, with his head-dress all awry. He felt that if he
LINE 638: ran for it he would cut much too strange a figure as he left the room,
LINE 639: and for a moment he hesitated. Wondering how much longer Genji would
LINE 640: take to recognize him Chūjō did not say a word but putting on the most
LINE 641: ferocious air imaginable drew his sword from the scabbard. Whereupon
LINE 642: the lady crying 'Gentlemen! Gentlemen!' flung herself between them in
LINE 643: an attitude of romantic supplication. They could hardly refrain from
LINE 644: bursting into laughter. It was only by day when very carefully painted
LINE 645: and bedizened that she still retained a certain superficial air of
LINE 646: youth and charm. But now this woman of fifty-seven or eight, disturbed
LINE 647: by a sudden brawl in the midst of her amours, created the most
LINE 648: astonishing spectacle as she knelt at the feet of two young men in
LINE 649: their 'teens beseeching them not to die for her. Chūjō however
LINE 650: refrained from showing the slightest sign of amusement and continued
LINE 651: to look as alarming and ferocious as he could. But he was now in full
LINE 652: view and Genji realized in a moment that Chūjō had all the while known
LINE 653: who he was and had been amusing himself at his expense. Much relieved
LINE 654: at this discovery he grabbed at the scabbard from which Chūjō had
LINE 655: drawn the sword and held it fast lest his friend should attempt to
LINE 656: escape and then, despite his annoyance at having been followed, burst
LINE 657: into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. 'Are you in your right mind?'
LINE 658: said Genji at last. 'This is really a very poor sort of joke. Do you
LINE 659: mind letting me get into my cloak?' Whereupon Chūjō snatched the
LINE 660: cloak from him and would not give it back. 'Very well then,' said
LINE 661: Genji; 'if you are to have my cloak I must have yours,' and so saying
LINE 662: he pulled open the clasp of Chūjō's belt and began tugging his cloak
LINE 663: from his shoulders. Chūjō resisted and a long tussle followed in which
LINE 664: the cloak was torn to shreds. 'Should you now get it in exchange for
LINE 665: yours, this tattered cloak will but reveal the secrets it is meant to
LINE 666: hide,' recited Tō no Chūjō; to which Genji replied with an acrostic
LINE 667: poem in which he complained that Chūjō with whom he shared so many
LINE 668: secrets should have thought it necessary to spy upon him in this
LINE 669: fashion. But neither was really angry with the other and setting their
LINE 670: disordered costumes to rights they both took their departure. Genji
LINE 671: discovered when he was alone that it had indeed upset him very much to
LINE 672: find his movements had been watched, and he could not sleep. The lady
LINE 673: felt utterly bewildered. On the floor she found a belt and a buckle
LINE 674: which she sent to Genji next day with a complicated acrostic poem in
LINE 675: which she compared these stranded properties to the weeds which after
LINE 676: their straining and tugging the waves leave upon the shore. She added
LINE 677: an allusion to the crystal river of her tears. He was irritated by her
LINE 678: persistency but distressed at the shock to which she had been
LINE 679: subjected by Chūjō's foolish joke, and he answered with the poem: 'At
LINE 680: the antics of the prancing wave you have good cause to be angry; but
LINE 681: blameless indeed is the shore on whose sands it lashed.' The belt was
LINE 682: Chūjō's; that was plain for it was darker in colour than his own
LINE 683: cloak. And as he examined his cloak he noticed that the lower half of
LINE 684: one sleeve was torn away. What a mess everything was in! He told
LINE 685: himself with disgust that he was becoming a rowdy, a vulgar
LINE 686: night-brawler. Such people, he knew, were always tearing their clothes
LINE 687: and making themselves ridiculous. It was time to reform.
LINE 688: The missing sleeve soon arrived from Chūjō's apartments with the
LINE 689: message: 'Had you not better have this sewn on before you wear your
LINE 690: cloak?' How had he managed to get hold of it? Such tricks were very
LINE 691: tiresome and silly. But he supposed he must now give back the belt,
LINE 692: and wrapping it in paper of the same colour he sent it with a riddling
LINE 693: poem in which he said that he would not keep it lest he should make
LINE 694: trouble between Chūjō and the lady. 'You have dragged her away from me
LINE 695: as in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt,' said Chūjō in his
LINE 696: answering poem, and added 'Have I not good reason to be angry with you?'
LINE 697: Later in the morning they met in the Presence Room. Genji wore a
LINE 698: solemn and abstracted air. Chūjō could not help recollecting the
LINE 699: absurd scene of their last meeting, but it was a day upon which there
LINE 700: was a great deal of public business to dispatch and he was soon
LINE 701: absorbed in his duties. But from time to time each would catch sight
LINE 702: of the other's serious face and heavy official bearing, and then they
LINE 703: could not help smiling. In an interval Chūjō came up to Genji and
LINE 704: asked him in a low voice whether he had decided in future to be a
LINE 705: little more communicative about his affairs. 'No, indeed,' said Genji;
LINE 706: 'but I feel I owe you an apology for preventing you from spending a
LINE 707: happy hour with the lady whom you had come to visit. Everything in
LINE 708: life seems to go wrong.' So they whispered and at the end each
LINE 709: solemnly promised the other not to speak of the matter to anybody. But
LINE 710: to the two of them it furnished a constant supply of jokes for a long
LINE 711: while to come, though Genji took the matter to heart more than he
LINE 712: showed and was determined never to get mixed up with such a tiresome
LINE 713: creature again. He heard however that the lady was still much ruffled,
LINE 714: and fearing that there might be no one at hand to comfort her he had
LINE 715: not the heart quite to discontinue his visits.
LINE 716: Chūjō, faithful to his promise, did not mention the affair to
LINE 717: anyone, not even to his sister, but kept it as a weapon of
LINE 718: self-defence should Genji ever preach high morality to him again.
LINE 719: Such marked preference did the Emperor show in his treatment of Genji
LINE 720: that even the other princes of the Blood Royal stood somewhat in awe
LINE 721: of him. But Tō no Chūjō was ready to dispute with him on any subject,
LINE 722: and was by no means inclined always to let him have his own way. He
LINE 723: and Aoi were the only children of the Emperor's sister. Genji, it is
LINE 724: true, was the Emperor's son; but though Chūjō's father was only a
LINE 725: Minister his influence was far greater than that of his colleagues,
LINE 726: and as the son of such a man by his marriage with a royal princess he
LINE 727: was used to being treated with the greatest deference. It had never so
LINE 728: much as occurred to him that he was in any way Genji's inferior; for
LINE 729: he knew that as regards his person at least he had no reason to be
LINE 730: dissatisfied; and with most other qualities, whether of character or
LINE 731: intelligence, he believed himself to be very adequately endowed. Thus
LINE 732: a friendly rivalry grew up between the two of them and led to many
LINE 733: diverting incidents which it would take too long to describe.
LINE 734: In the seventh month two events of importance took place. An empress
LINE 735: was appointed[18] and Genji was raised to the rank of Counsellor. The
LINE 736: Emperor was intending very soon to resign the Throne. He would have
LINE 737: liked to proclaim his new-born child as Heir Apparent in place of
LINE 738: Kōkiden's son. This was difficult, for there was no political function
LINE 739: which would have supported such a choice. Fujitsubo's relations were
LINE 740: all members of the Imperial family[19] and Genji, to whom he might
LINE 741: have looked for help owing to his affiliation with the Minamoto clan,
LINE 742: unfortunately showed no aptitude for political intrigue. The best
LINE 743: he could do was at any rate to strengthen Fujitsubo's position and
LINE 744: hope that later on she would be able to exert her influence. Kōkiden
LINE 745: heard of his intentions, and small wonder if she was distressed and
LINE 746: astounded. The Emperor tried to quiet her by pointing out that in a
LINE 747: short time her son would succeed to the Throne and that she would then
LINE 748: hold the equally important rank of Empress Mother. But it was indeed
LINE 749: hard that the mother of the Heir Apparent should be passed over in
LINE 750: favour of a concubine aged little more than twenty. The public tended
LINE 751: to take Kōkiden's side and there was a good deal of discontent. On the
LINE 752: night when the new Empress was installed Genji, as a Counsellor, was
LINE 753: among those who accompanied her to the Middle Palace. As daughter of a
LINE 754: previous Empress and mother of an exquisite prince she enjoyed a
LINE 755: consideration at Court beyond that which her new rank would have alone
LINE 756: procured for her. But if it was with admiring devotion that the other
LINE 757: great lords of her train attended her that day, it may be imagined
LINE 758: with what fond yet agonized thoughts Prince Genji followed the litter
LINE 759: in which she rode. She seemed at last to have been raised so far
LINE 760: beyond his reach that scarce knowing what he did he murmured to
LINE 761: himself the lines: 'Now upon love's dark path has the last shadow
LINE 762: closed; for I have seen you carried to a cloud-land whither none may
LINE 763: climb.'
LINE 764: As the days and months went by the child grew more and more like
LINE 765: Genji. The new Empress was greatly distressed, but no one else seemed
LINE 766: to notice the resemblance. He was not of course so handsome; how
LINE 767: indeed should he have been? But both were beautiful, and the world was
LINE 768: content to accept their beauty without troubling to compare them, just
LINE 769: as it accepts both moon and sun as lovely occupants of the sky.
LINE 770: [1] They were not allowed to leave the palace.
LINE 771: [2] The bird that sings in Paradise.
LINE 772: [3] See above p. 19.
LINE 773: [4] In allusion to a boy-prince of seven years old whom the jealous
LINE 774: gods carried off to the sky. See the _Ōkagami_.
LINE 775: [5] Those who stand in a circle round the dancers while the latter
LINE 776: change their clothes.
LINE 777: [6] Reading 'Sadaijin,' not 'Sadaishō.'
LINE 778: [7] Another illegitimate son of the Emperor; Genji's step-brother.
LINE 779: [8] Fujitsubo's brother; Murasaki's father.
LINE 780: [9] Another name for the _nadeshiko_, 'Child-of-my-heart,' see p. 58.
LINE 781: [10] _Shū-i Shū_ 967.
LINE 782: [11] A sō no koto.
LINE 783: [12] That hate kills is a fundamental thesis of the book.
LINE 784: [13] 'So withered is the grass beneath its trees that the young colt
LINE 785: will not graze there and the reapers do not come.'
LINE 786: [14] 'So sweet is its shade that all the summer through its leafy
LINE 787: avenues are thronged,' alluding to the lady's many lovers.
LINE 788: [15] The headquarters of the Ladies of the Bedchamber.
LINE 789: [16] An old folk-song the refrain of which is 'At the melon-hoeing he
LINE 790: said he loved me and what am I to do, what am I to do?'
LINE 791: [17] The poem referred to is not the famous _Lute Girl's Song_, but a
LINE 792: much shorter one (_Works_ x. 8) on a similar theme. O-chou is the
LINE 793: modern Wu-ch'ang in Hupeh.
LINE 794: [18] In the song the lady says: 'The door is not bolted or barred.
LINE 795: Come quickly and talk to me. Am I another's bride, that you should be
LINE 796: so careful and shy?'
LINE 797: [18] The rank of Empress was often not conferred till quite late in a
LINE 798: reign. It was of course Fujitsubo whom the Emperor chose in this case.
LINE 799: [19] And therefore debarred from taking part in political life.
