LINE 1: The accession of the new Emperor was in many ways unfavourable to
LINE 2: Genji's position. His recent promotion[1] too brought with it heavy
LINE 3: responsibilities which sadly interrupted the course of his hidden
LINE 4: friendships, so that complaints of desertion or neglect were soon
LINE 5: heaped upon him from more than one quarter; while, as though Fate
LINE 6: wished to turn the tables upon him, the one being on earth for whose
LINE 7: love he longed in vain had now utterly abandoned him. Now that the
LINE 8: Emperor was free to live as he chose she was more constantly than ever
LINE 9: at his side, nor was her peace any longer disturbed by the presence of
LINE 10: a rival, for Kōkiden resenting the old Emperor's neglect now seldom
LINE 11: left her son's Palace. A constant succession of banquets and
LINE 12: entertainments, the magnificence of which became the talk of the whole
LINE 13: country, helped to enliven the ex-Emperor's retirement and he was on
LINE 14: the whole very well content with his new condition. His only regret
LINE 15: concerned the Heir Apparent[2] whose position, unsupported by any
LINE 16: powerful influence outside the Palace, he regarded as extremely
LINE 17: insecure. He constantly discussed the matter with Genji, begging him
LINE 18: to enlist the support of the Minamoto clan. Such conversations tended
LINE 19: to be somewhat embarrassing, but they gave Genji pleasure in so
LINE 20: far as they enabled him to take measures for the boy's welfare.
LINE 21: An unexpected event now occurred. Lady Rokujō's daughter by her late
LINE 22: husband Prince Zembō was chosen to be the new Vestal Virgin at Ise.[3]
LINE 23: Her mother, who at the time when the appointment was first announced
LINE 24: happened to be particularly aggrieved at Genji's treatment of her, at
LINE 25: once determined to make her daughter's extreme youth a pretext for
LINE 26: leaving the Capital and settling permanently at Ise. Being at the
LINE 27: moment, as I have said, very much out of humour, she discussed the
LINE 28: matter openly, making no secret of her real reasons for wishing to
LINE 29: leave the City. The story soon reached the ex-Emperor's ears, and
LINE 30: sending for Genji he said to him 'The late Prince my brother was, as
LINE 31: you probably know, regarded with the utmost affection and esteem and I
LINE 32: am profoundly grieved to hear that your reckless and inconsiderate
LINE 33: conduct has cast a slur upon his family. For his daughter indeed I
LINE 34: feel as much responsible as if she were of my own children. I must
LINE 35: trouble you in future to safeguard to the utmost of your power the
LINE 36: reputation of these unfortunate ladies. If you do not learn to keep
LINE 37: better control over your frivolous inclinations you will soon find
LINE 38: yourself becoming extremely unpopular.' Why should his father be so
LINE 39: much upset over the matter? And Genji, smarting under the rebuke, was
LINE 40: about to defend himself when it occurred to him that the warning was
LINE 41: not at all ill-merited and he maintained a respectful silence.
LINE 42: 'Affairs of this kind,' the ex-Emperor continued, 'must be managed so
LINE 43: that the woman, no matter who she is, need not feel that she has been
LINE 44: brought into a humiliating position or treated in a cynical and
LINE 45: off-hand way. Forget this rule, and she will soon make you feel the
LINE 46: unpleasant consequences of her resentment.' 'Wicked as he thinks
LINE 47: me already,' said Genji to himself while this lecture was going on,
LINE 48: 'there is a much worse enormity of which he as yet knows nothing.' And
LINE 49: stupefied with horror at the thought of what would ensue should his
LINE 50: father ever discover this hideous secret, he bowed and left the room.
LINE 51: What the ex-Emperor had said about ruining other people's reputations
LINE 52: cut him to the quick. He realized that Rokujō's rank and widowed
LINE 53: position entitled her to the utmost consideration. But after all it
LINE 54: was not he who had made public property of the affair; on the contrary
LINE 55: he had done everything in his power to prevent its becoming known.
LINE 56: There had always been a certain condescension in her treatment of him,
LINE 57: arising perhaps from the inequality of their ages,[4] and his
LINE 58: estrangement from her was solely due to the coldness with which she
LINE 59: had for a long time received him. That their private affairs were now
LINE 60: known not only to the ex-Emperor but also presumably to the whole
LINE 61: Court showed a lack of reticence which seemed to him deplorable.
LINE 62: Among others who heard of the business was Princess Asagao.[5]
LINE 63: Determined that she at least would not submit herself to such
LINE 64: treatment she ceased to answer his letters even with the short and
LINE 65: guarded replies that she had been in the habit of sending to him.
LINE 66: Nevertheless he found it hard to believe that so gentle-mannered a
LINE 67: creature was thinking unkindly of him and continued to regard her with
LINE 68: devoted admiration.
LINE 69: Princess Aoi when the story reached her ears was of course distressed
LINE 70: by this new instance of his fickleness; but she felt that it was
LINE 71: useless, now that his infidelity was open and unabashed, to protest
LINE 72: against one particular injury, and to his surprise she seemed to
LINE 73: take the matter rather lightly. She was suffering much inconvenience
LINE 74: from her condition and her spirits were very low. Her parents were
LINE 75: delighted and at the same time surprised to hear of what was to come.
LINE 76: But their pleasure and that of all her friends was marred by grave
LINE 77: forebodings, and it was arranged that prayers for her health and
LINE 78: special services of intercession should be recited in all the temples.
LINE 79: At such a time it was impossible for Genji to leave her and there were
LINE 80: many who though his feelings had not in reality cooled towards them
LINE 81: felt that they were being neglected.
LINE 82: The Vestal Virgin of Kamo still remained to be selected. The choice
LINE 83: fell upon Kōkiden's daughter, San no Miya. She was a great favourite
LINE 84: both with her brother the new Emperor and with the Empress Mother. Her
LINE 85: retirement from the world was a bitter blow to them; but there was no
LINE 86: help for it since she alone of all the royal princesses fulfilled the
LINE 87: prescribed conditions.
LINE 88: The actual ritual of investiture could not be altered, but the Emperor
LINE 89: saw to it that the proceedings should be attended with the utmost Pomp
LINE 90: and splendour; while to the customary ritual of the Kamo Festival he
LINE 91: added so many touches that it became a spectacle of unparalleled
LINE 92: magnificence. All this was due to his partiality for the Virgin Elect.
LINE 93: On the day of her purification the Virgin is attended by a fixed
LINE 94: number of noblemen and princes. For this retinue the Emperor was at
LINE 95: pains to choose the best built and handsomest of the young men at
LINE 96: Court; he settled what coloured gowns they were to wear, what pattern
LINE 97: was to be on their breeches, and even on what saddles they should
LINE 98: ride. By a special decree he ordered that Prince Genji should join
LINE 99: this retinue, and so great was everyone's desire to get a good view of
LINE 100: the procession that long beforehand people were getting ready
LINE 101: special carriages with which to line the route. The scene along the
LINE 102: highroad of the First Ward was one of indescribable excitement. Dense
LINE 103: crowds surged along the narrow space allotted to them, while the
LINE 104: stands which with a wealth of ingenious fancy had been constructed all
LINE 105: along the route of the procession, with gay cloaks and shawls hung
LINE 106: over the balustrades, were in themselves a spectacle of astonishing
LINE 107: beauty.
LINE 108: It had never been Aoi's practice to be present at such occasions as
LINE 109: this and in her present state of health she would not have dreamt of
LINE 110: doing so had not her gentlewomen pressed round her saying 'Come Madam!
LINE 111: It will be no fun for us to go by ourselves and be hidden away in some
LINE 112: corner. It is to see Prince Genji that all these people have come
LINE 113: to-day. Why, all sorts of queer wild men from the mountains are here,
LINE 114: and people have brought their wives and children from provinces ever
LINE 115: so far away. If all these people who are nothing to do with him have
LINE 116: taken the trouble to come so far, it will be too bad if you, his own
LINE 117: lady, are not there!' Overhearing this Aoi's mother joined in. 'You
LINE 118: are feeling much better just now,' she said; 'I think you ought to
LINE 119: make the effort. It will be so disappointing for your gentlewomen....'
LINE 120: At the last minute Aoi changed her mind and announced that she was
LINE 121: going. It was now so late that there was no time to put on gala
LINE 122: clothes. The whole of the enclosure allotted for this purpose was
LINE 123: already lined with coaches which were packed so close that it was
LINE 124: quite impossible to find space for the large and numerous carriages of
LINE 125: Aoi and her train. A number of grand ladies began to make room for
LINE 126: her, backing their coaches away from a suitable space in the reserved
LINE 127: enclosure. Conspicuous among the rest were two basket-work carriages
LINE 128: of a rather old-fashioned pattern but with curtains such as are used
LINE 129: by persons of quality, very discreetly decked with draperies that
LINE 130: barely showed beneath the curtains, yet these draperies (whether
LINE 131: sleeve-favour, skirt or scarf) all of the handsomest colours. They
LINE 132: seemed to belong to some exalted personage who did not wish to be
LINE 133: recognized. When it was their turn to move, the coachmen in charge of
LINE 134: them would not lift a finger. 'It is not for such as we to make way'
LINE 135: they said stiffly and did not stir. Among the attendants on both sides
LINE 136: there was a number of young grooms who were already the worse for
LINE 137: liquor. They were longing for a scuffle and it was impossible to keep
LINE 138: them in hand. The staid and elderly outriders tried to call them back,
LINE 139: but they took no notice.
LINE 140: The two carriages belonged to Princess Rokujō who had come secretly to
LINE 141: the festival hoping for a while to find distraction from her troubles.
LINE 142: Despite the steps which she had taken to conceal her identity, it was
LINE 143: at once suspected by some of Aoi's gentlemen and they cried to the
LINE 144: grooms that this was not an equipage which could be dealt with so
LINE 145: high-handedly or it would be said that their lady was abusing her
LINE 146: position as wife of the Lord Commander. But at this moment a number of
LINE 147: Genji's servants mingled in the fray. They knew Rokujō's men by sight,
LINE 148: but after a moment's embarrassment they decided not to give assistance
LINE 149: to the enemy by betraying his identity.
LINE 150: Thus reinforced Aoi's side won the day and at length her coach and
LINE 151: those of all her ladies were drawn up along the front row, while
LINE 152: Rokujō's was pushed back among a miscellaneous collection of carts and
LINE 153: gigs where she could see nothing at all. She was vexed beyond measure
LINE 154: not only at missing what she had come to see but also that despite all
LINE 155: her precautions she had been recognized and (as she was convinced)
LINE 156: deliberately insulted. Her shaft-rest and other parts of her coach as
LINE 157: well were damaged and she was obliged to prop it up against some
LINE 158: common person's carriage wheels. Why, she vainly asked herself, had
LINE 159: she come among these hateful crowds? She would go home at once. What
LINE 160: sense was there in waiting for the procession to come? But when she
LINE 161: tried to go, she found that it was impossible to force a way through
LINE 162: the dense crowds. She was still struggling to escape when the cry went
LINE 163: up that the procession was in sight. Her resolution weakened. She
LINE 164: would wait till Genji had passed by. He did not see her. How should
LINE 165: he, for the crowds flashed by him like the hurrying images that a
LINE 166: stream catches and breaks. She realized this, yet her disappointment
LINE 167: was none the less.
LINE 168: The carriages that lined the route, decked and garlanded for this
LINE 169: great day, were crammed to overflowing with excited ladies who though
LINE 170: there was no room for them would not consent to be left behind.
LINE 171: Peeping out under the blinds of their coaches they smiled at the great
LINE 172: personages who were passing quite regardless of whether their
LINE 173: greetings were acknowledged. But every now and then a smile would be
LINE 174: rewarded by a quick glance or the backward turn of a head. Aoi's party
LINE 175: was large and conspicuous. He wheeled round as he passed and saluted
LINE 176: its members attentively. Rider after rider again as the procession
LINE 177: went by would pause in front of Aoi's coach and salute her with the
LINE 178: deepest respect. The humiliation of witnessing all this from an
LINE 179: obscure corner was more than Rokujō could bear, and murmuring the
LINE 180: lines 'Though I saw him but as a shadow that falls on hurrying waters
LINE 181: yet knew I that at last my hour of utmost misery was come' she burst
LINE 182: into tears. It was hideous that her servants should see her in this
LINE 183: state. Yet even while she struggled with her tears she could not find
LINE 184: it in her heart to regret that she had seen him in all his glory.
LINE 185: The riders in the procession were indeed all magnificently
LINE 186: apparelled, each according to his own rank; in particular the young
LINE 187: noblemen chosen by the Emperor cut so brilliant a figure that only the
LINE 188: lustre of Genji's beauty could have eclipsed their splendour. The
LINE 189: Commander of this Bodyguard is not generally allotted a Palace-Officer
LINE 190: as his special attendant, but as the occasion was of such importance
LINE 191: the Imperial Treasurer[6] rode at Genji's side. It seemed to those who
LINE 192: saw so many public honours showered upon him that no flower of fortune
LINE 193: could resist the favouring gale which blew towards his side. There
LINE 194: were among the crowd women of quite good birth who had dressed in
LINE 195: walking-skirts and come a long way on foot. There were nuns and other
LINE 196: female recluses who, though in order to see anything of the procession
LINE 197: they were obliged to endure being constantly pushed off their feet,
LINE 198: and though they commonly regarded all such spectacles with contempt
LINE 199: and aversion, were to-day declaring that they would not have missed it
LINE 200: for anything. There were old men grinning through toothless gums,
LINE 201: strange-looking girls with their hair poked away under ragged hoods
LINE 202: and stolid peasant boys standing with hands raised as though in
LINE 203: prayer, whose uncouth faces were suddenly transfigured with wonder and
LINE 204: joy as the procession burst into sight. Even the daughters of remote
LINE 205: provincial magistrates and governors who had no acquaintances whatever
LINE 206: in the City had expended as much coquetry upon the decoration of their
LINE 207: persons and coaches as if they were about to submit themselves to a
LINE 208: lover's inspection, and their equipages made a bright and varied show.
LINE 209: If even these strangers were in such a taking, it may be imagined with
LINE 210: what excitement, scattered here and there among the crowd, those with
LINE 211: whom Genji was in secret communication watched the procession go by
LINE 212: and with how many hidden sighs their bosoms heaved.
LINE 213: Prince Momozono[7] had a seat in one of the stands. He was amazed to
LINE 214: see his nephew grown up into such a prodigiously handsome young man
LINE 215: and was alarmed lest soon the gods should cast an envious eye upon
LINE 216: him. Princess Asagao could not but be touched by the rare persistency
LINE 217: with which year after year Genji had pressed his suit. Even had he
LINE 218: been positively ugly she would have found it hard to resist such
LINE 219: importunity; so small wonder if seeing him ride by in all his
LINE 220: splendour she marvelled that she had held out so long. But she was
LINE 221: determined to know him much better before she committed herself. The
LINE 222: young waiting-women who were with her were careful to belaud him in
LINE 223: extravagant terms. To the festival itself[8] Aoi did not go. The
LINE 224: affray between her servants and those of Rokujō was soon reported to
LINE 225: Genji. It vexed him beyond measure that such a thing should have
LINE 226: occurred. That the exquisitely well-bred Aoi should have been in any
LINE 227: way responsible for this outburst of insolent ruffianism he did not
LINE 228: for a moment believe; it must be the work of rough under-servants who,
LINE 229: though they had no actual instructions, had imbibed the notion that
LINE 230: all was not well between the two houses and imagined that they would
LINE 231: get credit for espousing their mistress's cause. He knew well enough
LINE 232: the unusual vanity and susceptibility of the affronted lady.
LINE 233: Distressed to think of the pain which this incident must have caused
LINE 234: her he hastened to her house. But her daughter, the Virgin Elect of
LINE 235: Ise, was still in the house, and she made this a plea for turning him
LINE 236: away after the exchange of a few formal words. He had the greatest
LINE 237: possible sympathy for her; but he was feeling rather tired of coping
LINE 238: with injured susceptibilities.
LINE 239: He could not face the idea of going straight back to the Great Hall.
LINE 240: It was the day of the Kamo festival and going to his own palace he
LINE 241: ordered Koremitsu to get his coach ready. 'Look at her!' he cried
LINE 242: smiling fondly at Murasaki when she appeared in all her finery
LINE 243: surrounded by the little children whom he had given her for playmates,
LINE 244: 'She must needs bring her dames to wait upon her!' and stroking her
LINE 245: lovely hair which to-day Shōnagon had dressed with more than usual
LINE 246: care. 'It is getting rather long' he said; 'to-day would not be a
LINE 247: bad[9] time to have it cut' and sending for his astrologer he bade him
LINE 248: consult his books. 'The maids-of-honour first!' he cried, nodding at
LINE 249: the pretty troupe of babes, and their dainty tresses were trimmed so
LINE 250: as to hang neatly over their diapered holiday gowns. 'I am going to
LINE 251: cut yours myself' he said to Murasaki. 'What a lot of it there is! I
LINE 252: wonder how much longer it would have grown.' Really it was quite hard
LINE 253: work. 'People with very long hair ought to wear it cut rather short
LINE 254: over the temples' he said at last; 'but I have not the heart to crop
LINE 255: you any closer' and he laid the knife down. Shōnagon's gratification
LINE 256: knew no bounds when she heard him reciting the prayer with which the
LINE 257: ceremony of hair-cutting should conclude. There is a sea-weed called
LINE 258: _miru_ which is used in the dressing of ladies' hair and playing upon
LINE 259: this word (which also means 'to see') he recited a poem in which he
LINE 260: said that the miru-weed which had been used in the washing of her hair
LINE 261: was a token that he would forever fondly watch it grow. She answered
LINE 262: that like the sea-tides which visit the _miru_ in its cleft he came
LINE 263: but went away, and often her tresses unwatched by him would like the
LINE 264: hidden sea-weed grow. This she wrote very prettily on a slip of paper
LINE 265: and though the verse had no merit in it but the charm of a childish
LINE 266: mind it gave him great delight. To-day the crowds were as thick
LINE 267: as ever. With great difficulty he managed to wedge in his carriage
LINE 268: close to the Royal Stables. But here they were surrounded by somewhat
LINE 269: turbulent young noblemen and he was looking for a quieter place when a
LINE 270: smart carriage crammed full of ladies drew up near by and some one in
LINE 271: it beckoned with a fan to Genji's servants. 'Will you not come over
LINE 272: where we are?' said one of the ladies. 'We will gladly make room for
LINE 273: you.' Such an offer was perhaps somewhat forward, but the place she
LINE 274: had indicated was such a good one that Genji at once accepted the
LINE 275: invitation. 'I am afraid it is very unfair that we should take your
LINE 276: place like this ...' Genji was beginning to say politely, when one of
LINE 277: the ladies handed him a fan with the corner bent down. Here he found
LINE 278: the poem: 'This flower-decked day of meeting when the great god
LINE 279: unfolds his portents in vain have I waited, for alas another is at thy
LINE 280: side.' Surely the handwriting was familiar. Yes, it was that of the
LINE 281: ancient lady-of-the-bedchamber. He felt that it was time she should
LINE 282: give up such pranks as this and answered discouragingly: 'Not ours
LINE 283: this day of tryst when garlanded and passionate the Eighty Tribes
LINE 284: converge.' This put the lady out of countenance and she replied: 'Now
LINE 285: bitterly do I repent that for this cheating day my head is decked with
LINE 286: flowers; for in name only is it a day of meeting.'
LINE 287: Their carriages remained side by side, but Genji did not even draw up
LINE 288: the side-curtains, which was a disappointment to more persons than
LINE 289: one. The magnificence of his public appearance a few days ago was
LINE 290: contrasted by everyone with the unobtrusive manner in which he now
LINE 291: mingled with the crowd. It was agreed that his companion, whoever she
LINE 292: might be, must certainly be some very great lady. Genji was afraid
LINE 293: that his neighbour was going to prove troublesome. But fortunately
LINE 294: some of her companions had more discretion than their mistress,
LINE 295: and out of consideration for the unknown sharer of Genji's coach
LINE 296: persuaded the voluble lady to restrain herself.
LINE 297: Lady Rokujō's sufferings were now far worse than in previous years.
LINE 298: Though she could no longer endure to be treated as Genji was treating
LINE 299: her, yet the thought of separating from him altogether and going so
LINE 300: far away agitated her so much that she constantly deferred her
LINE 301: journey. She felt too that she would become a laughingstock if it was
LINE 302: thought that she had been spurred to flight by Genji's scorn; yet if
LINE 303: at the last moment she changed her plans and stayed behind everyone
LINE 304: would think her conduct extremely ill-balanced and unaccountable. Thus
LINE 305: her days and nights were spent in an agony of indecision and often she
LINE 306: repeated to herself the lines 'My heart like the fishers' float on Ise
LINE 307: shore is danced from wave to wave.'[10] She felt herself indeed
LINE 308: swirled this way and that by paroxysms that sickened her but were
LINE 309: utterly beyond her control.
LINE 310: Genji, though it pained him that she should feel it necessary to go so
LINE 311: far away did not attempt to dissuade her from the journey. 'It is
LINE 312: quite natural' he wrote, 'that tiresome creature as I am you should
LINE 313: want to put me altogether out of your head. I only beg that even
LINE 314: though you see no use in it, you will let me see you once more before
LINE 315: you go. Were we to meet, you would soon realize that I care for your
LINE 316: happiness far more than you suppose.' But she could not forget how
LINE 317: when at the River of cleansing she sought a respite from the torture
LINE 318: of her own doubt and indecision, rough waves had dashed her against
LINE 319: the rocks,[11] and she brooded more and more upon this wrong till
LINE 320: there was room for no other thought in all her heart.
LINE 321: Meanwhile Princess Aoi became strangely distraught, and it seemed at
LINE 322: times as though some hostile spirit had entered into her. The whole
LINE 323: household was plunged into such a state of anxiety and gloom that
LINE 324: Genji had not the heart to absent himself for more than a few hours.
LINE 325: It was only very occasionally that he got even as far as his own
LINE 326: palace. After all, she was his wife; moreover, despite all the
LINE 327: difficulties that had risen between them he cared for her very much
LINE 328: indeed. He could no longer disguise from himself that there was
LINE 329: something wrong with her in addition to the discomfort which naturally
LINE 330: accompanied her condition, and he was in a state of great distress.
LINE 331: Constant rituals of exorcism and divination were performed under his
LINE 332: direction, and it was generally agreed that all the signs indicated
LINE 333: possession by the spirit of some living person. Many names were tried
LINE 334: but to none of them did the spirit respond, and it seemed as though it
LINE 335: would be impossible to shift it. Aoi herself felt that some alien
LINE 336: thing had entered into her, and though she was not conscious of any
LINE 337: one definite pain or dread the sense that the thing was there never
LINE 338: for a moment left her. The greatest healers of the day were powerless
LINE 339: to eject it and it became apparent that this was no ordinary case of
LINE 340: 'possession': some tremendous accumulation of malice was discharging
LINE 341: itself upon her. It was natural that her friends should turn over in
LINE 342: their minds the names of those whom Genji had most favoured. It was
LINE 343: whispered that only with Lady Rokujō and the girl at the Nijō-in was
LINE 344: he on terms of such intimacy that their jealousy would be at all
LINE 345: likely to produce a fatal effect. But when the doctors attempted to
LINE 346: conjure the spirit by the use of these names, there was no visible
LINE 347: response. She had not in all the world any enemy who might be
LINE 348: practising conscious[12] witchcraft against her. Such indispositions
LINE 349: were sometimes attributed to possession by the spirit of some
LINE 350: dead retainer or old family-nurse; or again the malice of someone whom
LINE 351: the Minister, Aoi's father, had offended might, owing to her delicate
LINE 352: condition, have fastened upon her instead of him. Conjecture after
LINE 353: conjecture was accepted and then falsified. Meanwhile she lay
LINE 354: perpetually weeping. Constantly, indeed, she would break out into fits
LINE 355: of sobbing so violent that her breath was stopped, while those about
LINE 356: her, in great alarm for her safety, stood by in misery not knowing
LINE 357: what to do.
LINE 358: The ex-Emperor enquired after her continually. He even ordered special
LINE 359: services to be said on her behalf, and these attentions served to
LINE 360: remind her parents in what high estimation she was held at the Court.
LINE 361: Not among her friends only but throughout the whole country the news
LINE 362: of her illness caused great distress. Rokujō heard of her sufferings
LINE 363: with deep concern. For years they had been in open rivalry for Genji's
LINE 364: favours, but even after that wretched affair of the coaches (though it
LINE 365: must be admitted that this had greatly incensed her) she had never
LINE 366: gone so far as to wish evil against the Princess. She herself was very
LINE 367: unwell. She began to feel that the violent and distracting emotions
LINE 368: which continually assailed her had in some subtle way unhinged her
LINE 369: mind and she determined to seek spiritual assistance at a place some
LINE 370: miles distant from her home. Genji heard of this and in great anxiety
LINE 371: concerning her at once set out for the house where she was reported to
LINE 372: be staying. It lay beyond the City precincts and he was obliged to go
LINE 373: with the greatest secrecy.[13] He begged her to forgive him for not
LINE 374: having come to see her for so long. 'I have not been having a very
LINE 375: cheerful time' he said and gave her some account of Aoi's condition.
LINE 376: He wanted to make her feel that if he had stayed away it had been
LINE 377: from a melancholy necessity and not because he had found more amusing
LINE 378: company elsewhere. 'It is not so much my own anxiety that unnerves me
LINE 379: as the spectacle of the appalling helplessness and misery into which
LINE 380: her illness has plunged her wretched parents, and it was in the hope
LINE 381: of forgetting for a little while all these sickroom horrors that I
LINE 382: came to see you here to-day. If only just for this once you could
LINE 383: overlook all my offences and be kind to me....'
LINE 384: His pleading had no effect. Her attitude was more hostile than before.
LINE 385: He was not angry with her, nor indeed was he surprised. Day was
LINE 386: already breaking when, unsolaced, he set out for home. But as she
LINE 387: watched him go his beauty suddenly made havoc of all her resolutions
LINE 388: and again she felt that it was madness to leave him. Yet what had she
LINE 389: to stay for? Aoi was with child and this could only be a sign that he
LINE 390: had made his peace with her. Henceforward he could lead a life of
LINE 391: irreproachable rectitude and if once in a way he came to make his
LINE 392: excuse as he had come to-day, what purpose would that serve, save to
LINE 393: keep ever fresh the torment of her desires? Thus when his letter came
LINE 394: next day it found her more distraught than before: 'The sick woman who
LINE 395: for a few days past had shown some improvement is again suffering
LINE 396: acutely and it is at present impossible for me to leave her.' Certain
LINE 397: that this was a mere excuse she sent in reply the poem 'The fault is
LINE 398: mine and the regret, if careless as the peasant girl who stoops too
LINE 399: low amid the sprouting rice I soiled my sleeve in love's dark road.'
LINE 400: At the end of her letter she reminded him of the old song: 'Now
LINE 401: bitterly do I repent that ever I brought my pitcher to the mountain
LINE 402: well where waters were but deep enough to soil my sleeve.' He looked
LINE 403: at the delicate handwriting. Who was there, even among women of her
LINE 404: high lineage and breeding, that could rival the ineffable grace
LINE 405: and elegance with which this small note was penned? That one whose
LINE 406: mind and person alike so strongly attracted him must now by his own
LINE 407: act be lost to him forever, was a bitter thought. Though it was almost
LINE 408: dark, he sat down and wrote to her: 'Do not say that the waters have
LINE 409: but wetted your sleeve. For the shallowness is in your comparison
LINE 410: only; not in my affections!' And to this he added the poem: ''Tis you,
LINE 411: you only who have loitered among the shallow pools: while I till all
LINE 412: my limbs were drenched have battled through the thickets of love's
LINE 413: dark track.' And he ended with the words: 'Had but a ray of comfort
LINE 414: lighted the troubles of this house, I should myself have been the
LINE 415: bearer of this note.'
LINE 416: Meanwhile Aoi's possession had returned in full force; she was in a
LINE 417: state of pitiable torment. It reached Lady Rokujō's ears that the
LINE 418: illness had been attributed by some to the operation of her 'living
LINE 419: spirit.' Others, she was told, believed that her father's ghost was
LINE 420: avenging the betrayal of his daughter. She brooded constantly upon the
LINE 421: nature of her own feelings towards Aoi, but could discover in herself
LINE 422: nothing but intense unhappiness. Of hostility towards Aoi she could
LINE 423: find no trace at all. Yet she could not be sure whether somewhere in
LINE 424: the depths of a soul consumed by anguish some spark of malice had not
LINE 425: lurked. Through all the long years during which she had loved and
LINE 426: suffered, though it had often seemed to her that greater torment could
LINE 427: not anywhere in the world exist, her whole being had never once been
LINE 428: so utterly bruised and shattered as in these last days. It had begun
LINE 429: with that hateful episode of the coaches. She had been scorned,
LINE 430: treated as though she had no right to exist. Yes, it was true that
LINE 431: since the Festival of Purification her mind had been buffeted by such
LINE 432: a tempest of conflicting resolutions that sometimes it seemed as
LINE 433: though she had lost all control over her own thoughts. She
LINE 434: remembered how one night she had suddenly, in the midst of agonizing
LINE 435: doubts and indecisions, found that she had been dreaming. It seemed to
LINE 436: her that she had been in a large magnificent room, where lay a girl
LINE 437: whom she knew to be the Princess Aoi. Snatching her by the arm she had
LINE 438: dragged and mauled the prostrate figure, with an outburst of brutal
LINE 439: fury such as in her waking life would have been utterly foreign to
LINE 440: her. Since then she had had the same dream several times. How
LINE 441: terrible! It seemed then that it was really possible for one's spirit
LINE 442: to leave the body and break out into emotions which the waking mind
LINE 443: would not countenance. Even where someone's actions are all but
LINE 444: irreproachable (she reflected) people take a malicious delight in
LINE 445: saying nothing about the good he has done and everything about the
LINE 446: evil. With what joy would they seize upon such a story as this! That
LINE 447: after his death a man's ghost should pursue his enemies is a thing
LINE 448: which seems to be of constant occurrence, yet even this is taken as a
LINE 449: sign that the dead man was of a fiendishly venomous and malignant
LINE 450: character and his reputation is utterly destroyed. 'What then will
LINE 451: become of me if it is thought that while still alive I have been
LINE 452: guilty of so hideous a crime?' She must face her fate. She had lost
LINE 453: Genji for ever. If she were to keep any control at all over her own
LINE 454: thoughts she must first of all find some way of putting him wholly out
LINE 455: of mind. She kept on reminding herself not to think of him, so that
LINE 456: this very resolve led her in the end to think of him but the more.
LINE 457: The Virgin of Ise should by rights have entered upon her duties before
LINE 458: the end of the year, but difficulties of various kinds arose and it
LINE 459: was not till the autumn of the next year that she could at last be
LINE 460: received. She was to enter the Palace in-the-Fields[14] in the ninth
LINE 461: month, but this was decided so late that the arrangements for
LINE 462: her second Purification had to be made in great haste. It was
LINE 463: very inconvenient that at this crisis her mother, so far from
LINE 464: superintending the preparations, spent hour after hour lying dazed and
LINE 465: helpless upon her bed. At last the priests arrived to fetch the girl
LINE 466: away. They took a grave view of the mother's condition and gave her
LINE 467: the benefit of their presence by offering up many prayers and
LINE 468: incantations. But week after week she remained in the same condition,
LINE 469: showing no symptom which seemed actually dangerous, yet all the time
LINE 470: (in some vague and indefinite way) obviously very ill. Genji sent
LINE 471: constantly to enquire after her, but she saw clearly that his
LINE 472: attention was occupied by quite other matters. Aoi's delivery was not
LINE 473: yet due and no preparations for it had been made, when suddenly there
LINE 474: were signs that it was close at hand. She was in great distress, but
LINE 475: though the healers recited prayer upon prayer their utmost efforts
LINE 476: could not shift by one jot the spiteful power which possessed her. All
LINE 477: the greatest miracle-workers of the land were there; the utter failure
LINE 478: of their ministrations irritated and perplexed them. At last, daunted
LINE 479: by the potency of their incantations, the spirit that possessed her
LINE 480: found voice and, weeping bitterly, she was heard to say: 'Give me a
LINE 481: little respite; there is a matter of which Prince Genji and I must
LINE 482: speak.' The healers nodded at one another as though to say 'Now we
LINE 483: shall learn something worth knowing,' for they were convinced that the
LINE 484: 'possession' was speaking through the mouth of the possessed, and they
LINE 485: hurried Genji to her bedside. Her parents thinking that, her end being
LINE 486: near, she desired to give some last secret injunction to Genji,
LINE 487: retired to the back of the room. The priests too ceased their
LINE 488: incantations and began to recite the _Hokkekyo_[15] in low impressive
LINE 489: tones. He raised the bed-curtain. She looked lovely as ever as
LINE 490: she lay there, very big with child, and any man who saw her even
LINE 491: now would have found himself strangely troubled by her beauty. How
LINE 492: much the more then Prince Genji, whose heart was already overflowing
LINE 493: with tenderness and remorse! The plaited tresses of her long hair
LINE 494: stood out in sharp contrast to her white jacket.[16] Even to this
LINE 495: loose, sick-room garb her natural grace imparted the air of a
LINE 496: fashionable gown! He took her hand. 'It is terrible' he began, 'to see
LINE 497: you looking so unhappy ...' he could say no more. Still she gazed at
LINE 498: him, but through his tears he saw that there was no longer in her eyes
LINE 499: the wounded scorn that he had come to know so well, but a look of
LINE 500: forbearance and tender concern; and while she watched him weep her own
LINE 501: eyes brimmed with tears. It would not do for him to go on crying like
LINE 502: this. Her father and mother would be alarmed; besides, it was
LINE 503: upsetting Aoi herself, and meaning to cheer her he said: 'Come, things
LINE 504: are not so bad as that! You will soon be much better. But even if
LINE 505: anything should happen, it is certain that we shall meet again in
LINE 506: worlds to come. Your father and mother too, and many others, love you
LINE 507: so dearly that between your fate and theirs must be some sure bond
LINE 508: that will bring you back to them in many, many lives that are to be.'
LINE 509: Suddenly she interrupted him: 'No, no. That is not it. But stop these
LINE 510: prayers awhile. They do me great harm,' and drawing him nearer to her
LINE 511: she went on 'I did not think that you would come. I have waited for
LINE 512: you till all my soul is burnt with longing.' She spoke wistfully,
LINE 513: tenderly; and still in the same tone recited the verse 'Bind thou, as
LINE 514: the seam of a skirt is braided, this shred, that from my soul despair
LINE 515: and loneliness have sundered.' The voice in which these words were
LINE 516: said was not Aoi's; nor was the manner hers. He knew someone
LINE 517: whose voice was very like that. Who was it? Why, yes; surely only
LINE 518: she,—the Lady Rokujō. Once or twice he had heard people suggest that
LINE 519: something of this kind might be happening; but he had always rejected
LINE 520: the idea as hideous and unthinkable, believing it to be the malicious
LINE 521: invention of some unprincipled scandalmonger, and had even denied that
LINE 522: such 'possession' ever took place. Now he had seen one with his own
LINE 523: eyes. Ghastly, unbelievable as they were, such things did happen in
LINE 524: real life. Controlling himself at last he said in a low voice: 'I am
LINE 525: not sure who is speaking to me. Do not leave me in doubt....' Her
LINE 526: answer proved only too conclusively that he had guessed aright. To his
LINE 527: horror her parents now came back to the bed, but she had ceased to
LINE 528: speak, and seeing her now lying quietly her mother thought the attack
LINE 529: was over, and was coming towards the bed carrying a basin of hot water
LINE 530: when Aoi suddenly started up and bore a child. For the moment all was
LINE 531: gladness and rejoicing; but it seemed only too likely that the spirit
LINE 532: which possessed her had but been temporarily dislodged; for a fierce
LINE 533: fit of terror was soon upon her, as though the thing (whatever it was)
LINE 534: were angry at having been put to the trouble of shifting, so that
LINE 535: there was still grave anxiety about the future. The Abbot of Tendai
LINE 536: and the other great ecclesiastics who were gathered together in the
LINE 537: room attributed her easy delivery to the persistency of their own
LINE 538: incantations and prayers, and as they hastily withdrew to seek
LINE 539: refreshment and repose they wiped the sweat from their brows with an
LINE 540: expression of considerable self-satisfaction. Her friends who had for
LINE 541: days been plunged in the deepest gloom now began to take heart a
LINE 542: little, believing that although there was no apparent improvement yet
LINE 543: now that the child was safely born she could not fail to mend. The
LINE 544: prayers and incantations began once more, but throughout the
LINE 545: house there was a new feeling of confidence; for the amusement of
LINE 546: looking after the baby at least gave them some relief from the strain
LINE 547: under which they had been living for so many days. Handsome presents
LINE 548: were sent by the ex-Emperor, the Royal Princes and all the Court,
LINE 549: forming an array which grew more dazzling each night.[17] The fact
LINE 550: that the child was a boy made the celebrations connected with his
LINE 551: birth all the more sumptuous and elaborate.
LINE 552: The news of this event took Lady Rokujō somewhat aback. The last
LINE 553: report she had heard from the Great Hall was that the confinement was
LINE 554: bound to be very dangerous. And now they said that there had not been
LINE 555: the slightest difficulty. She thought this very peculiar. She had
LINE 556: herself for a long while been suffering from the most disconcerting
LINE 557: sensations. Often she felt as though her whole personality had in some
LINE 558: way suddenly altered. It was as though she were a stranger to herself.
LINE 559: Recently she had noticed that a smell of mustard-seed incense for
LINE 560: which she was at a loss to account was pervading her clothes and hair.
LINE 561: She took a hot bath and put on other clothes; but still the same odour
LINE 562: of incense pursued her. It was bad enough even in private to have this
LINE 563: sensation of being as it were estranged from oneself. But now her body
LINE 564: was playing tricks upon her which her attendants must have noticed and
LINE 565: were no doubt discussing behind her back. Yet there was not one person
LINE 566: among those about her with whom she could bring herself to discuss
LINE 567: such things and all this pent-up misery seemed only to increase the
LINE 568: strange process of dissolution which had begun to attack her mind.
LINE 569: Now that Genji was somewhat less anxious about Aoi's condition the
LINE 570: recollection of his extraordinary conversation with her at the
LINE 571: crisis of her attack kept on recurring in his mind, and it made so
LINE 572: painful an impression upon him that though it was now a long time
LINE 573: since he had communicated with Rokujō and he knew that she must be
LINE 574: deeply offended, he felt that no kind of intimacy with her would ever
LINE 575: again be possible. Yet in the end pity prevailed and he sent her a
LINE 576: letter. It seemed indeed that it would at present be heartless to
LINE 577: absent himself at all from one who had just passed through days of
LINE 578: such terrible suffering and from her friends who were still in a state
LINE 579: of the gravest anxiety, and all his secret excursions were abandoned.
LINE 580: Aoi still remained in a condition so serious that he was not allowed
LINE 581: to see her. The child was as handsome an infant as you could wish to
LINE 582: see. The great interest which Genji took in it and the zest with which
LINE 583: he entered into all the arrangements which were made for its welfare
LINE 584: delighted Aoi's father, inasmuch as they seemed signs of a better
LINE 585: understanding between his daughter and Genji; and though her slow
LINE 586: recovery caused him great anxiety, he realized that an illness such as
LINE 587: that through which she had just passed must inevitably leave
LINE 588: considerable traces behind it and he persuaded himself that her
LINE 589: condition was less dangerous than one might have supposed. The child
LINE 590: reminded Genji of the Heir Apparent and made him long to see
LINE 591: Fujitsubo's little son again. The desire took such strong hold upon
LINE 592: him that at last he sent Aoi a message in which he said: 'It is a very
LINE 593: long time since I have been to the Palace or indeed have paid any
LINE 594: visits at all. I am beginning to feel the need of a little
LINE 595: distraction, so to-day I am going out for a short while and should
LINE 596: like to see you before I go. I do not want to feel that we are
LINE 597: completely cut off from one another.' So he pleaded, and he was
LINE 598: supported by her ladies who told her that Prince Genji was her own
LINE 599: dear Lord and that she ought not to be so proud and stiff with him.
LINE 600: She feared that her illness had told upon her looks and was for
LINE 601: speaking to him with a curtain between, but this too her gentlewomen
LINE 602: would not allow. He brought a stool close to where she was lying and
LINE 603: began speaking to her of one thing or another. Occasionally she put in
LINE 604: a word or two, but it was evident that she was still very weak.
LINE 605: Nevertheless it was difficult to believe that she had so recently
LINE 606: seemed almost at the point of death. They were talking quietly
LINE 607: together about those worst days of her illness and how they now seemed
LINE 608: like an evil dream when suddenly he recollected the extraordinary
LINE 609: conversation he had had with her when she was lying apparently at her
LINE 610: last gasp and filled with a sudden bitterness, he said to her: 'There
LINE 611: are many other things that I must one day talk to you about. But you
LINE 612: seem very tired and perhaps I had better leave you.' So saying he
LINE 613: arranged her pillows, brought her warm water to wash in and in fact
LINE 614: played the sick-nurse so well that those about her wondered where he
LINE 615: had acquired the art. Still peerlessly beautiful but weak and listless
LINE 616: she seemed as she lay motionless on the bed at times almost to fade
LINE 617: out of existence. He gazed at her with fond concern. Her hair, every
LINE 618: ringlet still in its right place, was spread out over the pillow.
LINE 619: Never before had her marvellous beauty so strangely impressed him. Was
LINE 620: it conceivable that year after year he should have allowed such a
LINE 621: woman to continue in estrangement from him? Still he stood gazing at
LINE 622: her. 'I must start for the Palace,' he said at last; 'but I shall not
LINE 623: be away long. Now that you are better you must try to make your mother
LINE 624: feel less anxious about you when she comes presently; for though she
LINE 625: tries hard not to show it, she is still terribly distressed about you.
LINE 626: You must begin now to make an effort and sit up for a little while
LINE 627: each day. I think it is partly because she spoils you so much that you
LINE 628: are taking so long to get well.' As he left the room, robed in
LINE 629: all the magnificence of his court attire she followed him with her
LINE 630: eyes more fixedly than ever in her life before. The attendance of the
LINE 631: officers who took part in the autumn session was required, and Aoi's
LINE 632: father accompanied Genji to the Palace, as did also her brother who
LINE 633: needed the Minister's assistance in making their arrangements for the
LINE 634: coming political year. Many of their servants went too and the Great
LINE 635: Hall wore a deserted and melancholy aspect. Suddenly Aoi was seized
LINE 636: with the same choking-fit as before and was soon in a desperate
LINE 637: condition. This news was brought to Genji in the Palace and breaking
LINE 638: off his Audience he at once made for home. The rest followed in hot
LINE 639: haste and though it was Appointment Evening[18] they gave up all
LINE 640: thought of attending the proceedings, knowing that the tragic turn of
LINE 641: affairs at the Great Hall would be considered a sufficient excuse. It
LINE 642: was too late to get hold of the abbot from Mount Tendai or any of the
LINE 643: dignitaries who had given their assistance before. It was appalling
LINE 644: that just when she seemed to have taken a turn for the better she
LINE 645: should so suddenly again be at the point of death, and the people at
LINE 646: the Great Hall felt utterly helpless and bewildered. Soon the house
LINE 647: was full of lackeys who were arriving from every side with messages of
LINE 648: sympathy and enquiry; but from the inhabitants of that stricken house
LINE 649: they could obtain no information, for they seemed to do nothing but
LINE 650: rush about from one room to another in a state of frenzy which it was
LINE 651: terrifying to behold.
LINE 652: Remembering that several times already her 'possession' had reduced
LINE 653: her to a trance-like state, they did not for some time attempt to lay
LINE 654: out the body or even touch her pillows, but left her lying just as she
LINE 655: was. After two or three days however it became clear that life was
LINE 656: extinct.
LINE 657: Amid the general lamentations which ensued Genji's spirit sank
LINE 658: with the apathy of utter despair. Sorrow had followed too fast upon
LINE 659: sorrow; life as he saw it now was but a succession of futile miseries.
LINE 660: The messages of condolence which poured in from all the most exalted
LINE 661: quarters in the Court and City merely fatigued and exasperated him.
LINE 662: The warmth of the old ex-Emperor's messages and his evident personal
LINE 663: distress at Aoi's death were indeed very flattering and mingled a
LINE 664: certain feeling of gratification with her father's perpetual weeping.
LINE 665: At the suggestion of a friend various drastic means were resorted to
LINE 666: in the hope that it might yet be possible to kindle some spark of life
LINE 667: in the body. But it soon became evident, even to their reluctant eyes,
LINE 668: that all this was too late, and heavy at heart they took the body to
LINE 669: Toribeno. Here, in the great flat cremation-ground beyond the town,
LINE 670: the horrors that they had dreaded were only too swiftly begun. Even in
LINE 671: this huge open space there was scarcely room for the crowds of
LINE 672: mourners who had come from all the great palaces of the City to follow
LINE 673: behind the bier and for the concourses of priests who, chanting their
LINE 674: liturgies, flocked from the neighbouring temples. The ex-Emperor was
LINE 675: of course represented; so were the Princess Kōkiden and the Heir
LINE 676: Apparent; while many other important people came in person and mingled
LINE 677: with the crowd. Never had any funeral aroused so universal a
LINE 678: demonstration of interest and sympathy. Her father was not present:
LINE 679: 'Now in my declining years to have lost one who was so young and
LINE 680: strong is a blow too staggering ...' he said and he could no longer
LINE 681: check the tears which he was striving to conceal. His grief was
LINE 682: heart-rending. All night long the mournful ceremonies proceeded, but
LINE 683: at last only a few pitiful ashes remained upon the pyre and in the
LINE 684: morning the mourners returned to their homes. It was in fact, save for
LINE 685: its grandeurs, much like any other funeral; but it so happened that
LINE 686: save in one case only death had not yet come Genji's way and the
LINE 687: scenes of that day haunted him long afterwards with hideous persistency.
LINE 688: The ceremony took place in the last week of the eighth month. Seeing
LINE 689: that from Aoi's father all the soft brightness of this autumn morning
LINE 690: was hid in the twilight of despair and well knowing what thoughts must
LINE 691: be passing through his mind, Genji came to him and pointing to the sky
LINE 692: whispered the following verse: 'Because of all the mists that wreathe
LINE 693: the autumn sky I know not which ascended from my lady's bier,
LINE 694: henceforth upon the country of the clouds from pole to pole I gaze
LINE 695: with love.'
LINE 696: At last he was back in his room. He lay down, but could not sleep. His
LINE 697: thoughts went back over the years that he had known her. Why had he
LINE 698: been content lazily to assume that in the end all would go right and
LINE 699: meanwhile amused himself regardless of her resentment? Why had he let
LINE 700: year after year go by without managing even at the very end to
LINE 701: establish any real intimacy, any sympathy between them? The bitterest
LINE 702: remorse now filled his heart; but what use was it? His servants
LINE 703: brought him his light grey mourner's dress and the strange thought
LINE 704: floated into his mind 'What if I had died instead and not she? She
LINE 705: would be getting into the woman-mourner's deep-dyed robe,' and he
LINE 706: recited the poem: 'Though light in hue the dress which in bereavement
LINE 707: custom bids me wear, yet black my sorrow as the gown thou wouldst have
LINE 708: worn;' and as thus clad he told his rosary those about him noted that
LINE 709: even the dull hues of mourning could not make him look peaked or drab.
LINE 710: He read many sūtras in a low voice, among them the liturgy to
LINE 711: Samantabhadra as Dispenser of the Dharmadhātu Samādhi, which he
LINE 712: recited with an earnestness more impressive in its way than the
LINE 713: dexterous intonation of the professional cleric. Next he visited the
LINE 714: new-born child and took some comfort in the reflection that she
LINE 715: had at least left behind her this memorial of their love. Genji did
LINE 716: not attempt to go even for the day to the Nijō-in, but remained buried
LINE 717: in recollections and regrets with no other occupation save the
LINE 718: ordering of masses for her soul. He did however bring himself to write
LINE 719: a few letters, among them one to Rokujō. The Virgin Elect was already
LINE 720: in charge of the Guardsmen of the Gate and would soon be passed on by
LINE 721: them to the Palace-in-the-Fields. Rokujō accordingly made her
LINE 722: daughter's situation an excuse for sending no reply.[19] He was now so
LINE 723: weary of life and its miseries that he seriously contemplated the
LINE 724: taking of priestly vows, and might perhaps have done so, had there not
LINE 725: been a new bond which seemed to tie him irrevocably to the world. But
LINE 726: stay, there was the girl Murasaki too, waiting for him in the wing of
LINE 727: his palace. How unhappy she must have been during all this long time!
LINE 728: That night lying all alone within his royal curtains, though watchmen
LINE 729: were going their rounds not far away, he felt very lonely and
LINE 730: remembering that 'autumn is no time to lie alone,' he sent for the
LINE 731: sweetest voiced among the chaplains of the palace. His chanting
LINE 732: mingled with the sounds of early dawn was indeed of almost unendurable
LINE 733: beauty. But soon the melancholy of late autumn, the murmur of the
LINE 734: rising wind took possession of him, and little used to lonely nights
LINE 735: he found it hard to keep his bed till morning. Looking out he saw that
LINE 736: a heavy mist lay over the garden beds; yet despite the mist it was
LINE 737: clear that something was tied to the stem of a fine chrysanthemum not
LINE 738: far away. It was a letter written on dark blue paper.[20] The
LINE 739: messenger had left it there and gone away. 'What a charming idea!' he
LINE 740: was thinking when he suddenly recognized the hand. It was from
LINE 741: Rokujō. She began by saying she did not think, having regard to her
LINE 742: daughter's situation, that he would be surprised at her long delay in
LINE 743: answering his previous note. She added an acrostic poem in which,
LINE 744: playing upon the word chrysanthemum (_kiku_) she told him of her
LINE 745: distress at hearing (_kiku_) of his bereavement. 'The beauty of the
LINE 746: morning' she ended, 'turned my thoughts more than ever towards you and
LINE 747: your sorrow; that is why I could not choose but answer you.' It was
LINE 748: written even more elegantly than usual; but he tossed it aside. Her
LINE 749: condolences wounded him, for after what he had seen he knew that they
LINE 750: could not be sincere. Nevertheless he felt that it would be too harsh
LINE 751: to break off all communication with her; that he should do so would in
LINE 752: fact tend to incriminate her, and this was the last thing he desired.
LINE 753: After all, it was probably not _that_ at all which had brought about
LINE 754: the disaster; maybe Aoi's fate was sealed in any case. If only he had
LINE 755: chanced never to see or hear the fatal operation of her spirit! As it
LINE 756: was, argue with himself as he might, he doubted whether he would ever
LINE 757: be able to efface the impression of what had been revealed to him at
LINE 758: that hideous scene.
LINE 759: He had the excuse that he was still in deep mourning and that to
LINE 760: receive a letter from him would inconvenience her at this stage of her
LINE 761: daughter's Purification. But after turning the matter over in his mind
LINE 762: for a long while, he decided that it would be unfeeling not to answer
LINE 763: a letter which had evidently been written with the sole object of
LINE 764: giving him pleasure and on a paper lightly tinted with brown he wrote:
LINE 765: 'Though I have let so many days slip by, believe me that you have not
LINE 766: been absent from my thoughts. If I was reluctant to answer your
LINE 767: letter, it was because, as a mourner, I was loath to trespass upon the
LINE 768: sanctity which now surrounds your home, and this I trusted that
LINE 769: you would understand. Do not brood overmuch upon what has happened;
LINE 770: for "go we late or soon, more frail our lives than dew-drops hanging
LINE 771: in the morning light." For the present, think of it no more. I say
LINE 772: this now, because it is not possible for us to meet.'
LINE 773: She received the letter at her daughter's place of preparation, but
LINE 774: did not read it till she was back in her own house. At a glance she
LINE 775: knew at what he was hinting. So he too accused her! And at last the
LINE 776: hideous conviction of her own guilt forced itself upon her acceptance.
LINE 777: Her misery increased tenfold.
LINE 778: If even Genji had reason to believe in her guilt, her brother-in-law,
LINE 779: the ex-Emperor, must already have been informed. What was he thinking
LINE 780: of her? Her dead husband, Prince Zembō, had been the brother whom he
LINE 781: had loved best. He had accepted the guardianship of the little girl
LINE 782: who was now about to be consecrated and at his brother's earnest
LINE 783: entreaty had promised to undertake her education and indeed treat her
LINE 784: as though she were his own child. The old Emperor had constantly
LINE 785: invited the widowed lady and her daughter to live with him in the
LINE 786: Palace, but she was reluctant to accept this offer, which indeed was
LINE 787: somewhat impracticable. Meanwhile she allowed herself to listen to
LINE 788: Genji's youthful addresses and was soon living in constant torment and
LINE 789: agitation lest her indiscretion should be discovered. During the whole
LINE 790: period of this escapade she was in such a state of mingled excitement
LINE 791: and apprehension that she scarcely knew what she was doing. In the
LINE 792: world at large she had the reputation of being a great beauty
LINE 793: and this, combined with her exalted lineage, brought to the
LINE 794: Palace-in-the-Fields, so soon as it was known that she had repaired
LINE 795: thither with her daughter, a host of frivolous dandies from the Court,
LINE 796: who made it their business to force upon her their fashionable
LINE 797: attentions morning, noon and night. Genji heard of this and did
LINE 798: not blame them. He could only think it was a thousand pities that a
LINE 799: woman endowed with every talent and charm, should take it into her
LINE 800: head that she had done with the world and prepare to remove herself to
LINE 801: so remote a place. He could not help thinking that she would find Ise
LINE 802: extremely dull when she got there.
LINE 803: Though the masses for Aoi's soul were now over, he remained in
LINE 804: retirement till the end of the seven weeks. He was not used to doing
LINE 805: nothing and the time hung heavy on his hands. Often he sent for Tō no
LINE 806: Chūjō to tell him all that was going on in the world, and among much
LINE 807: serious information Chūjō would often seek to distract him by
LINE 808: discussing the strange escapades in which they had sometimes shared.
LINE 809: On one of these occasions he indulged in some jokes at the expense of
LINE 810: the ancient lady-of-the-bedchamber with whom Genji had so indiscreetly
LINE 811: become involved. 'Poor old lady!' Genji protested; 'it is too bad to
LINE 812: make fun of her in this way. Please do not do it.' But all the same he
LINE 813: had to admit to himself that he could never think of her without
LINE 814: smiling. Then Chūjō told him the whole story of how he had followed
LINE 815: and watched him on that autumn night, the first after the full
LINE 816: moon,[21] and many other stories besides of his own adventures and
LINE 817: other people's. But in the end they fell to talking of their common
LINE 818: loss, and agreeing that taken all in all life was but a sad business
LINE 819: they parted in tears.
LINE 820: Some weeks afterwards on a gloomy wet evening Chūjō strode into the
LINE 821: room looking somewhat self-conscious in the light grey winter cloak
LINE 822: and breeches which he was to-day wearing for the first time.[22] Genji
LINE 823: was leaning against the balustrade of the balcony above the main
LINE 824: western door. For a long while he had been gazing at the frost-clad
LINE 825: gardens which surrounded the house. A high wind was blowing and
LINE 826: swift showers dashed against the trees. Near to tears he murmured
LINE 827: to himself the line 'Tell me whether her soul be in the rain or
LINE 828: whether in the clouds above!'[23] And as Chūjō watched him sitting
LINE 829: there, his chin resting upon his hand, he thought the soul of one who
LINE 830: had been wedded to so lovely a youth would not indeed have borne quite
LINE 831: to renounce the scene of her earthly life and must surely be hovering
LINE 832: very near him. Still gazing with eager admiration Chūjō came to
LINE 833: Genji's side. He noticed now that though his friend had not in any
LINE 834: other way abated the plainness of his dress, he had to-day put on a
LINE 835: coloured sash. This streak of deep red showed up against his grey
LINE 836: cloak (which though still a summer one[24] was of darker colour than
LINE 837: that which he had lately been wearing) in so attractive a way that
LINE 838: though the effect was very different from that of the magnificent
LINE 839: attires which Genji had affected in happier days, yet Chūjō could not
LINE 840: for a long while take his eyes off him. At last he too gazed up at the
LINE 841: stormy sky, and remembering the Chinese verse which he had heard Genji
LINE 842: repeat he recited the poem: 'Though to rain her soul be turned, yet
LINE 843: where in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist-wreath which is
LINE 844: she?' And Genji answered: 'Since she whom once we knew beyond the
LINE 845: country of the clouds is fled, two months of storm and darkness now
LINE 846: have seared the wintry earth below.'
LINE 847: The depth of Genji's feeling was evident. Sometimes Chūjō had
LINE 848: thought it was merely dread of the old Emperor's rebukes—coupled with
LINE 849: a sense of obligation towards Aoi's father whose kindness had always
LINE 850: been so marked and also towards the Princess her mother, who had
LINE 851: cherished him with an unfailing patience and fondness—that had made it
LINE 852: difficult for him to break off a relationship which was in fact
LINE 853: becoming very irksome. Often indeed Genji's apparent indifference to
LINE 854: Aoi had been very painful to him. Now it was evident to him that she
LINE 855: had never ceased to hold an important place in his affections, and
LINE 856: this made him deplore more bitterly than ever the tragedy of her early
LINE 857: death. Whatever he did and wherever he went he felt that a light was
LINE 858: gone out of his life and he was very despondent.
LINE 859: Among the withered undergrowth in the garden Genji found to his
LINE 860: delight a few gentians still blossoming and after Chūjō was gone he
LINE 861: plucked some and bade the wet-nurse Saisō give them to the child's
LINE 862: grandmother, together with the verse: 'This gentian flower that
LINE 863: lingered amid the withered grasses of the hedge I send you in
LINE 864: remembrance of the autumn that is passed.' 'To you' he added 'it will
LINE 865: seem a poor thing in contrast to the flowers that are gone.' The
LINE 866: Princess looked at her grandson's innocent smiling face and thought
LINE 867: that in beauty he was not far behind the child she had lost. Already
LINE 868: her tears were pouring faster than a stormy wind shakes down the dry
LINE 869: leaves from a tree, and when she read Genji's message they flowed
LINE 870: faster still. This was her answer: 'New tears, but tears of joy it
LINE 871: brings,—this blossom from a meadow that is now laid waste.'
LINE 872: Still in need of some small employment to distract his thoughts,
LINE 873: though it was already getting dark he began a letter to Princess
LINE 874: Asagao who, he felt sure, must long ago have been told of his
LINE 875: bereavement. Although it was a long time since he had heard from her
LINE 876: he made no reference to their former friendship; his letter was indeed
LINE 877: so formal that he allowed the messenger to read it before he
LINE 878: started. It was written on Chinese paper tinted sky-blue. With it was
LINE 879: the poem 'When I look back upon an autumn fraught with diverse sorrows
LINE 880: I find no dusk dimmed with such tears as I to-night have shed.' He
LINE 881: took great pains with his handwriting and her ladies thought it a
LINE 882: shame that so elegant a note should remain unanswered. In the end she
LINE 883: reached the same conclusion. 'Though my heart goes out towards you in
LINE 884: your affliction,' she answered, 'I see no cause to abandon my
LINE 885: distrust.' And to this she added the poem 'Since I heard that the
LINE 886: mists of autumn had vanished and left desolate winter in your house, I
LINE 887: have thought often of you as I watched the streaming sky.' This was
LINE 888: all, and it was written hastily, but to Genji, who for so long had
LINE 889: received no news from her, it gave as much pleasure as the longest and
LINE 890: most ingenious epistle.
LINE 891: It is in general the unexplored that attracts us, and Genji tended to
LINE 892: fall most deeply in love with those who gave him least encouragement.
LINE 893: The ideal condition for the continuance of his affection was that the
LINE 894: beloved, much occupied elsewhere, should grant him no more than an
LINE 895: occasional favour. There was one[25] who admirably fulfilled these
LINE 896: conditions, but unfortunately her high rank and conspicuous position
LINE 897: in society brought with them too many material difficulties. But
LINE 898: little Murasaki was different. There was no need to bring her up on
LINE 899: this principle. He had not during the long days of his mourning ever
LINE 900: forgotten her and he knew that she must be feeling very dull without
LINE 901: him. But he regarded her merely as an orphan child whose care he had
LINE 902: undertaken and it was a comfort to him to think that here at least was
LINE 903: someone he could leave for a little while without anxiously wondering
LINE 904: all the time whether he would get into trouble.
LINE 905: It was now quite dark, and gathering the people of the house round the
LINE 906: great lamp he got them to tell him stories. There was among them a
LINE 907: gentlewoman named Chūnagon with whom he had for years been secretly in
LINE 908: love. He still felt drawn towards her, but at such a time there could
LINE 909: of course be no thought of any closer tie. Seeing now that he was
LINE 910: looking despondent she came over to him and when they had talked for a
LINE 911: while of various matters at large, Genji said to her: 'During these
LINE 912: last weeks, when all has been quiet in the house, I have grown so used
LINE 913: to the company of you gentlewomen that if a time comes when we can no
LINE 914: longer meet so frequently, I shall miss you very much. That was why I
LINE 915: was feeling particularly depressed; though indeed whichever way I turn
LINE 916: my thoughts I find small matter for consolation!' Here he paused and
LINE 917: some of the ladies shed a few tears. At last one of them said: 'I
LINE 918: know, my Lord, how dark a cloud has fallen upon your life and would
LINE 919: not venture to compare our sorrow with yours. But I would have you
LINE 920: remember what it must mean to us that henceforward you will never....'
LINE 921: 'Do not say never' answered Genji kindly. 'I do not forget my friends
LINE 922: so easily as that. If there are any among you who, mindful of the
LINE 923: past, wish still to serve in this house, they may count upon it that
LINE 924: so long as I live I shall never desert them.' And as he sat gazing
LINE 925: into the lamplight, with tears a-glitter in his eyes, they felt they
LINE 926: were fortunate indeed in having such a protector.
LINE 927: There was among these gentlewomen a little orphan girl who had been
LINE 928: Aoi's favourite among all her maids. Well knowing how desolate the
LINE 929: child must now be feeling he said to her kindly: 'Whose business is it
LINE 930: now but mine to look after little Miss Até?' The girl burst into
LINE 931: tears. In her short tunic, darker than the dresses the others were
LINE 932: wearing, with black neckerchief and dark blue breeches she was a
LINE 933: charming figure. 'I hope' continued Genji 'that there are some who
LINE 934: despite the dull times they are likely to have in this house will
LINE 935: choose, in memory of the past, to devote themselves to the care of the
LINE 936: little prince whom I am leaving behind. If all who knew his mother are
LINE 937: now to be dispersed his plight will be more wretched than before.'
LINE 938: Again he promised never to forget them, but they knew well enough that
LINE 939: his visits would be few and far between, and felt very despondent.
LINE 940: That night he distributed among these waiting-ladies and among all the
LINE 941: servants at the Great Hall according to their rank and condition
LINE 942: various keepsakes and trifles that had belonged to their young
LINE 943: mistress, giving to each whatever he thought most likely to keep her
LINE 944: memory alive, without regard to his own preferences and dislikes in
LINE 945: the household.
LINE 946: He had determined that he could not much longer continue this mode of
LINE 947: life and must soon return to his own palace. While his servants were
LINE 948: dragging out his coach and his gentlemen assembling in front of his
LINE 949: rooms, as though on purpose to delay him a violent rainstorm began,
LINE 950: with a wind that tore the last leaves from the trees and swept them
LINE 951: over the earth with wild rapidity. The gentlemen who had assembled in
LINE 952: front of the house were soon drenched to the skin. He had meant to go
LINE 953: to the Palace, then to the Nijō-in and return to sleep at the Great
LINE 954: Hall. But on such a night this was impossible, and he ordered his
LINE 955: gentlemen to proceed straight to the Nijō-in where he would join them
LINE 956: subsequently. As they trooped off each of them felt (though none of
LINE 957: them was likely to be seeing the Great Hall for by any means the last
LINE 958: time) that to-day a chapter in his life was closed. Both the Minister
LINE 959: and his wife, when they heard that Genji was not returning that night,
LINE 960: also felt that they had reached a new and bitter stage in the progress
LINE 961: of their affliction. To Aoi's mother he sent this letter: 'The
LINE 962: ex-Emperor has expressed a strong desire to see me and I feel bound to
LINE 963: go to the Palace. Though I shall not be absent for many days, yet it
LINE 964: is now so long a time since I left this house that I feel dazed at the
LINE 965: prospect of facing the great world once more. I could not go without
LINE 966: informing you of my departure, but am in no condition to pay you a
LINE 967: visit.' The Princess was still lying with closed eyes, her thoughts
LINE 968: buried in the profoundest gloom. She did not send a reply. Presently
LINE 969: Aoi's father came to Genji's apartments. He found it very hard to bear
LINE 970: up, and during the interview clung fast to his son-in-law's sleeve
LINE 971: with an air of dependence which was pathetic to witness. After much
LINE 972: hesitation he began at last to say: 'We old men are prone to tears
LINE 973: even when small matters are amiss; you must not wonder then that under
LINE 974: the weight of so terrible a sorrow I sometimes find myself breaking
LINE 975: into fits of weeping which I am at a loss to control. At such moments
LINE 976: of weakness and disarray I had rather be where none can see me, and
LINE 977: that is why I have not as yet ventured even to pay my respects to his
LINE 978: Majesty your good father. If opportunity offers, I beg you to explain
LINE 979: this to him. To be left thus desolate in the last years of life is a
LINE 980: sore trial, a very sore trial indeed....' The effort which it cost him
LINE 981: to say these words was distressing for Genji to watch and he hastened
LINE 982: to assure the old Minister that he would make matters right at the
LINE 983: Court. 'Though I do not doubt,' he added, 'that my father has already
LINE 984: guessed the reason of your absence.' As it was still raining heavily
LINE 985: the Minister urged him to start before it grew quite dark. But Genji
LINE 986: would not leave the house till he had taken a last look at the inner
LINE 987: rooms. His father-in-law followed him. In the space beyond Aoi's
LINE 988: curtained seat, packed away behind a screen, some thirty gentlewomen
LINE 989: all clad in dark grey weeds were huddled together, forlorn and tearful.
LINE 990: 'These hapless ladies,' said the Minister, turning to Genji,
LINE 991: 'though they take some comfort in the thought that you are leaving
LINE 992: behind you one whose presence will sometimes draw you to this house,
LINE 993: well know that it will never again be your rightful home, and this
LINE 994: distresses them no less than the loss of their dear mistress. For
LINE 995: years they had hoped against hope that you and she would at last be
LINE 996: reconciled. Consider then how bitter for them must be the day of this,
LINE 997: your final departure.' 'Let them take heart' said Genji; 'for whereas
LINE 998: while my lady was alive I would often of set purpose absent myself
LINE 999: from her in the vain hope that upon my return I should find her less
LINE 1000: harshly disposed towards me, now that she is dead I have no longer any
LINE 1001: cause to shun this house, as soon you shall discover.'
LINE 1002: When he had watched Genji drive away, Aoi's father went to her
LINE 1003: bedroom. All her things were just as she had left them. On a stand in
LINE 1004: front of the bed writing materials lay scattered about. There were
LINE 1005: some papers covered with Genji's handwriting, and these the old man
LINE 1006: clasped with an eagerness that made some of the gentlewomen who had
LINE 1007: followed him smile even in the midst of their grief. The works that
LINE 1008: Genji had written out were all masterpieces of the past, some Chinese,
LINE 1009: some Japanese; some written in cursive, some in full script; they
LINE 1010: constituted indeed an astonishing display of versatile penmanship. The
LINE 1011: Minister gazed with an almost religious awe at these specimens of
LINE 1012: Genji's skill, and the thought that he must henceforth regard the
LINE 1013: young man whom he adored as no longer a member of his household and
LINE 1014: family must at that moment have been very painful to him.
LINE 1015: Among these manuscripts was a copy of Po Chü-i's "Everlasting
LINE 1016: Wrong"[26] and beside the words 'The old pillow, the old coverlet
LINE 1017: with whom shall he now share?' Genji had written the poem: 'Mournful
LINE 1018: her ghost that journeying now to unfamiliar realms must flee the couch
LINE 1019: where we were wont to rest.' While beside the words 'The white petals
LINE 1020: of the frost' he had written: 'The dust shall cover this bed; for no
LINE 1021: longer can I bear to brush from it the nightly dew of my tears.'
LINE 1022: Aoi's ladies were gathered together in groups of two or three in each
LINE 1023: of which some gentlewoman was pouring out her private griefs and
LINE 1024: vexations. 'No doubt, as his Excellency the Minister told us, Prince
LINE 1025: Genji will come to us sometimes, if only to see the child. But for my
LINE 1026: part I doubt whether he will find much comfort in such visits....' So
LINE 1027: one of them was saying to her friends. And soon there were many
LINE 1028: affecting scenes of farewell between them, for it had been decided
LINE 1029: that for the present they were all of them to go back to their homes.
LINE 1030: Meanwhile Genji was with his father in the Palace. 'You are very thin
LINE 1031: in the face,' said the ex-Emperor as soon as he saw him. 'I am afraid
LINE 1032: you have overtaxed your strength by too much prayer and fasting,' and
LINE 1033: in a state of the deepest concern he at once began pressing all kinds
LINE 1034: of viands and cordials upon him, showing with regard to his health and
LINE 1035: indeed his affairs in general a solicitude by which Genji could not
LINE 1036: help feeling touched.
LINE 1037: Late that night he at last arrived at the Nijō-in. Here he found
LINE 1038: everything garnished and swept; his men-servants and maids were
LINE 1039: waiting for him at the door. All the gentlewomen of the household at
LINE 1040: once presented themselves in his apartments. They seemed to have vied
LINE 1041: with one another which should look the gayest and smartest, and their
LINE 1042: finery contrasted pleasantly with the sombre and dispiriting attire of
LINE 1043: the unfortunate ladies whom he had left behind him at the Great Hall.
LINE 1044: Having changed out of his court dress, he went at once to the western
LINE 1045: wing. Not only was Murasaki's winter costume most daintily designed,
LINE 1046: but her pretty waiting-maids and little companions were so handsomely
LINE 1047: equipped as to reflect the greatest credit on Shōnagon's management;
LINE 1048: and he saw with satisfaction that such matters might with perfect
LINE 1049: safety be left in her hands. Murasaki herself was indeed exquisitely
LINE 1050: dressed. 'How tall you have grown since last I saw you!' he said and
LINE 1051: pulled up her little curtain-of-honour. He had been away so long that
LINE 1052: she felt shy with him and turned her head aside. But he would not for
LINE 1053: the world have had her look otherwise than she looked at that moment,
LINE 1054: for as she sat in profile with the lamplight falling upon her face he
LINE 1055: realized with delight that she was becoming the very image of her whom
LINE 1056: from the beginning he had loved best. Coming closer to her side he
LINE 1057: whispered to her: 'Some time or other I want to tell you about all
LINE 1058: that has been happening to me since I went away. But it has all been
LINE 1059: very terrible and I am too tired to speak of it now, so I am going
LINE 1060: away to rest for a little while in my own room. From to-morrow onwards
LINE 1061: you will have me to yourself all day long; in fact, I expect you will
LINE 1062: soon grow quite tired of me.'
LINE 1063: 'So far, so good' thought Shōnagon when she heard this speech. But she
LINE 1064: was still very far from easy in her mind. She knew that there were
LINE 1065: several ladies of very great influence with whom Genji was on terms of
LINE 1066: friendship and she feared that when it came to choosing a second wife,
LINE 1067: he would be far more likely to take one of these than to remember her
LINE 1068: own little mistress; and she was not at all satisfied.
LINE 1069: When Genji had retired to the eastern wing, he sent for a certain Lady
LINE 1070: Chūjō to rub his limbs and then went to bed. Next morning he wrote to
LINE 1071: the nurses of Aoi's child and received from them in reply a touching
LINE 1072: account of its beauty and progress; but the letter served only to
LINE 1073: awaken in him useless memories and regrets. Towards the end of the day
LINE 1074: he felt very restless and the time hung heavily on his hands, but he
LINE 1075: was in no mood to resume his secret rovings and such an idea did not
LINE 1076: even occur to him. In Murasaki none of his hopes had been
LINE 1077: disappointed; she had indeed grown up into as handsome a girl as you
LINE 1078: could wish to see, nor was she any longer at an age when it was
LINE 1079: impossible for him to become her lover. He constantly hinted at this,
LINE 1080: but she did not seem to understand what he meant.
LINE 1081: He still had plenty of time on his hands, and the whole of it was now
LINE 1082: spent in her society. All day long they played together at draughts or
LINE 1083: word-picking, and even in the course of these trivial pursuits she
LINE 1084: showed a quickness of mind and beauty of disposition which continually
LINE 1085: delighted him; but she had been brought up in such rigid seclusion
LINE 1086: from the world that it never once occurred to her to exploit her
LINE 1087: charms in any more adult way.
LINE 1088: Soon the situation became unendurable, and though he knew that she
LINE 1089: would be very much upset he determined somehow or another to get his
LINE 1090: own way.
LINE 1091: There came a morning when the gentleman was already up and about, but
LINE 1092: the young lady was still lying a-bed. Her attendants had no means of
LINE 1093: knowing that anything out of the ordinary had happened, for it had
LINE 1094: always been Genji's habit to go in and out of her room just as he
LINE 1095: chose. They naturally assumed that she was not feeling well and were
LINE 1096: glancing at her with sympathy when Genji arrived carrying a
LINE 1097: writing-box which he slipped behind the bed curtains. He at once
LINE 1098: retired, and the ladies also left the room. Seeing that she was alone
LINE 1099: Murasaki slowly raised her head. There by her pillow was the
LINE 1100: writing-box and tied to it with ribbon, a slender note. Listlessly she
LINE 1101: detached the note and unfolding it read the hastily scribbled poem:
LINE 1102: 'Too long have we deferred this new emprise, who night by night
LINE 1103: till now have lain but with a shift between.'
LINE 1104: That _this_ was what Genji had so long been wanting came to her as a
LINE 1105: complete surprise and she could not think why he should regard the
LINE 1106: unpleasant thing that had happened last night as in some way the
LINE 1107: beginning of a new and more intimate friendship between them. Later in
LINE 1108: the morning he came again. 'Is something the matter with you?' he
LINE 1109: asked. 'I shall be very dull to-day if you cannot play draughts with
LINE 1110: me.' But when he came close to her she only buried herself more deeply
LINE 1111: than ever under the bedclothes. He waited till the room was empty and
LINE 1112: then bending over her he said 'Why are you treating me in this surly
LINE 1113: way? I little expected to find you in so bad a humour this morning.
LINE 1114: The others will think it very strange if you lie here all day,' and he
LINE 1115: pulled aside the scarlet coverlet beneath which she had dived. To his
LINE 1116: astonishment he found that she was bathed in sweat; even the hair that
LINE 1117: hung across her cheeks was dripping wet. 'No! This is too much,' he
LINE 1118: said; 'what a state you have worked yourself up into!' But try as he
LINE 1119: would to coax her back to reason he could not get a word out of her,
LINE 1120: for she was really feeling very vexed with him indeed. 'Very well
LINE 1121: then,' he said at last, 'if that is how you feel I will never come to
LINE 1122: see you again,' and he pretended to be very much mortified and
LINE 1123: humiliated. Turning away, he opened the writing-box to see whether she
LINE 1124: had written any answer to his poem, but of course found none. He
LINE 1125: understood perfectly that her distress was due merely to extreme youth
LINE 1126: and inexperience, and was not at all put out. All day long he sat near
LINE 1127: her trying to win back her confidence, and though he had small success
LINE 1128: he found even her rebuffs in a curious way very endearing.
LINE 1129: At nightfall, it being the Day of the Wild Boar, the festival
LINE 1130: cakes[27] were served. Owing to Genji's bereavement no great display
LINE 1131: was made, but a few were brought round to Murasaki's quarters in an
LINE 1132: elegant picnic-basket. Seeing that the different kinds were all mixed
LINE 1133: up together Genji came out into the front part of the house and
LINE 1134: calling for Koremitsu said to him: 'I want you to take these cakes
LINE 1135: away and bring me some more to-morrow evening; only not nearly so many
LINE 1136: as this, and all of one kind.[28] This is not the right evening for
LINE 1137: them.' He smiled as he said these words and Koremitsu was quick-witted
LINE 1138: enough at once to guess what had happened. He did not however think
LINE 1139: that it would be discreet to congratulate his master in so many words,
LINE 1140: and merely said: 'It is true enough that if you want to make a good
LINE 1141: beginning you must eat your cakes on the proper day. The day of the
LINE 1142: Rat is certainly very much to the purpose.[29] Pray how many am I to
LINE 1143: bring?' When Genji answered 'Divide by three[30] and you will get the
LINE 1144: answer,' Koremitsu was no longer in any doubt, and hastily retired,
LINE 1145: leaving Genji amused at the practised air with which he invariably
LINE 1146: handled matters of this kind. He said nothing to anyone, but returning
LINE 1147: to his private house made the cakes there with his own hands.
LINE 1148: Genji was beginning to despair of ever restoring her confidence and
LINE 1149: good humour. But even now, when she seemed as shy of him as on
LINE 1150: the night when he first stole her from her home, her beauty fascinated
LINE 1151: him and he knew that his love for her in past days had been but a
LINE 1152: particle compared with what he had felt since yesterday.
LINE 1153: How strange a thing is the heart of man! For now it would have seemed
LINE 1154: to him a calamity if even for a single night he had been taken from
LINE 1155: Murasaki's side; and only a little while ago....
LINE 1156: Koremitsu brought the cakes which Genji had ordered very late on the
LINE 1157: following night. He was careful not to entrust them to Shōnagon, for
LINE 1158: he thought that such a commission might embarrass a grown woman.
LINE 1159: Instead, he sent for her daughter Miss Ben and putting all the cakes
LINE 1160: into one large perfume-box he bade her take them secretly to her
LINE 1161: mistress. 'Be sure to put them close by her pillow, for they are lucky
LINE 1162: cakes and must not be left about the house. Promise me not to do
LINE 1163: anything silly with them.' Miss Ben thought all this very odd, but
LINE 1164: tossing her head she answered 'When, pray, did you ever know me to be
LINE 1165: silly,' and she walked off with the box. Being quite a young girl and
LINE 1166: completely innocent as regards matters of this kind she marched
LINE 1167: straight up to her mistress's bed and, remembering Koremitsu's
LINE 1168: instructions, pushed the box through the curtains and lodged it safely
LINE 1169: by the pillow. It seemed to her that there was someone else there as
LINE 1170: well as Murasaki. 'No doubt,' thought she 'Prince Genji has come as
LINE 1171: usual to hear her repeat her lessons.'
LINE 1172: As yet no one in the household save Koremitsu had any knowledge of the
LINE 1173: betrothal. But when next day the box was found by the bed and brought
LINE 1174: into the servant's quarters some of those who were in closest touch
LINE 1175: with their master's affairs at once guessed the secret. Where did
LINE 1176: these little dishes come from, each set on its own little carved
LINE 1177: stand? and who had been at such pains to make these dainty and
LINE 1178: ingenious cakes? Shōnagon, though she was shocked at this casual way
LINE 1179: of slipping into matrimony, was overjoyed to learn that Genji's
LINE 1180: strange patronage of her young mistress had at last culminated in a
LINE 1181: definite act of betrothal, and her eyes brimmed with tears of
LINE 1182: thankfulness and delight. All the same, she thought he might at least
LINE 1183: have taken the trouble to inform her old nurse, and there was a good
LINE 1184: deal of grumbling in the household generally at an outside retainer
LINE 1185: such as Koremitsu having got wind of the matter first.
LINE 1186: During the days that followed he grudged even the short hours of
LINE 1187: attendance which he was obliged to put in at the Palace and in his
LINE 1188: father's rooms, discovering (much to his own surprise) that save in
LINE 1189: her presence he could no longer enjoy a moment's peace. The friends
LINE 1190: whom he had been wont to visit showed themselves both surprised and
LINE 1191: offended by this unexplained neglect, but though he had no wish to
LINE 1192: stand ill with them he now found that even a remote prospect of having
LINE 1193: to absent himself from his palace for a single night was enough to
LINE 1194: throw him quite out of gear; and all the time he was away his spirits
LINE 1195: were at the very lowest ebb and he looked for all the world as though
LINE 1196: he were sickening from some strange illness. To all invitations or
LINE 1197: greetings he invariably replied that he was at present in no fit mood
LINE 1198: for company (which was naturally taken as an allusion to his recent
LINE 1199: loss) or that he must now be gone, for someone with whom he had
LINE 1200: business was already awaiting him.
LINE 1201: The Minister of the Right was aware that his youngest daughter[31] was
LINE 1202: still pining for Prince Genji and he said one day to Princess Kōkiden:
LINE 1203: 'While his wife was alive we were bound of course to discourage her
LINE 1204: friendship with him in every way we could. But the position is now
LINE 1205: quite changed and I feel that as things are there would be much
LINE 1206: to be said for such a match.' But Kōkiden had always hated Genji and
LINE 1207: having herself arranged that her sister should enter the Palace,[32]
LINE 1208: she saw no reason why this plan should suddenly be abandoned. Indeed
LINE 1209: from this moment onwards she became obstinately determined that the
LINE 1210: girl should be given to the Emperor and to no one else. Genji indeed
LINE 1211: still retained a certain partiality towards her; but though it grieved
LINE 1212: him to hear that he had made her unhappy he had not at present any
LINE 1213: spare affection to offer her. Life, he had come to the conclusion, was
LINE 1214: not long enough for diversions and experiments; henceforward he would
LINE 1215: concentrate. He had moreover received a terrible warning of the
LINE 1216: dangers which might accrue from such jealousies and resentments as his
LINE 1217: former way of life had involved. He thought with great tenderness and
LINE 1218: concern of Lady Rokujō's distress; but it was clear to him that he
LINE 1219: must beware of ever again allowing her to regard him as her true haven
LINE 1220: of refuge. If however she would renew their friendship in quite new
LINE 1221: terms, permitting him to enjoy her company and conversation at such
LINE 1222: times as he could conveniently arrange to do so, he saw no reason why
LINE 1223: they should not sometimes meet.
LINE 1224: Society at large knew that someone was living with him, but her
LINE 1225: identity was quite unknown. This was of no consequence; but Genji felt
LINE 1226: that sooner or later he ought to let her father Prince Hyōbukyō know
LINE 1227: what had become of her and decided that before he did so it would be
LINE 1228: best to celebrate her Initiation. This was done privately, but he was
LINE 1229: at pains that every detail of the ceremony should be performed with
LINE 1230: due splendour and solemnity, and though the outside world was not
LINE 1231: invited it was as magnificent an affair as it well could be. But ever
LINE 1232: since their betrothal Murasaki had shown a certain shyness and
LINE 1233: diffidence in his presence. She could not help feeling sorry that
LINE 1234: after all the years during which they had got on so well together and
LINE 1235: been such close friends he should suddenly take this strange idea into
LINE 1236: his head, and whenever her eyes met his she hastily averted them. He
LINE 1237: tried to make a joke of the matter, but to her it was very serious
LINE 1238: indeed and weighed heavily upon her mind. Her changed attitude towards
LINE 1239: him was indeed somewhat comic; but it was also very distressing, and
LINE 1240: one day he said: 'Sometimes it seems as though you had forgotten all
LINE 1241: the long years of our friendship and I had suddenly become as new to
LINE 1242: you as at the start'; and while thus he scolded her the year drew to a
LINE 1243: close. On New Year's Day he paid the usual visits of ceremony to his
LINE 1244: father, to the Emperor and to the Heir Apparent. Next he visited the
LINE 1245: Great Hall. The old Minister made no reference to the new year, but at
LINE 1246: once began to speak of the past. In the midst of his loneliness and
LINE 1247: sorrow he was so deeply moved even by this hasty and long deferred
LINE 1248: visit that though he strove hard to keep his composure it was more
LINE 1249: than he could compass to do. Looking fondly at his son-in-law he
LINE 1250: thought that the passage of each fresh year did but add new beauty to
LINE 1251: this fair face. They went together into the inner rooms, where his
LINE 1252: entry surprised and delighted beyond measure the disconsolate ladies
LINE 1253: who had remained behind. Next they visited the little prince who was
LINE 1254: growing into a fine child; his merry face was indeed a pleasure to
LINE 1255: see. His resemblance to the Heir Apparent was certainly very striking
LINE 1256: and Genji wondered whether it had been noticed.
LINE 1257: Aoi's things were still as she had left them. His New Year clothes had
LINE 1258: as in former years been hung out for him on the clothes-frame. Aoi's
LINE 1259: clothes-frame which stood empty beside it wore a strangely desolate
LINE 1260: air. A letter from the Princess her mother was now brought to him:
LINE 1261: 'To-day,' she said, 'our bereavement was more than ever present
LINE 1262: to my mind, and though touched at the news of your visit, I fear that
LINE 1263: to see you would but awaken unhappy recollections.' 'You will
LINE 1264: remember,' she continued, 'that it was my custom to present you with a
LINE 1265: suit of clothes on each New Year's Day. But in these last months my
LINE 1266: sight has been so dimmed with tears that I fear you will think I have
LINE 1267: matched the colours very ill. Nevertheless I beg that though it be for
LINE 1268: to-day only you will suffer yourself to be disfigured by this
LINE 1269: unfashionable garb ...' and a servant held out before him a second[33]
LINE 1270: suit, which was evidently the one he was expected to wear to-day. The
LINE 1271: under-stuff was of a most unusual pattern and mixture of colours and
LINE 1272: did not at all please him; but he could not allow her to feel that she
LINE 1273: had laboured in vain, and at once put the suit on. It was indeed
LINE 1274: fortunate that he had come to the Great Hall that day, for he could
LINE 1275: see that she had counted on it. In his reply he said: 'Though I came
LINE 1276: with the hope that you would be the first friend I should greet at
LINE 1277: this new springtide, yet now that I am here too many bitter memories
LINE 1278: assail me and I think it wiser that we should not meet.' To this he
LINE 1279: added an acrostic poem in which he said that with the mourning dress
LINE 1280: which he had just discarded so many years of friendship were cast
LINE 1281: aside that were he to come to her[34] he could but weep. To this she
LINE 1282: sent in answer an acrostic poem in which she said that in this new
LINE 1283: season when all things else on earth put on altered hue, one thing
LINE 1284: alone remained as in the months gone by—her longing for the child who
LINE 1285: like the passing year had vanished from their sight.
