LINE 1: Genji the Shining One.... He knew that the bearer of such a name could
LINE 2: not escape much scrutiny and jealous censure and that his lightest
LINE 3: dallyings would be proclaimed to posterity. Fearing then lest he
LINE 4: should appear to after ages as a mere good-for-nothing and trifler,
LINE 5: and knowing that (so accursed is the blabbing of gossips' tongues) his
LINE 6: most secret acts might come to light, he was obliged always to act
LINE 7: with great prudence and to preserve at least the outward appearance of
LINE 8: respectability. Thus nothing really romantic ever happened to him and
LINE 9: Katano no Shōshō[1] would have scoffed at his story.
LINE 10: While he was still a Captain of the Guard and was spending most of his
LINE 11: time at the Palace, his infrequent visits to the Great Hall[2] were
LINE 12: taken as a sign that some secret passion had made its imprint on his
LINE 13: heart. But in reality the frivolous, commonplace, straight-ahead
LINE 14: amours of his companions did not in the least interest him, and it was
LINE 15: a curious trait in his character that when on rare occasions, despite
LINE 16: all resistance, love did gain a hold upon him, it was always in the
LINE 17: most improbable and hopeless entanglement that he became involved.
LINE 18: It was the season of the long rains. For many days there had not been
LINE 19: a fine moment and the Court was keeping a strict fast. The people at
LINE 20: the Great Hall were becoming very impatient of Genji's long residence
LINE 21: at the Palace, but the young lords, who were Court pages, liked
LINE 22: waiting upon Genji better than upon anyone else, always managing to
LINE 23: put out his clothes and decorations in some marvellous new way. Among
LINE 24: these brothers his greatest friend was the Equerry, Tō no Chūjō, with
LINE 25: whom above all other companions of his playtime he found himself
LINE 26: familiar and at ease. This lord too found the house which his
LINE 27: father-in-law, the Minister of the Right, had been at pains to build
LINE 28: for him, somewhat oppressive, while at his father's house he, like
LINE 29: Genji, found the splendours somewhat dazzling, so that he ended by
LINE 30: becoming Genji's constant companion at Court. They shared both studies
LINE 31: and play and were inseparable companions on every sort of occasion, so
LINE 32: that soon all formalities were dispensed with between them and the
LINE 33: inmost secrets of their hearts freely exchanged.
LINE 34: It was on a night when the rain never ceased its dismal downpour.
LINE 35: There were not many people about in the palace and Genji's rooms
LINE 36: seemed even quieter than usual. He was sitting by the lamp, looking at
LINE 37: various books and papers. Suddenly he began pulling some letters out
LINE 38: of the drawers of a desk which stood near by. This aroused Tō no
LINE 39: Chūjō's curiosity. 'Some of them I can show to you' said Genji, 'but
LINE 40: there are others which I had rather....' 'It is just those which I
LINE 41: want to see. Ordinary, commonplace letters are very much alike and I
LINE 42: do not suppose that yours differ much from mine. What I want to see
LINE 43: are passionate letters written in moments of resentment, letters
LINE 44: hinting consent, letters written at dusk....'
LINE 45: He begged so eagerly that Genji let him examine the drawers. It was
LINE 46: not indeed likely that he had put any very important or secret
LINE 47: documents in the ordinary desk; he would have hidden them away much
LINE 48: further from sight. So he felt sure that the letters in these drawers
LINE 49: would be nothing to worry about. After turning over a few of them,
LINE 50: 'What an astonishing variety!' Tō no Chūjō exclaimed and began
LINE 51: guessing at the writers' names, and made one or two good hits. More
LINE 52: often he was wrong and Genji, amused by his puzzled air, said very
LINE 53: little but generally managed to lead him astray. At last he took the
LINE 54: letters back, saying 'But you too must have a large collection. Show
LINE 55: me some of yours, and my desk will open to you with better will.' 'I
LINE 56: have none that you would care to see,' said Tō no Chūjō, and he
LINE 57: continued: 'I have at last discovered that there exists no woman of
LINE 58: whom one can say "Here is perfection. This is indeed she." There are
LINE 59: many who have the superficial art of writing a good running hand, or
LINE 60: if occasion requires of making a quick repartee. But there are few who
LINE 61: will stand the ordeal of any further test. Usually their minds are
LINE 62: entirely occupied by admiration for their own accomplishments, and
LINE 63: their abuse of all rivals creates a most unpleasant impression. Some
LINE 64: again are adored by over-fond parents. These have been since childhood
LINE 65: guarded behind lattice windows[3] and no knowledge of them is allowed
LINE 66: to reach the outer-world, save that of their excellence in some
LINE 67: accomplishment or art; and this may indeed sometimes arouse our
LINE 68: interest. She is pretty and graceful and has not yet mixed at all with
LINE 69: the world. Such a girl by closely copying some model and applying
LINE 70: herself with great industry will often succeed in really mastering one
LINE 71: of the minor and ephemeral arts. Her friends are careful to say
LINE 72: nothing of her defects and to exaggerate her accomplishments, and
LINE 73: while we cannot altogether trust their praise we cannot believe that
LINE 74: their judgment is entirely astray. But when we take steps to test
LINE 75: their statements we are invariably disappointed.'
LINE 76: He paused, seeming to be slightly ashamed of the cynical tone which he
LINE 77: had adopted, and added 'I know my experience is not large, but that is
LINE 78: the conclusion I have come to so far.' Then Genji, smiling: 'And are
LINE 79: there any who lack even one accomplishment?' 'No doubt, but in such a
LINE 80: case it is unlikely that anyone would be successfully decoyed. The
LINE 81: number of those who have nothing to recommend them and of those in
LINE 82: whom nothing but good can be found is probably equal. I divide women
LINE 83: into three classes. Those of high rank and birth are made such a fuss
LINE 84: of and their weak points are so completely concealed that we are
LINE 85: certain to be told that they are paragons. About those of the middle
LINE 86: class everyone is allowed to express his own opinion, and we shall
LINE 87: have much conflicting evidence to sift. As for the lower classes, they
LINE 88: do not concern us.'
LINE 89: The completeness with which Tō no Chūjō disposed of the question
LINE 90: amused Genji, who said 'It will not always be so easy to know into
LINE 91: which of the three classes a woman ought to be put. For sometimes
LINE 92: people of high rank sink to the most abject positions; while others of
LINE 93: common birth rise to be high officers, wear self-important faces,
LINE 94: redecorate the inside of their houses and think themselves as good as
LINE 95: anyone. How are we to deal with such cases?'
LINE 96: At this moment they were joined by Hidari no Uma no Kami and Tō
LINE 97: Shikibu no Jō, who said they had also come to the Palace to keep the
LINE 98: fast. As both of them were great lovers and good talkers, Tō no Chūjō
LINE 99: handed over to them the decision of Genji's question, and in the
LINE 100: discussion which followed many unflattering things were said. Uma
LINE 101: no Kami spoke first. 'However high a lady may rise, if she does not
LINE 102: come of an adequate stock, the world will think very differently of
LINE 103: her from what it would of one born to such honours; but if through
LINE 104: adverse fortune a lady of highest rank finds herself in friendless
LINE 105: misery, the noble breeding of her mind is soon forgotten and she
LINE 106: becomes an object of contempt. I think then that taking all things
LINE 107: into account, we must put such ladies too into the "middle class." But
LINE 108: when we come to classify the daughters of Zuryō,[4] who are sent to
LINE 109: labour at the affairs of distant provinces,—they have such ups and
LINE 110: downs that we may reasonably put them too into the middle class.
LINE 111: 'Then there are Ministers of the third and fourth classes without
LINE 112: Cabinet rank. These are generally thought less of even than the
LINE 113: humdrum, ordinary officials. They are usually of quite good birth, but
LINE 114: have much less responsibility than Ministers of State and consequently
LINE 115: much greater peace of mind. Girls born into such households are
LINE 116: brought up in complete security from want or deprivation of any kind,
LINE 117: and indeed often amid surroundings of the utmost luxury and splendour.
LINE 118: Many of them grow up into women whom it would be folly to despise;
LINE 119: some have been admitted at Court, where they have enjoyed a quite
LINE 120: unexpected success. And of this I could cite many, many instances.'
LINE 121: 'Their success has generally been due to their having a lot of money,'
LINE 122: said Genji smiling. 'You should have known better than to say that,'
LINE 123: said Tō no Chūjō, reproving him, and Uma no Kami went on: 'There are
LINE 124: some whose lineage and reputation are so high that it never occurs to
LINE 125: one that their education could possibly be at fault; yet when we meet
LINE 126: them, we find ourselves exclaiming in despair "How can they have
LINE 127: contrived to grow up like this?"
LINE 128: 'No doubt the perfect woman in whom none of those essentials is
LINE 129: lacking must somewhere exist and it would not startle me to find her.
LINE 130: But she would certainly be beyond the reach of a humble person like
LINE 131: myself, and for that reason I should like to put her in a category of
LINE 132: her own and not to count her in our present classification.
LINE 133: 'But suppose that behind some gateway overgrown with vine-weed, in a
LINE 134: place where no one knows there is a house at all, there should be
LINE 135: locked away some creature of unimagined beauty—with what excitement
LINE 136: should we discover her! The complete surprise of it, the upsetting of
LINE 137: all our wise theories and classifications, would be likely, I think,
LINE 138: to lay a strange and sudden enchantment upon us. I imagine her father
LINE 139: rather large and gruff; her brother, a surly, ill-looking fellow.
LINE 140: Locked away in an utterly blank and uninteresting bed-room she will be
LINE 141: subject to odd flights of fancy, so that in her hands the arts that
LINE 142: others learn as trivial accomplishments will seem strangely full of
LINE 143: meaning and importance; or perhaps in some particular art she will
LINE 144: thrill us by her delightful and unexpected mastery. Such a one may
LINE 145: perhaps be beneath the attention of those of you who are of flawless
LINE 146: lineage. But for my part I find it hard to banish her ...' and here he
LINE 147: looked at Shikibu no Jō, who wondered whether the description had been
LINE 148: meant to apply to his own sisters, but said nothing. 'If it is
LINE 149: difficult to choose even out of the top class ...' thought Genji, and
LINE 150: began to doze.
LINE 151: He was dressed in a suit of soft white silk, with a rough cloak
LINE 152: carelessly slung over his shoulders, with belt and fastenings untied.
LINE 153: In the light of the lamp against which he was leaning he looked so
LINE 154: lovely that one might have wished he were a girl; and they thought
LINE 155: that even Uma no Kami's 'perfect woman,' whom he had placed in a
LINE 156: category of her own, would not be worthy of such a prince as Genji.
LINE 157: The conversation went on. Many persons and things were discussed. Uma
LINE 158: no Kami contended that perfection is equally difficult to find in
LINE 159: other spheres. The sovereign is hard put to it to choose his
LINE 160: ministers. But he at least has an easier task than the husband, for he
LINE 161: does not entrust the affairs of his kingdom to one, two or three
LINE 162: persons alone, but sets up a whole system of superiors and subordinates.
LINE 163: But when the mistress of a house is to be selected, a single
LINE 164: individual must be found who will combine in her person many diverse
LINE 165: qualities. It will not do to be too exacting. Let us be sure that the
LINE 166: lady of our choice possesses certain tangible qualities which we
LINE 167: admire; and if in other ways she falls short of our ideal, we must be
LINE 168: patient and call to mind those qualities which first induced us to
LINE 169: begin our courting.
LINE 170: But even here we must beware; for there are some who in the
LINE 171: selfishness of youth and flawless beauty are determined that not a
LINE 172: dust-flick shall fall upon them. In their letters they choose the most
LINE 173: harmless topics, but yet contrive to colour the very texture of the
LINE 174: written signs with a tenderness that vaguely disquiets us. But such a
LINE 175: one, when we have at last secured a meeting, will speak so low that
LINE 176: she can scarcely be heard, and the few faint sentences that she
LINE 177: murmurs beneath her breath serve only to make her more mysterious than
LINE 178: before. All this may seem to be the pretty shrinking of girlish
LINE 179: modesty; but we may later find that what held her back was the very
LINE 180: violence of her passions.
LINE 181: Or again, where all seems plain sailing, the perfect companion will
LINE 182: turn out to be too impressionable and will upon the most inappropriate
LINE 183: occasions display her affections in so ludicrous a way that we begin
LINE 184: to wish ourselves rid of her.
LINE 185: Then there is the zealous house-wife, who regardless of her appearance
LINE 186: twists her hair behind her ears and devotes herself entirely to the
LINE 187: details of our domestic welfare. The husband, in his comings and
LINE 188: goings about the world, is certain to see and hear many things which
LINE 189: he cannot discuss with strangers, but would gladly talk over with an
LINE 190: intimate who could listen with sympathy and understanding, someone who
LINE 191: could laugh with him or weep if need be. It often happens too that
LINE 192: some political event will greatly perturb or amuse him, and he sits
LINE 193: apart longing to tell someone about it. He suddenly laughs at some
LINE 194: secret recollection or sighs audibly. But the wife only says lightly
LINE 195: 'What is the matter?' and shows no interest.
LINE 196: This is apt to be very trying.
LINE 197: Uma no Kami considered several other cases. But he reached no definite
LINE 198: conclusion and sighing deeply he continued: 'We will then, as I have
LINE 199: suggested, let birth and beauty go by the board. Let her be the
LINE 200: simplest and most guileless of creatures so long as she is honest and
LINE 201: of a peaceable disposition, that in the end we may not lack a place of
LINE 202: trust. And if some other virtue chances to be hers we shall treasure
LINE 203: it as a godsend. But if we discover in her some small defect, it shall
LINE 204: not be too closely scrutinized. And we may be sure that if she is
LINE 205: strong in the virtues of tolerance and amiability her outward
LINE 206: appearance will not be beyond measure harsh.
LINE 207: 'There are those who carry forbearance too far, and affecting not to
LINE 208: notice wrongs which cry out for redress seem to be paragons of misused
LINE 209: fidelity. But suddenly a time comes when such a one can restrain
LINE 210: herself no longer, and leaving behind her a poem couched in pitiful
LINE 211: language and calculated to rouse the most painful sentiments of
LINE 212: remorse, she flies to some remote village in the mountains or some
LINE 213: desolate seashore, and for a long while all trace of her is lost.
LINE 214: 'When I was a boy the ladies-in-waiting used to tell me sad tales of
LINE 215: this kind. I never doubted that the sentiments expressed in them were
LINE 216: real, and I wept profusely. But now I am beginning to suspect that
LINE 217: such sorrows are for the most part affectation. She has left behind
LINE 218: her (this lady whom we are imagining) a husband who is probably still
LINE 219: fond of her; she is making herself very unhappy, and by disappearing
LINE 220: in this way is causing him unspeakable anxiety, perhaps only for the
LINE 221: ridiculous purpose of putting his affection to the test. Then comes
LINE 222: along some admiring friend crying "What a heart! What depth of
LINE 223: feeling!" She becomes more lugubrious than ever, and finally enters a
LINE 224: nunnery. When she decided on this step she was perfectly sincere and
LINE 225: had not the slightest intention of ever returning to the world. Then
LINE 226: some female friend hears of it and "Poor thing" she cries; "in what an
LINE 227: agony of mind must she have been to do this!" and visits her in her
LINE 228: cell. When the husband, who has never ceased to mourn for her, hears
LINE 229: what she has become, he bursts into tears, and some servant or old
LINE 230: nurse, seeing this, bustles off to the nunnery with tales of the
LINE 231: husband's despair, and "Oh Madam, what a shame, what a shame!" Then
LINE 232: the nun, forgetting where and what she is, raises her hand to her head
LINE 233: to straighten her hair, and finds that it has been shorn away. In
LINE 234: helpless misery she sinks to the floor, and do what she will, the
LINE 235: tears begin to flow. Now all is lost; for since she cannot at every
LINE 236: moment be praying for strength, there creeps into her mind the sinful
LINE 237: thought that she did ill to become a nun and so often does she commit
LINE 238: this sin that even Buddha must think her wickeder now than she was
LINE 239: before she took her vows; and she feels certain that these terrible
LINE 240: thoughts are leading her soul to the blackest Hell. But if the _karma_
LINE 241: of their past lives should chance to be strongly weighted against a
LINE 242: parting, she will be found and captured before she has taken her final
LINE 243: vows. In such a case their life will be beyond endurance unless she be
LINE 244: fully determined, come good or ill, this time to close her eyes to all
LINE 245: that goes amiss.
LINE 246: 'Again there are others who must needs be forever mounting guard over
LINE 247: their own and their husband's affections. Such a one, if she sees in
LINE 248: him not a fault indeed but even the slightest inclination to stray,
LINE 249: makes a foolish scene, declaring with indignation that she will have
LINE 250: no more to do with him.
LINE 251: 'But even if a man's fancy should chance indeed to have gone somewhat
LINE 252: astray, yet his earlier affection may still be strong and in the end
LINE 253: will return to its old haunts. Now by her tantrums she has made a rift
LINE 254: that cannot be joined. Whereas she who when some small wrong calls for
LINE 255: silent rebuke, shows by a glance that she is not unaware; but when
LINE 256: some large offence demands admonishment knows how to hint without
LINE 257: severity, will end by standing in her master's affections better than
LINE 258: ever she stood before. For often the sight of our own forbearance will
LINE 259: give our neighbour strength to rule his mutinous affections.
LINE 260: 'But she whose tolerance and forgiveness know no bounds, though this
LINE 261: may seem to proceed from the beauty and amiability of her disposition,
LINE 262: is in fact displaying the shallowness of her feeling: "The unmoored
LINE 263: boat must needs drift with the stream." Are you not of this mind?'
LINE 264: Tō no Chūjō nodded. 'Some' he said 'have imagined that by arousing a
LINE 265: baseless suspicion in the mind of the beloved we can revive a waning
LINE 266: devotion. But this experiment is very dangerous. Those who recommend
LINE 267: it are confident that so long as resentment is groundless one need
LINE 268: only suffer it in silence and all will soon be well. I have observed
LINE 269: however that this is by no means the case.
LINE 270: 'But when all is said and done, there can be no greater virtue in
LINE 271: woman than this: that she should with gentleness and forbearance meet
LINE 272: every wrong whatsoever that falls to her share.' He thought as he said
LINE 273: this of his own sister, Princess Aoi; but was disappointed and piqued
LINE 274: to discover that Genji, whose comments he awaited, was fast asleep.
LINE 275: Uma no Kami was an expert in such discussions and now stood preening
LINE 276: his feathers. Tō no Chūjō was disposed to hear what more he had to say
LINE 277: and was now at pains to humour and encourage him.
LINE 278: 'It is with women' said Uma no Kami 'as it is with the works of
LINE 279: craftsmen. The wood-carver can fashion whatever he will. Yet his
LINE 280: products are but toys of the moment, to be glanced at in jest, not
LINE 281: fashioned according to any precept or law. When times change, the
LINE 282: carver too will change his style and make new trifles to hit the fancy
LINE 283: of the passing day. But there is another kind of artist, who sets more
LINE 284: soberly about his work, striving to give real beauty to the things
LINE 285: which men actually use and to give to them the shapes which tradition
LINE 286: has ordained. This maker of real things must not for a moment be
LINE 287: confused with the carver of idle toys.
LINE 288: 'In the Painters' Workshop too there are many excellent artists chosen
LINE 289: for their proficiency in ink-drawing; and indeed they are all so
LINE 290: clever it is hard to set one above the other. But all of them are at
LINE 291: work on subjects intended to impress and surprise. One paints the
LINE 292: Mountain of Hōrai; another a raging sea-monster riding a storm;
LINE 293: another, ferocious animals from the Land beyond the sea, or faces of
LINE 294: imaginary demons. Letting their fancy run wildly riot they have no
LINE 295: thought of beauty, but only of how best they may astonish the
LINE 296: beholder's eye. And though nothing in their pictures is real, all is
LINE 297: probable. But ordinary hills and rivers, just as they are, houses such
LINE 298: as you may see anywhere, with all their real beauty and harmony of
LINE 299: form—quietly to draw such scenes as this, or to show what lies behind
LINE 300: some intimate hedge that is folded away far from the world, and thick
LINE 301: trees upon some unheroic hill, and all this with befitting care for
LINE 302: composition, proportion, and the like,—such works demand the highest
LINE 303: master's utmost skill and must needs draw the common craftsman into a
LINE 304: thousand blunders. So too in handwriting, we see some who aimlessly
LINE 305: prolong their cursive strokes this way or that, and hope their
LINE 306: flourishes will be mistaken for genius. But true penmanship preserves
LINE 307: in every letter its balance and form, and though at first some letters
LINE 308: may seem but half-formed, yet when we compare them with the copy-books
LINE 309: we find that there is nothing at all amiss.
LINE 310: 'So it is in these trifling matters. And how much the more in judging
LINE 311: of the human heart should we distrust all fashionable airs and graces,
LINE 312: all tricks and smartness, learnt only to please the outward gaze! This
LINE 313: I first understood some while ago, and if you will have patience with
LINE 314: me I will tell you the story.'
LINE 315: So saying, he came and sat a little closer to them, and Genji woke up.
LINE 316: Tō no Chūjō, in wrapt attention, was sitting with his cheek propped
LINE 317: upon his hand. Uma no Kami's whole speech that night was indeed very
LINE 318: much like a chaplain's sermon about the ways of the world, and was
LINE 319: rather absurd. But upon such occasions as this we are easily led on
LINE 320: into discussing our own ideas and most private secrets without the
LINE 321: least reserve.
LINE 322: 'It happened when I was young, and in an even more humble position
LINE 323: than I am to-day' Uma no Kami continued. 'I was in love with a girl
LINE 324: who (like the drudging, faithful wife of whom I spoke a little
LINE 325: while ago) was not a full-sail beauty; and I in my youthful vanity
LINE 326: thought she was all very well for the moment, but would never do for
LINE 327: the wife of so fine a fellow as I. She made an excellent companion in
LINE 328: times when I was at a loose end; but she was of a disposition so
LINE 329: violently jealous, that I could have put up with a little less
LINE 330: devotion if only she had been somewhat less fiercely ardent and
LINE 331: exacting.
LINE 332: 'Thus I kept thinking, vexed by her unrelenting suspicions. But then I
LINE 333: would remember her ceaseless devotion to the interests of one who was
LINE 334: after all a person of no account, and full of remorse I made sure that
LINE 335: with a little patience on my part she would one day learn to school
LINE 336: her jealousy.
LINE 337: 'It was her habit to minister to my smallest wants even before I was
LINE 338: myself aware of them; whatever she felt was lacking in her she strove
LINE 339: to acquire, and where she knew that in some quality of mind she still
LINE 340: fell behind my desires, she was at pains never to show her deficiency
LINE 341: in such a way as might vex me. Thus in one way or another she was
LINE 342: always busy in forwarding my affairs, and she hoped that if all down
LINE 343: to the last dew drop (as they say) were conducted as I should wish,
LINE 344: this would be set down to her credit and help to balance the defects
LINE 345: in her person which meek and obliging as she might be could not (she
LINE 346: fondly imagined) fail to offend me; and at this time she even hid
LINE 347: herself from strangers lest their poor opinion of her looks should put
LINE 348: me out of countenance.
LINE 349: 'I meanwhile, becoming used to her homely looks, was well content with
LINE 350: her character, save for this one article of jealousy; and here she
LINE 351: showed no amendment. Then I began to think to myself "Surely, since
LINE 352: she seems so anxious to please, so timid, there must be some way of
LINE 353: giving her a fright which will teach her a lesson, so that for a while
LINE 354: at least we may have a respite from this accursed business." And
LINE 355: though I knew it would cost me dear, I determined to make a pretence
LINE 356: of giving her up, thinking that since she was so fond of me this would
LINE 357: be the best way to teach her a lesson. Accordingly I behaved with the
LINE 358: greatest coldness to her, and she as usual began her jealous fit and
LINE 359: behaved with such folly that in the end I said to her, "If you want to
LINE 360: be rid for ever of one who loves you dearly, you are going the right
LINE 361: way about it by all these endless poutings over nothing at all. But if
LINE 362: you want to go on with me, you must give up suspecting some deep
LINE 363: intrigue each time you fancy that I am treating you unkindly. Do this,
LINE 364: and you may be sure I shall continue to love you dearly. It may well
LINE 365: be that as time goes on, I shall rise a little higher in the world and
LINE 366: then...."
LINE 367: 'I thought I had managed matters very cleverly, though perhaps in the
LINE 368: heat of the moment I might have spoken somewhat too roughly. She
LINE 369: smiled faintly and answered that if it were only a matter of bearing
LINE 370: for a while with my failures and disappointments, that did not trouble
LINE 371: her at all, and she would gladly wait till I became a person of
LINE 372: consequence. "But it is a hard task" she said "to go on year after
LINE 373: year enduring your coldness and waiting the time when you will at last
LINE 374: learn to behave to me with some decency; and therefore I agree with
LINE 375: you that the time has come when we had better go each his own way."
LINE 376: Then in a fit of wild and uncontrollable jealousy she began to pour
LINE 377: upon me a torrent of bitter reproaches, and with a woman's savagery
LINE 378: she suddenly seized my little finger and bit deep into it. The
LINE 379: unexpected pain was difficult to bear, but composing myself I said
LINE 380: tragically "Now you have put this mark upon me I shall get on worse
LINE 381: than ever in polite society; as for promotion, I shall be considered a
LINE 382: disgrace to the meanest public office and unable to cut a genteel
LINE 383: figure in any capacity, I shall be obliged to withdraw myself
LINE 384: completely from the world. You and I at any rate shall certainly not
LINE 385: meet again," and bending my injured finger as I turned to go, I
LINE 386: recited the verse "As on bent hand I count the times that we have met,
LINE 387: it is not one finger only that bears witness to my pain." And she, all
LINE 388: of a sudden bursting into tears ... "If still in your heart only you
LINE 389: look for pains to count, then were our hands best employed in
LINE 390: parting." After a few more words I left her, not for a moment thinking
LINE 391: that all was over.
LINE 392: 'Days went by, and no news. I began to be restless. One night when I
LINE 393: had been at the Palace for the rehearsal of the Festival music, heavy
LINE 394: sleet was falling; and I stood at the spot where those of us who came
LINE 395: from the Palace had dispersed, unable to make up my mind which way to
LINE 396: go. For in no direction had I anything which could properly be called
LINE 397: a home. I might of course take a room in the Palace precincts; but I
LINE 398: shivered to think of the cheerless grandeur that would surround me.
LINE 399: Suddenly I began to wonder what she was thinking, how she was looking;
LINE 400: and brushing the snow off my shoulders, I set out for her house. I own
LINE 401: I felt uneasy; but I thought that after so long a time her anger must
LINE 402: surely have somewhat abated. Inside the room a lamp showed dimly,
LINE 403: turned to the wall. Some undergarments were hung out upon a large,
LINE 404: warmly-quilted couch, the bed-hangings were drawn up, and I made sure
LINE 405: that she was for some reason actually expecting me. I was priding
LINE 406: myself on having made so lucky a hit, when suddenly, "Not at home!";
LINE 407: and on questioning the maid I learnt that she had but that very night
LINE 408: gone to her parents' home, leaving only a few necessary servants
LINE 409: behind. The fact that she had till now sent no poem or conciliatory
LINE 410: message seemed to show some hardening of heart, and had already
LINE 411: disquieted me. Now I began to fear that her accursed suspiciousness
LINE 412: and jealousy had but been a stratagem to make me grow weary of her,
LINE 413: and though I could recall no further proof of this I fell into great
LINE 414: despair. And to show her that, though we no longer met, I still
LINE 415: thought of her and planned for her, I got her some stuff for a dress,
LINE 416: choosing a most delightful and unusual shade of colour, and a material
LINE 417: that I knew she would be glad to have. "For after all" I thought "she
LINE 418: cannot want to put me altogether out of her head." When I informed her
LINE 419: of this purchase she did not rebuff me nor make any attempt to hide
LINE 420: from me, but to all my questions she answered quietly and composedly,
LINE 421: without any sign that she was ashamed of herself.
LINE 422: 'At last she told me that if I went on as before, she could never
LINE 423: forgive me; but if I would promise to live more quietly she would take
LINE 424: me back again. Seeing that she still hankered after me I determined to
LINE 425: school her a little further yet, and said that I could make no
LINE 426: conditions and must be free to live as I chose. So the tug of war went
LINE 427: on; but it seems that it hurt her far more than I knew, for in a
LINE 428: little while she fell into a decline and died, leaving me aghast at
LINE 429: the upshot of my wanton game. And now I felt that, whatever faults she
LINE 430: might have had, her devotion alone would have made her a fit wife for
LINE 431: me. I remembered how both in trivial talk and in consideration of
LINE 432: important matters she had never once shown herself at a loss, how in
LINE 433: the dyeing of brocades she rivalled the Goddess of Tatsuta who tints
LINE 434: the autumn leaves, and how in needlework and the like she was not less
LINE 435: skilful than Tanabata, the Weaving-lady of the sky.'
LINE 436: Here he stopped, greatly distressed at the recollection of the lady's
LINE 437: many talents and virtues.
LINE 438: 'The Weaving-lady and the Herd boy' said Tō no Chūjō 'enjoy a love
LINE 439: that is eternal. Had she but resembled the Divine Sempstress in
LINE 440: this, you would not, I think, have minded her being a little less
LINE 441: skilful with her needle. I wonder that with this rare creature in mind
LINE 442: you pronounce the world to be so blank a place.'
LINE 443: 'Listen' replied Uma no Kami 'About the same time there was another
LINE 444: lady whom I used to visit. She was of higher birth than the first; her
LINE 445: skill in poetry, cursive writing, and lute-playing, her readiness of
LINE 446: hand and tongue were all marked enough to show that she was not a
LINE 447: woman of trivial nature; and this indeed was allowed by those who knew
LINE 448: her. To add to this she was not ill-looking and sometimes, when I
LINE 449: needed a rest from my unhappy persecutress, I used to visit her
LINE 450: secretly. In the end I found that I had fallen completely in love with
LINE 451: her. After the death of the other I was in great distress. But it was
LINE 452: no use brooding over the past and I began to visit my new lady more
LINE 453: and more often. I soon came to the conclusion that she was frivolous
LINE 454: and I had no confidence that I should have liked what went on when I
LINE 455: was not there to see. I now visited her only at long intervals and at
LINE 456: last decided that she had another lover.
LINE 457: 'It was during the Godless Month,[5] on a beautiful moonlight night.
LINE 458: As I was leaving the Palace I met a certain young courtier, who, when
LINE 459: I told him that I was driving out to spend the night at the
LINE 460: Dainagon's, said that my way was his and joined me. The road passed my
LINE 461: lady's house and here it was that he alighted, saying that he had an
LINE 462: engagement which he should have been very sorry not to fulfil. The
LINE 463: wall was half in ruins and through its gaps I saw the shadowy waters
LINE 464: of the lake. It would not have been easy (for even the moonbeams
LINE 465: seemed to loiter here!) to hasten past so lovely a place, and when he
LINE 466: left his coach I too left mine.
LINE 467: 'At once this man (whom I now knew to be that other lover whose
LINE 468: existence I had guessed) went and sat unconcernedly on the bamboo
LINE 469: skirting of the portico and began to gaze at the moon. The
LINE 470: chrysanthemums were just in full bloom, the bright fallen leaves were
LINE 471: tumbling and tussling in the wind. It was indeed a scene of wonderful
LINE 472: beauty that met our eyes. Presently he took a flute out of the folds
LINE 473: of his dress and began to play upon it. Then putting the flute aside,
LINE 474: he began to murmur "Sweet is the shade"[6] and other catches. Soon a
LINE 475: pleasant-sounding native zithern[7] began to tune up somewhere within
LINE 476: the house and an ingenious accompaniment was fitted to his careless
LINE 477: warblings. Her zithern was tuned to the autumn-mode, and she played
LINE 478: with so much tenderness and feeling that though the music came from
LINE 479: behind closed shutters it sounded quite modern and passionate,[8] and
LINE 480: well accorded with the soft beauty of the moonlight. The courtier was
LINE 481: ravished, and as he stepped forward to place himself right under her
LINE 482: window he turned to me and remarked in a self-satisfied way that
LINE 483: among the fallen leaves no other footstep had left its mark. Then
LINE 484: plucking a chrysanthemum, he sang:
LINE 485: Strange that the music of your lute,
LINE 486: These matchless flowers and all the beauty of the night,
LINE 487: Have lured no other feet to linger at your door!
LINE 488: and then, beseeching her pardon for his halting verses, he begged her
LINE 489: to play again while one was still near who longed so passionately to
LINE 490: hear her. When he had paid her many other compliments, the lady
LINE 491: answered in an affected voice with the verse:
LINE 492: Would that I had some song that might detain
LINE 493: The flute that blends its note
LINE 494: With the low rustling of the autumn leaves.
LINE 495: and after these blandishments, still unsuspecting, she took up the
LINE 496: thirteen-stringed lute, and tuning it to the _Banjiki_ mode[9] she
LINE 497: clattered at the strings with all the frenzy that fashion now demands.
LINE 498: It was a fine performance no doubt, but I cannot say that it made a
LINE 499: very agreeable impression upon me.
LINE 500: 'A man may amuse himself well enough by trifling from time to time
LINE 501: with some lady at the Court; will get what pleasure he can out of it
LINE 502: while he is with her and not trouble his head about what goes on when
LINE 503: he is not there. This lady too I only saw from time to time, but such
LINE 504: was her situation that I had once fondly imagined myself the only
LINE 505: occupant of her thoughts. However that night's work dissolved the last
LINE 506: shred of my confidence, and I never saw her again.
LINE 507: 'These two experiences, falling to my lot while I was still so young,
LINE 508: early deprived me of any hope from women. And since that time my view
LINE 509: of them has but grown the blacker. No doubt to you at your age they
LINE 510: seem very entrancing, these "dew-drops on the grass that fall if they
LINE 511: are touched," these "glittering hailstones that melt if gathered in
LINE 512: the hand." But when you are a little older you will think as I do.
LINE 513: Take my advice in this at least; beware of caressing manners and soft,
LINE 514: entangling ways. For if you are so rash as to let them lead you
LINE 515: astray, you will soon find yourselves cutting a very silly figure
LINE 516: in the world.'
LINE 517: Tō no Chūjō as usual nodded his assent, and Genji's smile seemed such
LINE 518: as to show that he too accepted Uma no Kami's advice. 'Your two
LINE 519: stories were certainly very dismal' he said, laughing. And here Tō no
LINE 520: Chūjō interposed: 'I will tell you a story about myself. There was a
LINE 521: lady whose acquaintance I was obliged to make with great secrecy. But
LINE 522: her beauty well rewarded my pains, and though I had no thought of
LINE 523: making her my wife I grew so fond of her that I soon found I could not
LINE 524: put her out of my head and she seemed to have complete confidence in
LINE 525: me. Such confidence indeed that when from time to time I was obliged
LINE 526: to behave in such a way as might well have aroused her resentment, she
LINE 527: seemed not to notice that anything was amiss, and even when I
LINE 528: neglected her for many weeks, she treated me as though I were still
LINE 529: coming every day. In the end indeed I found this readiness to receive
LINE 530: me whenever and however I came very painful, and determined for the
LINE 531: future to merit her strange confidence.
LINE 532: 'Her parents were dead and this was perhaps why, since I was all she
LINE 533: had in the world, she treated me with such loving meekness, despite
LINE 534: the many wrongs I did her. I must own that my resolution did not last
LINE 535: long, and I was soon neglecting her worse than before. During this
LINE 536: time (I did not hear of it till afterwards) someone who had discovered
LINE 537: our friendship began to send her veiled messages which cruelly
LINE 538: frightened and distressed her. Knowing nothing of the trouble she was
LINE 539: in, although I often thought of her I neither came nor wrote to her
LINE 540: for a long while. Just when she was in her worst despair a child was
LINE 541: born, and at last in her distress she plucked a blossom of the flower
LINE 542: that is called "Child of my Heart" and sent it to me.'
LINE 543: And here Tō no Chūjō's eyes filled with tears.
LINE 544: 'Well' said Genji 'and did she write a message to go with it?' 'Oh
LINE 545: nothing very out-of-the-ordinary' said Tō no Chūjō. 'She wrote:
LINE 546: "Though tattered be the hillman's hedge, deign sometimes to look with
LINE 547: kindness upon the Child-flower that grows so sweetly there." This
LINE 548: brought me to her side. As usual she did not reproach me, but she
LINE 549: looked sad enough, and when I considered the dreary desolation of this
LINE 550: home where every object wore an aspect no less depressing than the
LINE 551: wailing voices of the crickets in the grass, she seemed to me like
LINE 552: some unhappy princess in an ancient story, and wishing her to feel
LINE 553: that it was for the mother's sake and not the child's that I had come,
LINE 554: I answered with a poem in which I called the Child-flower by its other
LINE 555: name "Bed-flower," and she replied with a poem that darkly hinted at
LINE 556: the cruel tempest which had attended this Bed-flower's birth. She
LINE 557: spoke lightly and did not seem to be downright angry with me; and when
LINE 558: a few tears fell she was at great pains to hide them, and seemed more
LINE 559: distressed at the thought that I might imagine her to be unhappy than
LINE 560: actually resentful of my conduct towards her. So I went away with an
LINE 561: easy mind and it was some while before I came again. When at last I
LINE 562: returned she had utterly disappeared, and if she is alive she must be
LINE 563: living a wretched vagrant life. If while I still loved her she had but
LINE 564: shown some outward sign of her resentment, she would not have ended
LINE 565: thus as an outcast and wanderer; for I should never have dared to
LINE 566: leave her so long neglected, and might in the end have acknowledged
LINE 567: her and made her mine forever. The child too was a sweet creature, and
LINE 568: I have spent much time in searching for them, but still without success.
LINE 569: 'It is, I fear, as sorrowful a tale as that which Uma no Kami has told
LINE 570: you. I, unfaithful, thought that I was not missed; and she, still
LINE 571: loved, was in no better case than one whose love is not returned.
LINE 572: I indeed am fast forgetting her; but she, it may be, cannot put me out
LINE 573: of her mind and I fear there may be nights when thoughts that she
LINE 574: would gladly banish burn fiercely in her breast; for now I fancy she
LINE 575: must be living a comfortless and unprotected life.'
LINE 576: 'When all is said and done' said Uma no Kami 'my friend, though I pine
LINE 577: for her now that she is gone, was a sad plague to me while I had her,
LINE 578: and we must own that such a one will in the end be sure to make us
LINE 579: wish ourselves well rid of her. The zithern-player had much talent to
LINE 580: her credit, but was a great deal too light-headed. And your diffident
LINE 581: lady, Tō no Chūjō, seems to me to be a very suspicious case. The world
LINE 582: appears to be so constructed that we shall in the end be always at a
LINE 583: loss to make a reasoned choice; despite all our picking, sifting and
LINE 584: comparing we shall never succeed in finding this in all ways and to
LINE 585: all lengths adorable and impeccable female.'
LINE 586: 'I can only suggest the Goddess Kichijō'[10] said Tō no Chūjō 'and I
LINE 587: fear that intimacy with so holy and majestic a being might prove to be
LINE 588: impracticable.'
LINE 589: At this they all laughed and Tō no Chūjō continued: 'But now it is
LINE 590: Shikibu's turn and he is sure to give us something entertaining. Come
LINE 591: Shikibu, keep the ball rolling!' 'Nothing of interest ever happens to
LINE 592: humble folk like myself' said Shikibu; but Tō no Chūjō scolded him for
LINE 593: keeping them waiting and after reflecting for a while which anecdote
LINE 594: would best suit the company, he began: 'While I was still a student at
LINE 595: the University, I came across a woman who was truly a prodigy of
LINE 596: intelligence. One of Uma no Kami's demands she certainly fulfilled,
LINE 597: for it was possible to discuss with her to advantage both public
LINE 598: matters and the proper handling of one's private affairs. But not only
LINE 599: was her mind capable of grappling with any problems of this kind;
LINE 600: she was also so learned that ordinary scholars found themselves, to
LINE 601: their humiliation, quite unable to hold their own against her.
LINE 602: 'I was taking lessons from her father, who was a Professor. I had
LINE 603: heard that he had several daughters, and some accidental circumstance
LINE 604: made it necessary for me to exchange a word or two with one of them
LINE 605: who turned out to be the learned prodigy of whom I have spoken. The
LINE 606: father, hearing that we had been seen together, came up to me with a
LINE 607: wine-cup in his hand and made an allusion to the poem of The Two
LINE 608: Wives.[11] Unfortunately I did not feel the least inclination towards
LINE 609: the lady. However I was very civil to her; upon which she began to
LINE 610: take an affectionate interest in me and lost no opportunity of
LINE 611: displaying her talents by giving me the most elaborate advice how best
LINE 612: I might advance my position in the world. She sent me marvellous
LINE 613: letters written in a very far-fetched epistolary style and entirely in
LINE 614: Chinese characters; in return for which I felt bound to visit her, and
LINE 615: by making her my teacher I managed to learn how to write Chinese
LINE 616: poems. They were wretched, knock-kneed affairs, but I am still
LINE 617: grateful to her for it. She was not however at all the sort of woman
LINE 618: whom I should have cared to have as a wife, for though there may be
LINE 619: certain disadvantages in marrying a complete dolt, it is even worse to
LINE 620: marry a blue-stocking. Still less do princes like you and Genji
LINE 621: require so huge a stock of intellect and erudition for your support!
LINE 622: Let her but be one to whom the _karma_ of our past lives draws us in
LINE 623: natural sympathy, what matter if now and again her ignorance
LINE 624: distresses us? Come to that, even men seem to me to get along very
LINE 625: well without much learning.'
LINE 626: Here he stopped, but Genji and the rest, wishing to hear the end
LINE 627: of the story, cried out that for their part they found her a most
LINE 628: interesting woman. Shikibu protested that he did not wish to go on
LINE 629: with the story, but at last after much coaxing, pulling a comical wry
LINE 630: face he continued: 'I had not seen her for a long time. When at last
LINE 631: some accident took me to the house, she did not receive me with her
LINE 632: usual informality but spoke to me from behind a tiresome screen. Ha,
LINE 633: Ha, thought I foolishly, she is sulking; now is the time to have a
LINE 634: scene and break with her. I might have known that she was not so
LINE 635: little of a philosopher as to sulk about trifles; she prided herself
LINE 636: on knowing the ways of the world and my inconstancy did not in the
LINE 637: least disturb her.
LINE 638: 'She told me (speaking without the slightest tremor) that having had a
LINE 639: bad cold for some weeks she had taken a strong garlic-cordial, which
LINE 640: had made her breath smell rather unpleasant and that for this reason
LINE 641: she could not come very close to me. But if I had any matter of
LINE 642: special importance to discuss with her she was quite prepared to give
LINE 643: me her attention. All this she had expressed with solemn literary
LINE 644: perfection. I could think of no suitable reply, and with an "at your
LINE 645: service" I rose to go. Then, feeling that the interview had not been
LINE 646: quite a success, she added, raising her voice "Please come again when
LINE 647: my breath has lost its smell." I could not pretend I had not heard. I
LINE 648: had however no intention of prolonging my visit, particularly as the
LINE 649: odour was now becoming definitely unpleasant, and looking cross I
LINE 650: recited the acrostic "On this night marked by the strange behaviour of
LINE 651: the spider, how foolish to bid me come back to-morrow"[12] and calling
LINE 652: over my shoulder "There is no excuse for you"! I ran out of the
LINE 653: room. But she, following me "If night by night and every night we met,
LINE 654: in daytime too I should grow bold to meet you face to face." Here in
LINE 655: the second sentence she had cleverly concealed the meaning "If I had
LINE 656: had any reason to expect you, I should not have eaten garlic."'
LINE 657: 'What a revolting story' cried the young princes, and then, laughing,
LINE 658: 'He must have invented it.' 'Such a woman is quite incredible; it must
LINE 659: have been some sort of ogress. You have shocked us, Shikibu!' and they
LINE 660: looked at him with disapproval. 'You must try to tell us a better
LINE 661: story than that.' 'I do not see how any story could be better' said
LINE 662: Shikibu, and left the room.
LINE 663: 'There is a tendency among men as well as women' said Uma no Kami 'so
LINE 664: soon as they have acquired a little knowledge of some kind, to want to
LINE 665: display it to the best advantage. To have mastered all the
LINE 666: difficulties in the Three Histories and Five Classics is no road to
LINE 667: amiability. But even a woman cannot afford to lack all knowledge of
LINE 668: public and private affairs. Her best way will be without regular study
LINE 669: to pick up a little here and a little there, merely by keeping her
LINE 670: eyes and ears open. Then, if she has her wits at all about her, she
LINE 671: will soon find that she has amassed a surprising store of information.
LINE 672: Let her be content with this and not insist upon cramming her letters
LINE 673: with Chinese characters which do not at all accord with her feminine
LINE 674: style of composition, and will make the recipient exclaim in despair
LINE 675: "If only she could contrive to be a little less mannish!" And many of
LINE 676: these characters, to which she intended the colloquial pronunciation
LINE 677: to be given, are certain to be read as Chinese, and this will give the
LINE 678: whole composition an even more pedantic sound than it deserves. Even
LINE 679: among our ladies of rank and fashion there are many of this sort, and
LINE 680: there are others who, wishing to master the art of verse-making,
LINE 681: in the end allow it to master them, and, slaves to poetry, cannot
LINE 682: resist the temptation, however urgent the business they are about or
LINE 683: however inappropriate the time, to make use of some happy allusion
LINE 684: which has occurred to them, but must needs fly to their desks and work
LINE 685: it up into a poem. On festival days such a woman is very troublesome.
LINE 686: For example on the morning of the Iris Festival, when everyone is busy
LINE 687: making ready to go to the temple, she will worry them by stringing
LINE 688: together all the old tags about the "matchless root"[13] or on the 9th
LINE 689: day of the 9th month, when everyone is busy thinking out some
LINE 690: difficult Chinese poem to fit the rhymes which have been prescribed,
LINE 691: she begins making metaphors about the "dew on the chrysanthemums,"
LINE 692: thus diverting our attention from the far more important business
LINE 693: which is in hand. At another time we might have found these
LINE 694: compositions quite delightful; but by thrusting them upon our notice
LINE 695: at inconvenient moments, when we cannot give them proper attention,
LINE 696: she makes them seem worse than they really are. For in all matters we
LINE 697: shall best commend ourselves if we study men's faces to read in them
LINE 698: the "Why so?" or the "As you will" and do not, regardless of times and
LINE 699: circumstances, demand an interest and sympathy that they have not
LINE 700: leisure to give.
LINE 701: 'Sometimes indeed a woman should even pretend to know less than she
LINE 702: knows, or say only a part of what she would like to say....'
LINE 703: All this while Genji, though he had sometimes joined in the
LINE 704: conversation, had in his heart of hearts been thinking of one person
LINE 705: only, and the more he thought the less could he find a single trace of
LINE 706: those shortcomings and excesses which, so his friends had declared,
LINE 707: were common to all women. 'There is no one like her' he thought,
LINE 708: and his heart was very full. The conversation indeed had not brought
LINE 709: them to a definite conclusion, but it had led to many curious
LINE 710: anecdotes and reflections. So they passed the night, and at last, for
LINE 711: a wonder, the weather had improved. After this long residence at the
LINE 712: Palace Genji knew he would be expected at the Great Hall and set out
LINE 713: at once. There was in Princess Aoi's air and dress a dignified
LINE 714: precision which had something in it even of stiffness; and in the very
LINE 715: act of reflecting that she, above all women, was the type of that
LINE 716: single-hearted and devoted wife whom (as his friends had said last
LINE 717: night) no sensible man would lightly offend, he found himself
LINE 718: oppressed by the very perfection of her beauty, which seemed only to
LINE 719: make all intimacy with her the more impossible.
LINE 720: He turned to Lady Chūnagon, to Nakatsukasa and other attendants of the
LINE 721: common sort who were standing near and began to jest with them. The
LINE 722: day was now very hot, but they thought that flushed cheeks became
LINE 723: Prince Genji very well. Aoi's father came, and standing behind the
LINE 724: curtain, began to converse very amiably. Genji, who considered the
LINE 725: weather too hot for visits, frowned, at which the ladies-in-waiting
LINE 726: tittered. Genji, making furious signs at them to be quiet, flung
LINE 727: himself on to a divan. In fact, he behaved far from well.
LINE 728: It was now growing dark. Someone said that the position of the Earth
LINE 729: Star[14] would make it unlucky for the Prince to go back to the Palace
LINE 730: that night; and another: 'You are right. It is now set dead against
LINE 731: him.' 'But my own palace is in the same direction!' cried Genji. 'How
LINE 732: vexing! where then shall I go?' and promptly fell asleep. The
LINE 733: ladies-in-waiting however, agreed that it was a very serious matter
LINE 734: and began discussing what could be done. 'There is Ki no Kami's
LINE 735: house' said one. This Ki no Kami was one of Genji's gentlemen in
LINE 736: waiting. 'It is in the Middle River' she went on; 'and delightfully
LINE 737: cool and shady, for they have lately dammed the river and made it flow
LINE 738: right through the garden.' 'That sounds very pleasant' said Genji,
LINE 739: waking up, 'besides they are the sort of people who would not mind
LINE 740: one's driving right in at the front gate, if one had a mind to.'[15]
LINE 741: He had many friends whose houses lay out of the unlucky direction. But
LINE 742: he feared that if he went to one of them, Aoi would think that, after
LINE 743: absenting himself so long, he was now merely using the Earth Star as
LINE 744: an excuse for returning to more congenial company. He therefore
LINE 745: broached the matter to Ki no Kami, who accepted the proposal, but
LINE 746: stepping aside whispered to his companions that his father Iyo no
LINE 747: Kami, who was absent on service, had asked him to look after his young
LINE 748: wife.[16] 'I am afraid we have not sufficient room in the house to
LINE 749: entertain him as I could wish.' Genji overhearing this, strove to
LINE 750: reassure him, saying 'It will be a pleasure to me to be near the lady.
LINE 751: A visit is much more agreeable when there is a hostess to welcome us.
LINE 752: Find me some corner behind her partition...!' 'Even then, I fear you
LINE 753: may not find ...' but breaking off Ki no Kami sent a runner to his
LINE 754: house, with orders to make ready an apartment for the Prince. Treating
LINE 755: a visit to so humble a house as a matter of no importance, he started
LINE 756: at once, without even informing the Minister, and taking with him only
LINE 757: a few trusted body-servants. Ki no Kami protested against the
LINE 758: precipitation, but in vain.
LINE 759: The servants dusted and aired the eastern side-chamber of the Central
LINE 760: Hall and here made temporary quarters for the Prince. They were at
LINE 761: pains to improve the view from his windows, for example by altering
LINE 762: the course of certain rivulets. They set up a rustic wattled hedge and
LINE 763: filled the borders with the choicest plants. The low humming of
LINE 764: insects floated on the cool breeze; numberless fireflies wove
LINE 765: inextricable mazes in the air. The whole party settled down near where
LINE 766: the moat flowed under the covered bridge and began to drink wine.
LINE 767: Ki no Kami went off in a great bustle, saying that he must find them
LINE 768: something to eat. Genji, quietly surveying the scene, decided this was
LINE 769: one of those middle-class families which in last night's conversation
LINE 770: had been so highly commended. He remembered that he had heard the lady
LINE 771: who was staying in the house well spoken of and was curious to see
LINE 772: her. He listened and thought that there seemed to be people in the
LINE 773: western wing. There was a soft rustling of skirts, and from time to
LINE 774: time the sound of young and by no means disagreeable voices. They did
LINE 775: not seem to be much in earnest in their efforts to make their
LINE 776: whispering and laughter unheard, for soon one of them opened the
LINE 777: sliding window. But Ki no Kami crying 'What are you thinking of?'
LINE 778: crossly closed it again. The light of a candle in the room filtered
LINE 779: through a crack in the paper-window. Genji edged slightly closer to
LINE 780: the window in the hope of being able to see through the crack, but
LINE 781: found that he could see nothing. He listened for a while, and came to
LINE 782: the conclusion that they were sitting in the main women's apartments,
LINE 783: out of which the little front room opened. They were speaking very
LINE 784: low, but he could catch enough of it to make out that they were
LINE 785: talking about him.
LINE 786: 'What a shame that a fine young Prince should be taken so young and
LINE 787: settled down for ever with a lady that was none of his choosing!'
LINE 788: 'I understand that marriage does not weigh very heavily upon him'
LINE 789: said another. This probably meant nothing in particular, but Genji,
LINE 790: who imagined they were talking about what was uppermost in his own
LINE 791: mind, was appalled at the idea that his relations with Lady Fujitsubo
LINE 792: were about to be discussed. How could they have found out? But the
LINE 793: subsequent conversation of the ladies soon showed that they knew
LINE 794: nothing of the matter at all, and Genji stopped listening. Presently
LINE 795: he heard them trying to repeat the poem which he had sent with a
LINE 796: nose-gay of morning-glory to Princess Asagao, daughter of Prince
LINE 797: Momozono.[17] But they got the lines rather mixed up, and Genji began
LINE 798: to wonder whether the lady's appearance would turn out to be on a
LINE 799: level with her knowledge of prosody.
LINE 800: At this moment Ki no Kami came in with a lamp which he hung on the
LINE 801: wall. Having carefully trimmed it, he offered Genji a tray of fruit.
LINE 802: This was all rather dull and Genji by a quotation from an old
LINE 803: folk-song hinted that he would like to meet Ki no Kami's other guests.
LINE 804: The hint was not taken. Genji began to doze, and his attendants sat
LINE 805: silent and motionless.
LINE 806: There were in the room several charming boys, sons of Ki no Kami, some
LINE 807: of whom Genji already knew as pages at the Palace. There were also
LINE 808: numerous sons of Iyo no Kami; with them was a boy of twelve or
LINE 809: thirteen who particularly caught Genji's fancy. He began asking whose
LINE 810: sons the boys were, and when he came to this one Ki no Kami replied
LINE 811: 'he is the youngest son of the late Chūnagon, who loved him dearly,
LINE 812: but died while this boy was still a child. His sister married my
LINE 813: father and that is why he is living here. He is quick at his books,
LINE 814: and we hope one day to send him to Court, but I fear that his lack
LINE 815: of influence....'
LINE 816: 'Poor child!' said Genji. 'His sister, then, is your step-mother, is
LINE 817: that not so? How strange that you should stand in this relationship
LINE 818: with so young a girl! And now I come to think of it there was some
LINE 819: talk once of her being presented at Court, and I once heard the
LINE 820: Emperor asking what had become of her. How changeable are the fortunes
LINE 821: of the world.' He was trying to talk in a very grown-up way.
LINE 822: 'Indeed, Sir' answered Ki no Kami, 'her subsequent state was humbler
LINE 823: than she had reason to expect. But such is our mortal life. Yes, yes,
LINE 824: and such has it always been. We have our ups and downs—and the women
LINE 825: even more than the men.'
LINE 826: _Genji:_ 'But your father no doubt makes much of her?'
LINE 827: _Ki no Kami:_ 'Makes much of her indeed! You may well say so. She
LINE 828: rules his house, and he dotes on her in so wholesale and extravagant a
LINE 829: fashion that all of us (and I among the foremost) have had occasion
LINE 830: before now to call him to order, but he does not listen.'
LINE 831: _Genji:_ 'How comes it then that he has left her behind in the house
LINE 832: of a fashionable young Courtier? For he looks like a man of prudence
LINE 833: and good sense. But pray, where is she now?'
LINE 834: _Ki no Kami:_ 'The ladies have been ordered to retire to the common
LINE 835: room, but they have not yet finished all their preparations.'
LINE 836: Genji's followers, who had drunk heavily, were now all lying fast
LINE 837: asleep on the verandah. He was alone in his room, but could not get to
LINE 838: sleep. Having at last dozed for a moment, he woke suddenly and noticed
LINE 839: that someone was moving behind the paper-window of the back wall.
LINE 840: This, he thought, must be where she is hiding, and faintly curious
LINE 841: he sauntered in that direction and stood listening. 'Where are you?' I
LINE 842: say 'Where are you?' whispered someone in a quaint, hoarse voice,
LINE 843: which seemed to be that of the boy whom Genji had noticed earlier in
LINE 844: the evening. 'I am lying over here' another voice answered. 'Has the
LINE 845: stranger gone to sleep yet? His room must be quite close to this; but
LINE 846: all the same how far off he seems!' Her sleepy voice was so like the
LINE 847: boy's, that Genji concluded this must be his sister.
LINE 848: 'He is sleeping in the wing, I saw him to-night. All that we have
LINE 849: heard of him is true enough. He is as handsome as can be' whispered
LINE 850: the boy. 'I wish it were to-morrow; I want to see him properly' she
LINE 851: answered drowsily, her voice seeming to come from under the bed
LINE 852: clothes. Genji was rather disappointed that she did not ask more
LINE 853: questions about him. Presently he heard the boy saying 'I am going to
LINE 854: sleep over in the corner-room. How bad the light is' and he seemed to
LINE 855: be trimming the lamp. His sister's bed appeared to be in the corner
LINE 856: opposite the paper-window. 'Where is Chūjō?' she called. 'I am
LINE 857: frightened, I like to have someone close to me.' 'Madam' answered
LINE 858: several voices from the servants' room, 'she is taking her bath in the
LINE 859: lower house. She will be back presently.' When all was quiet again,
LINE 860: Genji slipped back the bolt and tried the door. It was not fastened on
LINE 861: the other side. He found himself in an ante-room with a screen at the
LINE 862: end, beyond which a light glimmered. In the half-darkness he could see
LINE 863: clothes boxes and trunks strewn about in great disorder. Quietly
LINE 864: threading his way among them, he entered the inner room from which the
LINE 865: voices had proceeded. One very minute figure was couched there who, to
LINE 866: Genji's slight embarrassment, on hearing his approach pushed aside the
LINE 867: cloak which covered her, thinking that he was the maid for whom she
LINE 868: had sent. 'Madam, hearing you call for Chūjō[18] I thought that I
LINE 869: might now put at your service the esteem in which I have long secretly
LINE 870: held you.' The lady could make nothing of all this, and terrified out
LINE 871: of her wits tried hard to scream. But no sound came, for she had
LINE 872: buried her face in the bed clothes.
LINE 873: 'Please listen' said Genji. 'This sudden intrusion must of course seem
LINE 874: to you very impertinent. You do not know that for years I have waited
LINE 875: for an occasion to tell you how much I like and admire you, and if
LINE 876: to-night I could not resist the temptation of paying this secret
LINE 877: visit, pray take the strangeness of my behaviour as proof of my
LINE 878: impatience to pay a homage that has long been due.' He spoke so
LINE 879: courteously and gently and looked so kind that not the devil himself
LINE 880: would have taken umbrage at his presence. But feeling that the
LINE 881: situation was not at all a proper one for a married lady she said
LINE 882: (without much conviction) 'I think you have made a mistake.' She spoke
LINE 883: very low. Her bewildered air made her all the more attractive, and
LINE 884: Genji, enchanted by her appearance, hastened to answer: 'Indeed I have
LINE 885: made no mistake; rather, with no guide but a long-felt deference and
LINE 886: esteem, I have found my way unerringly to your side. But I see that
LINE 887: the suddenness of my visit has made you distrust my purpose. Let me
LINE 888: tell you then that I have no evil intentions and seek only for someone
LINE 889: to talk with me for a while about a matter which perplexes me.' So
LINE 890: saying he took her up in his arms (for she was very small) and was
LINE 891: carrying her through the ante-room when suddenly Chūjō, the servant
LINE 892: for whom she had sent before, entered the bedroom. Genji gave an
LINE 893: astonished cry and the maid, wondering who could have entered the
LINE 894: ante-room, began groping her way towards them. But coming closer she
LINE 895: recognized by the rich perfume of his dress that this could be none
LINE 896: other than the Prince. And though she was sorely puzzled to know
LINE 897: what was afoot, she dared not say a word. Had he been an ordinary
LINE 898: person, she would soon have had him by the ears. 'Nay' she thought
LINE 899: 'even if he were not a Prince I should do best to keep my hands off
LINE 900: him; for the more stir one makes, the more tongues wag. But if I
LINE 901: should touch this fine gentleman ...,' and all in a flutter she found
LINE 902: herself obediently following Genji to his room. Here he calmly closed
LINE 903: the door upon her, saying as he did so 'You will come back to fetch
LINE 904: your mistress in the morning.' Utsusemi herself was vexed beyond
LINE 905: measure at being thus disposed of in the presence of her own
LINE 906: waiting-maid, who could indeed draw but one conclusion from what she
LINE 907: had seen. But to all her misgivings and anxieties Genji, who had the
LINE 908: art of improvising a convincing reply to almost any question, answered
LINE 909: with such a wealth of ingenuity and tender concern, that for awhile
LINE 910: she was content. But soon becoming again uneasy, 'This must all be a
LINE 911: dream—that you, so great a Prince, should stoop to consider so humble
LINE 912: a creature as I, and I am overwhelmed by so much kindness. But I think
LINE 913: you have forgotten what I am. A Zuryō's wife! there is no altering
LINE 914: that, and you...!' Genji now began to realize how deeply he had
LINE 915: distressed and disquieted her by his wild behaviour, and feeling
LINE 916: thoroughly ashamed of himself he answered: 'I am afraid I know very
LINE 917: little about these questions of rank and precedence. Such things are
LINE 918: too confusing to carry in one's head. And whatever you may have heard
LINE 919: of me I want to tell you for some reason or other I have till this day
LINE 920: cared nothing for gallantry nor ever practised it, and that even you
LINE 921: cannot be more astonished at what I have done to-night than I myself
LINE 922: am.' With this and a score of other speeches he sought to win her
LINE 923: confidence. But she, knowing that if once their talk became a jot less
LINE 924: formal, she would be hard put to it to withstand his singular
LINE 925: charm, was determined, even at the risk of seeming stiff and awkward,
LINE 926: to show him that in trying so hard to put her at her ease he was only
LINE 927: wasting his time, with the result that she behaved very boorishly
LINE 928: indeed. She was by nature singularly gentle and yielding, so that the
LINE 929: effort of steeling her heart and despite her feelings, playing all the
LINE 930: while the part of the young bamboo-shoot which though so green and
LINE 931: tender cannot be broken, was very painful to her; and finding that she
LINE 932: could not longer think of arguments with which to withstand his
LINE 933: importunity, she burst into tears; and though he was very sorry for
LINE 934: her, it occurred to him that he would not gladly have missed that
LINE 935: sight. He longed however to console her, but could not think of a way
LINE 936: to do so, and said at last, 'Why do you treat me so unkindly? It is
LINE 937: true that the manner of our meeting was strange, yet I think that Fate
LINE 938: meant us to meet. It is harsh that you should shrink from me as though
LINE 939: the World and you had never met.' So he chided her, and she: 'If this
LINE 940: had happened long ago before my troubles, before my lot was cast,
LINE 941: perhaps I should have been glad to take your kindness while it
LINE 942: lasted, knowing that you would soon think better of your strange
LINE 943: condescension. But now that my course is fixed, what can such meetings
LINE 944: bring me save misery and regret? _Tell none that you have seen my
LINE 945: home_' she ended, quoting the old song.[19] 'Small wonder that she is
LINE 946: sad' thought Genji, and he found many a tender way to comfort her. And
LINE 947: now the cock began to crow. Out in the courtyard Genji's men were
LINE 948: staggering to their feet, one crying drowsily 'How I should like to go
LINE 949: to sleep again,' and another 'Make haste there, bring out his Honour's
LINE 950: coach.' Ki no Kami came out into the yard, 'What's all this hurry? It
LINE 951: is only when there are women in his party that a man need hasten
LINE 952: from a refuge to which the Earth star has sent him. Why is his
LINE 953: Highness setting off in the middle of the night?'
LINE 954: Genji was wondering whether such an opportunity would ever occur
LINE 955: again. How would he be able even to send her letters? And thinking of
LINE 956: all the difficulties that awaited him, he became very despondent.
LINE 957: Chūjō arrived to fetch her mistress. For a long while he would not let
LINE 958: her go, and when at last he handed her over, he drew her back to him
LINE 959: saying 'How can I send news to you? For, Madam,' he said raising his
LINE 960: voice that the maid Chūjō might hear 'such love as mine, and such
LINE 961: pitiless cruelty as yours have never been seen in the world before.'
LINE 962: Already the birds were singing in good earnest. She could not forget
LINE 963: that she was no one and he a Prince. And even now, while he was
LINE 964: tenderly entreating her, there came unbidden to her mind the image of
LINE 965: her husband Iyo no Suke, about whom she generally thought either not
LINE 966: at all or with disdain. To think that even in a dream he might see her
LINE 967: now, filled her with shame and terror.
LINE 968: It was daylight. Genji went with her to the partition door. Indoors
LINE 969: and out there was a bustle of feet. As he closed the door upon her, it
LINE 970: seemed to him a barrier that shut him out from all happiness. He
LINE 971: dressed, and went out on to the balcony. A blind in the western wing
LINE 972: was hastily raised. There seemed to be people behind who were looking
LINE 973: at him. They could only see him indistinctly across the top of a
LINE 974: partition in the verandah. Among them was one, perhaps, whose heart
LINE 975: beat wildly as she looked...?
LINE 976: The moon had not set, and though with dwindled light still shone crisp
LINE 977: and clear in the dawn. It was a daybreak of marvellous beauty. But in
LINE 978: the passionless visage of the sky men read only their own comfort or
LINE 979: despair; and Genji, as with many backward glances he went upon his
LINE 980: way, paid little heed to the beauty of the dawn. He would send her a
LINE 981: message? No, even that was utterly impossible. And so, in great
LINE 982: unhappiness he returned to his wife's house.
LINE 983: He would gladly have slept a little, but could not stop trying to
LINE 984: invent some way of seeing her again; or when that seemed hopeless,
LINE 985: imagining to himself all that must now be going on in her mind. She
LINE 986: was no great beauty, Genji reflected, and yet one could not say that
LINE 987: she was ugly. Yes, she was in every sense a member of that Middle
LINE 988: Class upon which Uma no Kami had given them so complete a dissertation.
LINE 989: He stayed for some while at the Great Hall, and finding that, try as
LINE 990: he might, he could not stop thinking about her and longing for her, at
LINE 991: last in despair he sent for Ki no Kami and said to him 'Why do you not
LINE 992: let me have that boy in my service,—the Chūnagon's son, whom I saw at
LINE 993: your house? He is a likely looking boy, and I might make him my
LINE 994: body-servant, or even recommend him to the Emperor.' 'I am sensible of
LINE 995: your kindness' said Ki no Kami, 'I will mention what you have said to
LINE 996: the boy's sister.' This answer irritated Genji, but he continued: 'And
LINE 997: has this lady given you step-brothers my lord?' 'Sir, she has been
LINE 998: married these two years, but has had no child. It seems that in making
LINE 999: this marriage she disobeyed her father's last injunctions, and this
LINE 1000: has set her against her husband.'
LINE 1001: _Genji:_ 'That is sad indeed. I am told that she is not ill-looking.
LINE 1002: Is that so?'
LINE 1003: _Ki no Kami:_ 'I believe she is considered quite passable. But I have
LINE 1004: had very little to do with her. Intimacy between step-children and
LINE 1005: step-parents is indeed proverbially difficult.'
LINE 1006: Five or six days afterwards Ki no Kami brought the boy. He was not
LINE 1007: exactly handsome, but he had great charm and (thought Genji) an air of
LINE 1008: distinction. The Prince spoke very kindly to him and soon completely
LINE 1009: won his heart. To Genji's many questions about his sister he made such
LINE 1010: answers as he could, and when he seemed embarrassed or tongue-tied
LINE 1011: Genji found some less direct way of finding out what he wanted to
LINE 1012: know, and soon put the boy at his ease. For though he vaguely realized
LINE 1013: what was going on and thought it rather odd, he was so young that he
LINE 1014: made no effort to understand it, and without further question carried
LINE 1015: back a letter from Genji to his sister.
LINE 1016: She was so much agitated by the sight of it that she burst into tears
LINE 1017: and, lest her brother should perceive them, held the letter in front
LINE 1018: of her face while she read it. It was very long. Among much else it
LINE 1019: contained the verse 'Would that I might dream that dream again! Alas,
LINE 1020: since first this wish was mine, not once have my eye-lids closed in
LINE 1021: sleep.'
LINE 1022: She had never seen such beautiful writing, and as she read, a haze
LINE 1023: clouded her eyes. What incomprehensible fate had first dragged her
LINE 1024: down to be the wife of a Zuryō, and then for a moment raised her so
LINE 1025: high? Still pondering, she went to her room.
LINE 1026: Next day, Genji again sent for the boy, who went to his sister saying
LINE 1027: 'I am going to Prince Genji. Where is your answer to his letter?'
LINE 1028: 'Tell him' she answered 'that there is no one here who reads such
LINE 1029: letters.' The boy burst out laughing. 'Why, you silly, how could I say
LINE 1030: such a thing to him. He told me himself to be sure to bring an
LINE 1031: answer.' It infuriated her to think that Genji should have thus taken
LINE 1032: the boy into his confidence and she answered angrily, 'He has no
LINE 1033: business to talk to you about such things at your age. If that is
LINE 1034: what you talk about you had better not go to him any more.' 'But he
LINE 1035: sent for me' said the boy, and started off.
LINE 1036: 'I was waiting for you all yesterday' said Genji when the boy
LINE 1037: returned. 'Did you forget to bring the answer? Did you forget to
LINE 1038: come?' The child blushed and made no reply. 'And now?' 'She said
LINE 1039: there is no one at home who reads such letters.' 'How silly, what can
LINE 1040: be the use of saying such things?', and he wrote another letter and
LINE 1041: gave it to the boy, saying: 'I expect you do not know that I used to
LINE 1042: meet your sister before her marriage. She treats me in this scornful
LINE 1043: fashion because she looks upon me as a poor-spirited, defenceless
LINE 1044: creature. Whereas she has now a mighty Deputy Governor to look after
LINE 1045: her. But I hope that you will promise to be my child not his. For he
LINE 1046: is very old, and will not be able to take care of you for long.'
LINE 1047: The boy was quite content with this explanation, and admired Genji
LINE 1048: more than ever. The prince kept him always at his side, even taking
LINE 1049: him to the Palace. And he ordered his Chamberlain to see to it that he
LINE 1050: was provided with a little Court suit. Indeed he treated him just as
LINE 1051: though he were his own child.
LINE 1052: Genji continued to send letters; but she, thinking that the boy, young
LINE 1053: as he was, might easily allow a message to fall into the wrong hands
LINE 1054: and that then she would lose her fair name to no purpose, feeling too
LINE 1055: (that however much he desired it) between persons so far removed in
LINE 1056: rank there could be no lasting union, she answered his letters only in
LINE 1057: the most formal terms.
LINE 1058: Dark though it had been during most of the time they were together,
LINE 1059: she yet had a clear recollection of his appearance, and could not deny
LINE 1060: to herself that she thought him uncommonly handsome. But she very much
LINE 1061: doubted if he on his side really knew what she was like; indeed
LINE 1062: she felt sure that the next time they met he would think her very
LINE 1063: plain and all would be over.
LINE 1064: Genji meanwhile thought about her continually. He was for ever calling
LINE 1065: back to memory each incident of that one meeting, and every
LINE 1066: recollection filled him with longing and despair. He remembered how
LINE 1067: sad she had looked when she spoke to him of herself, and he longed to
LINE 1068: make her happier. He thought of visiting her in secret. But the risk
LINE 1069: of discovery was too great, and the consequences likely to be more
LINE 1070: fatal to her even than to himself.
LINE 1071: He had been many days at the Palace, when at last the Earth Star again
LINE 1072: barred the road to his home. He set out at once, but on the way
LINE 1073: pretended that he had just remembered the unfavourable posture of the
LINE 1074: stars. There was nothing to do but seek shelter again in the house on
LINE 1075: the Middle River. Ki no Kami was surprised but by no means
LINE 1076: ill-pleased, for he attributed Genji's visit to the amenity of the
LINE 1077: little pools and fountains which he had constructed in his garden.
LINE 1078: Genji had told the boy in the morning that he intended to visit the
LINE 1079: Middle River, and since he had now become the Prince's constant
LINE 1080: companion, he was sent for at once to wait upon him in his room. He
LINE 1081: had already given a message to his sister, in which Genji told her of
LINE 1082: his plan. She could not but feel flattered at the knowledge that it
LINE 1083: was on her account he had contrived this ingenious excuse for coming
LINE 1084: to the house. Yet she had, as we have seen, for some reason got it
LINE 1085: into her head that at a leisurely meeting she would not please him as
LINE 1086: she had done at that first fleeting and dreamlike encounter, and she
LINE 1087: dreaded adding a new sorrow to the burden of her thwarted and unhappy
LINE 1088: existence. Too proud to let him think that she had posted herself in
LINE 1089: waiting for him, she said to her servants (while the boy was busy
LINE 1090: in Genji's room) 'I do not care to be at such close quarters with our
LINE 1091: guest, besides I am stiff, and would like to be massaged; I must go
LINE 1092: where there is more room,' and so saying she made them carry her
LINE 1093: things to the maid Chūjō's bedroom in the cross-wing.
LINE 1094: Genji had purposely sent his attendants early to bed, and now that all
LINE 1095: was quiet, he hastened to send her a message. But the boy could not
LINE 1096: find her. At last when he had looked in every corner of the house, he
LINE 1097: tried the cross-wing, and succeeded in tracking her down to Chūjō's
LINE 1098: room. It was too bad of her to hide like this, and half in tears he
LINE 1099: gasped out 'Oh how can you be so horrid? What will he think of you?'
LINE 1100: 'You have no business to run after me like this' she answered angrily,
LINE 1101: 'It is very wicked for children to carry such messages. But' she
LINE 1102: added, 'you may tell him I am not well, that my ladies are with me,
LINE 1103: and I am going to be massaged....' So she dismissed him; but in her
LINE 1104: heart of hearts she was thinking that if such an adventure had
LINE 1105: happened to her while she was still a person of consequence, before
LINE 1106: her father died and left her to shift for herself in the world, she
LINE 1107: would have known how to enjoy it. But now she must force herself to
LINE 1108: look askance at all his kindness. How tiresome he must think her! And
LINE 1109: she fretted so much at not being free to fall in love with him, that
LINE 1110: in the end she was more in love than ever. But then she remembered
LINE 1111: suddenly that her lot had long ago been cast. She was a wife. There
LINE 1112: was no sense in thinking of such things, and she made up her mind once
LINE 1113: and for all never again to let foolish ideas enter her head.
LINE 1114: Genji lay on his bed, anxiously waiting to see with what success so
LINE 1115: young a messenger would execute his delicate mission. When at last the
LINE 1116: answer came, astonished at this sudden exhibition of coldness, he
LINE 1117: exclaimed in deep mortification 'This is a disgrace, a hideous
LINE 1118: disgrace,' and he looked very rueful indeed. For a while he said no
LINE 1119: more, but lay sighing deeply, in great distress. At last he recited
LINE 1120: the poem 'I knew not the nature of the strange tree[20] that stands on
LINE 1121: Sono plain, and when I sought the comfort of its shade, I did but lose
LINE 1122: my road,' and sent it to her. She was still awake, and answered with
LINE 1123: the poem 'Too like am I in these my outcast years to the dim tree that
LINE 1124: dwindles from the traveller's approaching gaze.' The boy was terribly
LINE 1125: sorry for Genji and did not feel sleepy at all, but he was afraid
LINE 1126: people would think his continual excursions very strange. By this
LINE 1127: time, however, everyone else in the house was sound asleep. Genji
LINE 1128: alone lay plunged in the blackest melancholy. But even while
LINE 1129: he was raging at the inhuman stubbornness of her new-found and
LINE 1130: incomprehensible resolve, he found that he could not but admire her
LINE 1131: the more for this invincible tenacity. At last he grew tired of lying
LINE 1132: awake; there was no more to be done. A moment later he had changed his
LINE 1133: mind again, and suddenly whispered to the boy 'Take me to where she is
LINE 1134: hiding!' 'It is too difficult' he said, 'she is locked in and there
LINE 1135: are so many people there. I am afraid to go with you.' 'So be it' said
LINE 1136: Genji, 'but you at least must not abandon me' and he laid the boy
LINE 1137: beside him on his bed. He was well content to find himself lying by
LINE 1138: this handsome young Prince's side, and Genji, we must record, found
LINE 1139: the boy no bad substitute for his ungracious sister.
LINE 1140: [1] The hero of a lost popular romance. It is also referred to by

LINE 1144: continued to live.
LINE 1145: [3] Japanese houses were arranged somewhat differently from ours and
LINE 1146: for many of the terms which constantly recur in this book (_kichō_,
LINE 1147: _sudare_, _sunoko_, etc.) no exact English equivalents can be found.
LINE 1148: In such cases I have tried to use expressions which without being too
LINE 1149: awkward or unfamiliar will give an adequate general idea of what is
LINE 1150: meant.
LINE 1151: [4] Provincial officials. Murasaki herself came of this class.
LINE 1152: [5] The tenth month.
LINE 1153: [6] From the _saibara_ ballad, _The Well of Asuka_: 'Sweet is the

LINE 1162: [10] Goddess of Beauty.
LINE 1163: [11] A poem by Po Chü-i pointing out the advantages of marrying a
LINE 1164: poor wife.
LINE 1165: [12] There is a reference to an old poem which says: 'I know that
LINE 1166: to-night my lover will come to me. The spider's antics prove it
LINE 1167: clearly' Omens were drawn from the behaviour of spiders. There is also
LINE 1168: a pun on _hiru_ 'day' and _hiru_ 'garlic,' so that an ordinary person
LINE 1169: would require a few moments' reflection before understanding the poem.
LINE 1170: [13] The irises used for the Tango festival (5th day of 5th month) had

LINE 1176: [17] We learn later that Genji courted this lady in vain from his

LINE 1178: Murasaki speaks of her as though the reader already knew all about
