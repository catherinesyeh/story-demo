LINE 1: It was at the time when he was secretly visiting the lady of the Sixth
LINE 2: Ward.[1] One day on his way back from the Palace he thought that he
LINE 3: would call upon his foster-mother who, having for a long while been
LINE 4: very ill, had become a nun. She lived in the Fifth Ward. After many
LINE 5: enquiries he managed to find the house; but the front gate was locked
LINE 6: and he could not drive in. He sent one of his servants for Koremitsu,
LINE 7: his foster-nurse's son, and while he was waiting began to examine the
LINE 8: rather wretched looking by-street. The house next door was fenced with
LINE 9: a new paling, above which at one place were four or five panels of
LINE 10: open trellis-work, screened by blinds which were very white and bare.
LINE 11: Through chinks in these blinds a number of foreheads could be seen.
LINE 12: They seemed to belong to a group of ladies who must be peeping with
LINE 13: interest into the street below.
LINE 14: At first he thought they had merely peeped out as they passed; but he
LINE 15: soon realized that if they were standing on the floor they must be
LINE 16: giants. No, evidently they had taken the trouble to climb on to some
LINE 17: table or bed; which was surely rather odd!
LINE 18: He had come in a plain coach with no outriders. No one could possibly
LINE 19: guess who he was, and feeling quite at his ease he leant forward
LINE 20: and deliberately examined the house. The gate, also made of a kind of
LINE 21: trellis-work, stood ajar, and he could see enough of the interior to
LINE 22: realize that it was a very humble and poorly furnished dwelling. For a
LINE 23: moment he pitied those who lived in such a place, but then he
LINE 24: remembered the song 'Seek not in the wide world to find a home; but
LINE 25: where you chance to rest, call that your house'; and again, 'Monarchs
LINE 26: may keep their palaces of jade, for in a leafy cottage two can sleep.'
LINE 27: There was a wattled fence over which some ivy-like creeper spread its
LINE 28: cool green leaves, and among the leaves were white flowers with petals
LINE 29: half unfolded like the lips of people smiling at their own thoughts.
LINE 30: 'They are called Yūgao, "Evening Faces,"' one of his servants told
LINE 31: him; 'how strange to find so lovely a crowd clustering on this
LINE 32: deserted wall!' And indeed it was a most strange and delightful thing
LINE 33: to see how on the narrow tenement in a poor quarter of the town they
LINE 34: had clambered over rickety eaves and gables and spread wherever there
LINE 35: was room for them to grow. He sent one of his servants to pick some.
LINE 36: The man entered at the half-opened door, and had begun to pluck the
LINE 37: flowers, when a little girl in a long yellow tunic came through a
LINE 38: quite genteel sliding door, and holding out towards Genji's servant a
LINE 39: white fan heavily perfumed with incense, she said to him 'Would you
LINE 40: like something to put them on? I am afraid you have chosen a
LINE 41: wretched-looking bunch,' and she handed him the fan. Just as he was
LINE 42: opening the gate on his way back, the old nurse's son Koremitsu came
LINE 43: out of the other house full of apologies for having kept Genji waiting
LINE 44: so long—'I could not find the key of the gate' he said. 'Fortunately
LINE 45: the people of this humble quarter were not likely to recognize you and
LINE 46: press or stare; but I am afraid you must have been very much bored
LINE 47: waiting in this hugger-mugger back street,' and he conducted Genji
LINE 48: into the house. Koremitsu's brother, the deacon, his brother-in-law
LINE 49: Mikawa no Kami and his sister all assembled to greet the Prince,
LINE 50: delighted by a visit with which they had not thought he was ever
LINE 51: likely to honour them again.
LINE 52: The nun too rose from her couch: 'For a long time I had been waiting
LINE 53: to give up the world, but one thing held me back: I wanted you to see
LINE 54: your old nurse just once again as you used to know her. You never came
LINE 55: to see me, and at last I gave up waiting and took my vows. Now, in
LINE 56: reward for the penances which my Order enjoins, I have got back a
LINE 57: little of my health, and having seen my dear young master again, I can
LINE 58: wait with a quiet mind for the Lord Amida's Light,' and in her
LINE 59: weakness she shed a few tears.
LINE 60: 'I heard some days ago' said Genji 'that you were very dangerously
LINE 61: ill, and was in great anxiety. It is sad now to find you in this
LINE 62: penitential garb. You must live longer yet, and see me rise in the
LINE 63: world, that you may be born again high in the ninth sphere of Amida's
LINE 64: Paradise. For they say that those who died with longings unfulfilled
LINE 65: are burdened with an evil Karma in their life to come.'
LINE 66: People such as old nurses regard even the most blackguardly and
LINE 67: ill-favoured foster-children as prodigies of beauty and virtue. Small
LINE 68: wonder then if Genji's nurse, who had played so great a part in his
LINE 69: early life, always regarded her office as immensely honourable and
LINE 70: important, and tears of pride came into her eyes while he spoke to her.
LINE 71: The old lady's children thought it very improper that their mother,
LINE 72: having taken holy orders, should show so lively an interest in a human
LINE 73: career. Certain that Genji himself would be very much shocked, they
LINE 74: exchanged uneasy glances. He was on the contrary deeply touched. 'When
LINE 75: I was a child' he said 'those who were dearest to me were early
LINE 76: taken away, and although there were many who gave a hand to my
LINE 77: upbringing, it was to you only, dear nurse, that I was deeply and
LINE 78: tenderly attached. When I grew up I could not any longer be often in
LINE 79: your company. I have not even been able to come here and see you as
LINE 80: often as I wanted to. But in all the long time which has passed since
LINE 81: I was last here, I have thought a great deal about you and wished that
LINE 82: life did not force so many bitter partings upon us.'
LINE 83: So he spoke tenderly. The princely scent of the sleeve which he had
LINE 84: raised to brush away his tears filled the low and narrow room, and
LINE 85: even the young people, who had till now been irritated by their
LINE 86: mother's obvious pride at having been the nurse of so splendid a
LINE 87: prince, found themselves in tears.
LINE 88: Having arranged for continual masses to be said on the sick woman's
LINE 89: behalf, he took his leave, ordering Koremitsu to light him with a
LINE 90: candle. As they left the house he looked at the fan upon which the
LINE 91: white flowers had been laid. He now saw that there was writing on it,
LINE 92: a poem carelessly but elegantly scribbled: 'The flower that puzzled
LINE 93: you was but the _Yūgao_, strange beyond knowing in its dress of
LINE 94: shining dew.' It was written with a deliberate negligence which seemed
LINE 95: to aim at concealing the writer's status and identity. But for all
LINE 96: that the hand showed a breeding and distinction which agreeably
LINE 97: surprised him. 'Who lives in the house on the left?' he asked.
LINE 98: Koremitsu, who did not at all want to act as a go-between, replied
LINE 99: that he had only been at his mother's for five or six days and had
LINE 100: been so much occupied by her illness that he had not asked any
LINE 101: questions about the neighbours. 'I want to know for a quite harmless
LINE 102: reason' said Genji. 'There is something about this fan which raises a
LINE 103: rather important point. I positively must settle it. You would oblige
LINE 104: me by making enquiries from someone who knows the neighbourhood.'
LINE 105: Koremitsu went at once to the house next door and sent for
LINE 106: the steward. 'This house' the man said 'belongs to a certain
LINE 107: Titular-Prefect. He is living in the country, but my lady is still
LINE 108: here; and as she is young and loves company, her brothers who are in
LINE 109: service at the Court often come here to visit her.' 'And that is about
LINE 110: all one can expect a servant to know' said Koremitsu when he repeated
LINE 111: this information. It occurred at once to Genji that it was one of
LINE 112: these Courtiers who had written the poem. Yes, there was certainly a
LINE 113: self-confident air in the writing. It was by someone whose rank
LINE 114: entitled him to have a good opinion of himself. But he was
LINE 115: romantically disposed; it was too painful to dismiss altogether the
LINE 116: idea that, after all, the verses might really have been meant for him,
LINE 117: and on a folded paper he wrote: 'Could I but get a closer view, no
LINE 118: longer would they puzzle me—the flowers that all too dimly in the
LINE 119: gathering dusk I saw.' This he wrote in a disguised hand and gave to
LINE 120: his servant. The man reflected that though the senders of the fan had
LINE 121: never seen Genji before, yet so well known were his features, that
LINE 122: even the glimpse they had got from the window might easily have
LINE 123: revealed to them his identity. He could imagine the excitement with
LINE 124: which the fan had been despatched and the disappointment when for so
LINE 125: long a time no answer came. His somewhat rudely belated arrival would
LINE 126: seem to them to have been purposely contrived. They would all be agog
LINE 127: to know what was in the reply, and he felt very nervous as he
LINE 128: approached the house.
LINE 129: Meanwhile, lighted only by a dim torch, Genji quietly left his nurse's
LINE 130: home. The blinds of the other house were now drawn and only the
LINE 131: fire-fly glimmer of a candle shone through the gap between them.
LINE 132: When he reached his destination[2] a very different scene met his
LINE 133: eyes. A handsome park, a well-kept garden; how spacious and
LINE 134: comfortable it all was! And soon the magnificent owner of these
LINE 135: splendours had driven from his head all thought of the wooden paling,
LINE 136: the shutters and the flowers.
LINE 137: He stayed longer than he intended, and the sun was already up when he
LINE 138: set out for home. Again he passed the house with the shutters. He had
LINE 139: driven through the quarter countless times without taking the
LINE 140: slightest interest in it; but that one small episode of the fan had
LINE 141: suddenly made his daily passage through these streets an event of
LINE 142: great importance. He looked about him eagerly, and would have liked to
LINE 143: know who lived in all the houses.
LINE 144: For several days Koremitsu did not present himself at Genji's palace.
LINE 145: When at last he came, he explained that his mother was growing much
LINE 146: weaker and it was very difficult for him to get away. Then drawing
LINE 147: nearer, he said in a low voice 'I made some further enquiries, but
LINE 148: could not find out much. It seems that someone came very secretly in
LINE 149: June and has been living there ever since; but who she really is not
LINE 150: even her own servants know. I have once or twice peeped through a hole
LINE 151: in the hedge and caught a glimpse of some young women; but their
LINE 152: skirts were rolled back and tucked in at their belts, so I think they
LINE 153: must have been waiting-maids. Yesterday some while after sunset I saw
LINE 154: a lady writing a letter. Her face was calm, but she looked very
LINE 155: unhappy, and I noticed that some of her women were secretly weeping.'
LINE 156: Genji was more curious than ever.
LINE 157: Though his master was of a rank which brought with it great
LINE 158: responsibilities, Koremitsu knew that in view of his youth and
LINE 159: popularity the young prince would be thought to be positively
LINE 160: neglecting his duty if he did not indulge in a few escapades, and that
LINE 161: everyone would regard his conduct as perfectly natural and proper
LINE 162: even when it was such as they would not have dreamed of permitting to
LINE 163: ordinary people.
LINE 164: 'Hoping to get a little further information,' he said, 'I found an
LINE 165: excuse for communicating with her, and received in reply a very
LINE 166: well-worded answer in a cultivated hand. She must be a girl of quite
LINE 167: good position.' 'You must find out more' said Genji; 'I shall not be
LINE 168: happy till I know all about her.'
LINE 169: Here perhaps was just such a case as they had imagined on that rainy
LINE 170: night: a lady whose outward circumstances seemed to place her in that
LINE 171: 'Lowest Class' which they had agreed to dismiss as of no interest; but
LINE 172: who in her own person showed qualities by no means despicable.
LINE 173: But to return for a moment to Utsusemi. Her unkindness had not
LINE 174: affected him as it would have affected most people. If she had
LINE 175: encouraged him he would soon have regarded the affair as an appalling
LINE 176: indiscretion which he must put an end to at all costs; whereas now he
LINE 177: brooded continually upon his defeat and was forever plotting new ways
LINE 178: to shake her resolution.
LINE 179: He had never, till the day of his visit to the foster-nurse, been
LINE 180: interested in anyone of quite the common classes. But now, since that
LINE 181: rainy night's conversation, he had explored (so it seemed to him)
LINE 182: every corner of society, including in his survey even those categories
LINE 183: which his friends had passed over as utterly remote and improbable. He
LINE 184: thought of the lady who had, so to speak, been thrown into his life as
LINE 185: an extra. With how confiding an air she had promised that she would
LINE 186: wait! He was very sorry about her, but he was afraid that if he wrote
LINE 187: to her Utsusemi might find out and that would prejudice his chances.
LINE 188: He would write to her afterwards....
LINE 189: Suddenly at this point Iyo no Suke himself was announced. He had
LINE 190: just returned from his province, and had lost no time in paying his
LINE 191: respects to the prince. The long journey by boat had made him look
LINE 192: rather swarthy and haggard. 'Really' thought Genji 'he is not at all
LINE 193: an attractive man!' Still it was possible to talk to him; for if a man
LINE 194: is of decent birth and breeding, however broken he may be by age or
LINE 195: misfortune, he will always retain a certain refinement of mind and
LINE 196: manners which prevent him from becoming merely repulsive. They were
LINE 197: beginning to discuss the affairs of Iyo's province and Genji was even
LINE 198: joking with him, when a sudden feeling of embarrassment came over him.
LINE 199: Why should those recollections make him feel so awkward? Iyo no Suke
LINE 200: was quite an old man, it had done him no harm. 'These scruples are
LINE 201: absurd' thought Genji. However, she was right in thinking it was
LINE 202: too queer, too ill-assorted a match; and remembering Uma no Kami's
LINE 203: warnings, he felt that he had behaved badly. Though her unkindness
LINE 204: still deeply wounded him, he was almost glad for Iyo's sake that she
LINE 205: had not relented.
LINE 206: 'My daughter is to be married' Iyo was saying 'And I am going to take
LINE 207: my wife back with me to my province.' Here was a double surprise. At
LINE 208: all costs he must see Utsusemi once again. He spoke with her brother
LINE 209: and the boy discussed the matter with her. It would have been
LINE 210: difficult enough for anyone to have carried on an intrigue with the
LINE 211: prince under such circumstances as these. But for her, so far below
LINE 212: him in rank and beset by new restrictions, it had now become
LINE 213: unthinkable. She could not however bear to lose all contact with him,
LINE 214: and not only did she answer his letters much more kindly than before,
LINE 215: but took pains, though they were written with apparent negligence, to
LINE 216: add little touches that would give him pleasure and make him see that
LINE 217: she still cared for him. All this he noticed, and though he was vexed
LINE 218: that she would not relent towards him, he found it impossible to
LINE 219: put her out of his mind.
LINE 220: As for the other girl, he did not think that she was at all the kind
LINE 221: of person to go on pining for him once she was properly settled with a
LINE 222: husband; and he now felt quite happy about her.
LINE 223: It was autumn. Genji had brought so many complications into his life
LINE 224: that he had for some while been very irregular in his visits to the
LINE 225: Great Hall, and was in great disgrace there. The lady[3] in the grand
LINE 226: mansion was very difficult to get on with; but he had surmounted so
LINE 227: many obstacles in his courtship of her that to give her up the moment
LINE 228: he had won her seemed absurd. Yet he could not deny that the blind
LINE 229: intoxicating passion which possessed him while she was still
LINE 230: unattainable, had almost disappeared. To begin with, she was far too
LINE 231: sensitive; then there was the disparity of their ages,[4] and the
LINE 232: constant dread of discovery which haunted him during those painful
LINE 233: partings at small hours of the morning. In fact, there were too many
LINE 234: disadvantages.
LINE 235: It was a morning when mist lay heavy over the garden. After being many
LINE 236: times roused Genji at last came out of Rokujō's room, looking very
LINE 237: cross and sleepy. One of the maids lifted part of the folding-shutter,
LINE 238: seeming to invite her mistress to watch the prince's departure. Rokujō
LINE 239: pulled aside the bed-curtains and tossing her hair back over her
LINE 240: shoulders looked out into the garden. So many lovely flowers were
LINE 241: growing in the borders that Genji halted for a while to enjoy them.
LINE 242: How beautiful he looked standing there, she thought. As he was nearing
LINE 243: the portico the maid who had opened the shutters came and walked by
LINE 244: his side. She wore a light green skirt exquisitely matched to the
LINE 245: season and place; it was so hung as to show to great advantage
LINE 246: the grace and suppleness of her stride. Genji looked round at her.
LINE 247: 'Let us sit down for a minute on the railing here in the corner,' he
LINE 248: said. 'She seems very shy' he thought, 'but how charmingly her hair
LINE 249: falls about her shoulders,' and he recited the poem: 'Though I would
LINE 250: not be thought to wander heedlessly from flower to flower, yet this
LINE 251: morning's pale convolvulus I fain would pluck!' As he said the lines
LINE 252: he took her hand and she answered with practised ease: 'You hasten, I
LINE 253: observe, to admire the morning flowers while the mist still lies about
LINE 254: them,' thus parrying the compliment by a verse which might be
LINE 255: understood either in a personal or general sense. At this moment a
LINE 256: very elegant page wearing the most bewitching baggy trousers came
LINE 257: among the flowers brushing the dew as he walked, and began to pick a
LINE 258: bunch of the convolvuli. Genji longed to paint the scene.
LINE 259: No one could see him without pleasure. He was like the flowering tree
LINE 260: under whose shade even the rude mountain peasant delights to rest. And
LINE 261: so great was the fascination he exercised that those who knew him
LINE 262: longed to offer him whatever was dearest to them. One who had a
LINE 263: favourite daughter would ask for nothing better than to make her
LINE 264: Genji's handmaiden. Another who had an exquisite sister was ready for
LINE 265: her to serve in his household, though it were at the most menial
LINE 266: tasks. Still less could these ladies who on such occasions as this
LINE 267: were privileged to converse with him and stare at him as much as they
LINE 268: pleased, and were moreover young people of much sensibility—how could
LINE 269: they fail to delight in his company and note with much uneasiness that
LINE 270: his visits were becoming far less frequent than before?
LINE 271: But where have I got to? Ah, yes. Koremitsu had patiently continued
LINE 272: the enquiry with which Genji entrusted him. 'Who the mistress is' he
LINE 273: said, 'I have not been able to discover; and for the most part
LINE 274: she is at great pains not to show herself. But more than once in the
LINE 275: general confusion, when there was the sound of a carriage coming along
LINE 276: past that great row of tenement houses, and all the maid-servants were
LINE 277: peering out into the road, the young lady whom I suppose to be the
LINE 278: mistress of the house slipped out along with them. I could not see her
LINE 279: clearly, but she seemed to be very pretty.
LINE 280: 'One day, seeing a carriage with outriders coming towards the house,
LINE 281: one of the maids rushed off calling out "Ukon, Ukon, come quickly and
LINE 282: look. The Captain's carriage is coming this way." At once a
LINE 283: pleasant-faced lady no longer young, came bustling out. "Quietly,
LINE 284: quietly" she said holding up a warning finger; "how do you know it is
LINE 285: the Captain? I shall have to go and look," and she slipped out. A sort
LINE 286: of rough drawbridge leads from the garden into the lane. In her
LINE 287: excitement the good lady caught her skirt in it and falling flat on
LINE 288: her face almost tumbled into the ditch: "A bad piece of work His
LINE 289: Holiness of Katsuragi[5] made here!" she grumbled; but her curiosity
LINE 290: did not seem to be at all damped and she stared harder than ever at
LINE 291: the approaching carriage. The visitor was dressed in a plain, wide
LINE 292: cloak. He had attendants with him, whose names the excited
LINE 293: servant-girls called out as one after another they came near enough to
LINE 294: be recognized; and the odd thing is that the names were certainly
LINE 295: those of Tō no Chūjō's[6] grooms and pages.'
LINE 296: 'I must see that carriage for myself' said Genji. What if this should
LINE 297: be the very lady whom Chūjō, at the time of that rainy night's
LINE 298: conversation, despaired of rediscovering? Koremitsu, noting that Genji
LINE 299: was listening with particular attention continued: 'I must tell you
LINE 300: that I too have reason to be interested in this house, and while
LINE 301: making enquiries on my own account I discovered that the young lady
LINE 302: always addresses the other girls in the house as though they were her
LINE 303: equals. But when, pretending to be taken in by this comedy, I began
LINE 304: visiting there, I noticed that though the older ladies played their
LINE 305: part very well, the young girls would every now and then curtsey or
LINE 306: slip in a "My Lady" without thinking; whereupon the others would
LINE 307: hasten to cover up the mistake as best they might, saying anything
LINE 308: they could think of to make it appear that there was no mistress among
LINE 309: them,' and Koremitsu laughed as he recollected it.
LINE 310: 'Next time I come to visit your mother' said Genji, 'you must let me
LINE 311: have a chance of peeping at them.' He pictured to himself the queer,
LINE 312: tumbled-down house. She was only living there for the time being; but
LINE 313: all the same she must surely belong to that 'bottom class' which they
LINE 314: had dismissed as having no possible bearing on the discussion. How
LINE 315: amusing it would be to show that they were wrong and that after all
LINE 316: something of interest might be discovered in such a place!
LINE 317: Koremitsu, anxious to carry out his master's every wish and intent
LINE 318: also on his own intrigue, contrived at last by a series of ingenious
LINE 319: stratagems to effect a secret meeting between Genji and the mysterious
LINE 320: lady. The details of the plan by which he brought this about would
LINE 321: make a tedious story, and as is my rule in such cases I have thought
LINE 322: it better to omit them.
LINE 323: Genji never asked her by what name he was to call her, nor did he
LINE 324: reveal his own identity. He came very poorly dressed and—what was most
LINE 325: unusual for him—on foot. But Koremitsu regarded this as too great a
LINE 326: tribute to so unimportant a lady, and insisted upon Genji riding his
LINE 327: horse, while he walked by his side. In doing so he sacrificed his
LINE 328: own feelings; for he too had reasons for wishing to create a good
LINE 329: impression in the house, and he knew that by arriving in this rather
LINE 330: undignified way he would sink in the estimation of the inhabitants.
LINE 331: Fortunately his discomfiture was almost unwitnessed, for Genji took
LINE 332: with him only the one attendant who had on the first occasion plucked
LINE 333: the flowers—a boy whom no one was likely to recognize; and lest
LINE 334: suspicions should be aroused, he did not even take advantage of his
LINE 335: presence in the neighbourhood to call at his foster-nurse's house.
LINE 336: The lady was very much mystified by all these precautions and made
LINE 337: great efforts to discover something more about him. She even sent
LINE 338: someone after him to see where he went to when he left her at
LINE 339: day-break; but he succeeded in throwing his pursuer off the scent and
LINE 340: she was no wiser than before. He was now growing far too fond of her.
LINE 341: He was miserable if anything interfered with his visits; and though he
LINE 342: utterly disapproved of his own conduct and worried a great deal about
LINE 343: it, he soon found that he was spending most of his time at her house.
LINE 344: He knew that at some time or another in their lives even the soberest
LINE 345: people lose their heads in this way; but hitherto he had never really
LINE 346: lost his, or done anything which could possibly have been considered
LINE 347: very wrong. Now to his astonishment and dismay he discovered that even
LINE 348: the few morning hours during which he was separated from her were
LINE 349: becoming unendurable. 'What is it in her that makes me behave like a
LINE 350: madman?' he kept on asking himself. She was astonishingly gentle and
LINE 351: unassuming, to the point even of seeming rather apathetic, rather
LINE 352: deficient perhaps in depth of character and emotion; and though she
LINE 353: had a certain air of girlish inexperience, it was clear that he was
LINE 354: not by any means her first lover; and certainly she was rather
LINE 355: plebeian. What was it exactly that so fascinated him? He asked
LINE 356: himself the question again and again, but found no answer.
LINE 357: She for her part was very uneasy to see him come to her thus in shabby
LINE 358: old hunting-clothes, trying always to hide his face, leaving while it
LINE 359: was still dark and everyone was asleep. He seemed like some
LINE 360: demon-lover in an old ghost-tale, and she was half-afraid. But his
LINE 361: smallest gesture showed that he was someone out of the ordinary, and
LINE 362: she began to suspect that he was a person of high rank, who had used
LINE 363: Koremitsu as his go-between. But Koremitsu obstinately pretended to
LINE 364: know nothing at all about his companion, and continued to amuse
LINE 365: himself by frequenting the house on his own account.
LINE 366: What could it mean? She was dismayed at this strange love-making
LINE 367: with—she knew not whom. But about her too there was something
LINE 368: fugitive, insubstantial. Genji was obsessed by the idea that, just as
LINE 369: she had hidden herself in this place, so one day she would once more
LINE 370: vanish and hide, and he would never be able to find her again. There
LINE 371: was every sign that her residence here was quite temporary. He was
LINE 372: sure that when the time came to move she would not tell him where she
LINE 373: was going. Of course her running away would be proof that she was not
LINE 374: worth bothering about any more, and he ought, thankful for the
LINE 375: pleasure they had had together, simply to leave the matter at that.
LINE 376: But he knew that this was the last thing he would be likely to do.
LINE 377: People were already beginning to be suspicious, and often for several
LINE 378: nights running he was unable to visit her. This became so intolerable
LINE 379: that in his impatience he determined to bring her secretly to the
LINE 380: Nijō-in.[7] There would be an appalling outcry if she were discovered;
LINE 381: but that must be risked.
LINE 382: 'I am going to take you somewhere very nice where no one will disturb
LINE 383: us' he said at last. 'No, No' she cried; 'your ways are so strange, I
LINE 384: should be frightened to go with you.' She spoke in a tone of childish
LINE 385: terror, and Genji answered smiling: 'One or the other of us must be a
LINE 386: fox-in-disguise.[8] Here is a chance to find out which it is!' He
LINE 387: spoke very kindly, and suddenly, in a tone of absolute submission, she
LINE 388: consented to do whatever he thought best. He could not but be touched
LINE 389: at her willingness to follow him in what must appear to her to be the
LINE 390: most hazardous and bizarre adventure. Again he thought of Tō no
LINE 391: Chūjō's story on that rainy night, and could not doubt that this must
LINE 392: indeed be Chūjō's fugitive lady. But he saw that she had some reason
LINE 393: for wishing to avoid all questions about her past, and he restrained
LINE 394: his curiosity. So far as he could see she showed no signs of running
LINE 395: away; nor did he believe that she would do so as long as he was
LINE 396: faithful. Tō no Chūjō, after all, had for months on end left her to
LINE 397: her own devices. But he felt that if for an instant she suspected him
LINE 398: of the slightest leaning in any other direction it would be a bad
LINE 399: business.
LINE 400: It was the fifteenth night of the eighth month. The light of an
LINE 401: unclouded full-moon shone between the ill-fitting planks of the roof
LINE 402: and flooded the room. What a queer place to be lying in! thought
LINE 403: Genji, as he gazed round the garret, so different from any room he had
LINE 404: ever known before. It must be almost day. In the neighbouring houses
LINE 405: people were beginning to stir, and there was an uncouth sound of
LINE 406: peasant voices: 'Eh! how cold it is! I can't believe we shall do much
LINE 407: with the crops this year.' 'I don't know what's going to happen about
LINE 408: my carrying-trade' said another; 'things look very bad.' Then (banging
LINE 409: on the wall of another house) 'Wake up, neighbour. Time to start.
LINE 410: Did he hear, d'you think?' and they rose and went off each to the
LINE 411: wretched task by which he earned his bread.
LINE 412: All this clatter and bustle going on so near her made the lady very
LINE 413: uncomfortable, and indeed so dainty and fastidious a person must often
LINE 414: in this miserable lodging have suffered things which would make her
LINE 415: long to sink through the floor. But however painful, disagreeable or
LINE 416: provoking were the things that happened, she gave no sign of noticing
LINE 417: them. That being herself so shrinking and delicate in her ways she
LINE 418: could yet endure without a murmur the exasperating banging and bumping
LINE 419: that was going on in every direction, aroused his admiration, and he
LINE 420: felt that this was much nicer of her than if she had shuddered with
LINE 421: horror at each sound. But now, louder than thunder, came the noise of
LINE 422: the threshing-mills, seeming so near that they could hardly believe it
LINE 423: did not come from out of the pillow itself. Genji thought that his
LINE 424: ears would burst. What many of the noises were he could not at all
LINE 425: make out; but they were very peculiar and startling. The whole air
LINE 426: seemed to be full of crashings and bangings. Now from one side, now
LINE 427: from another, came too the faint thud of the bleacher's mallet, and
LINE 428: the scream of wild geese passing overhead. It was all too distracting.
LINE 429: Their room was in the front of the house. Genji got up and opened the
LINE 430: long, sliding shutters. They stood together looking out. In the
LINE 431: courtyard near them was a clump of fine Chinese bamboos; dew lay thick
LINE 432: on the borders, glittering here no less brightly than in the great
LINE 433: gardens to which Genji was better accustomed. There was a confused
LINE 434: buzzing of insects. Crickets were chirping in the wall. He had often
LINE 435: listened to them, but always at a distance; now, singing so close to
LINE 436: him, they made a music which was unfamiliar and indeed seemed far
LINE 437: lovelier than that with which he was acquainted. But then,
LINE 438: everything in this place where one thing was so much to his liking,
LINE 439: seemed despite all drawbacks to take on a new tinge of interest and
LINE 440: beauty. She was wearing a white bodice with a soft, grey cloak over
LINE 441: it. It was a poor dress, but she looked charming and almost
LINE 442: distinguished; even so, there was nothing very striking in her
LINE 443: appearance—only a certain fragile grace and elegance. It was when she
LINE 444: was speaking that she looked really beautiful, there was such pathos,
LINE 445: such earnestness in her manner. If only she had a little more spirit!
LINE 446: But even as she was he found her irresistible and longed to take her
LINE 447: to some place where no one could disturb them: 'I am going to take you
LINE 448: somewhere not at all far away where we shall be able to pass the rest
LINE 449: of the night in peace. We cannot go on like this, parting always at
LINE 450: break of day.' 'Why have you suddenly come to that conclusion?' she
LINE 451: asked, but she spoke submissively. He vowed to her that she should be
LINE 452: his love in this and in all future lives and she answered so
LINE 453: passionately that she seemed utterly transformed from the listless
LINE 454: creature he had known, and it was hard to believe that such vows were
LINE 455: no novelty to her.
LINE 456: Discarding all prudence he sent for the maid Ukon and bade her order
LINE 457: his servants to fetch a coach. The affair was soon known to all the
LINE 458: household, and the ladies were at first somewhat uneasy at seeing
LINE 459: their mistress carried off in this fashion; but on the whole they did
LINE 460: not think he looked the sort of person who would do her any harm. It
LINE 461: was now almost daylight. The cocks had stopped crowing. The voice of
LINE 462: an old man (a pilgrim preparing for the ascent of the Holy Mountain)
LINE 463: sounded somewhere not far away; and, as at each prayer he bent forward
LINE 464: to touch the ground with his head, they could hear with what pain and
LINE 465: difficulty he moved. What could he be asking for in his prayers, this
LINE 466: old man whose life seemed fragile as the morning dew? Namu tōrai
LINE 467: no dōshi 'Glory be to the Saviour that shall come': now they could
LINE 468: hear the words. 'Listen' said Genji tenderly, 'is not that an omen
LINE 469: that our love shall last through many lives to come? 'And he recited
LINE 470: the poem: 'Do not prove false this omen of the pilgrim's chant: that
LINE 471: even in lives to come our love shall last unchanged.'
LINE 472: Then unlike the lovers in the 'Everlasting Wrong' who prayed that they
LINE 473: might be as the 'twin birds that share a wing' (for they remembered
LINE 474: that this story had ended very sadly) they prayed 'May our love last
LINE 475: till Maitreya comes as a Buddha into the World.' But she, still
LINE 476: distrustful, answered his poem with the verse: 'Such sorrow have I
LINE 477: known in this world that I have small hope of worlds to come.' Her
LINE 478: versification was still a little tentative.[9]
LINE 479: She was thinking with pleasure that the setting moon would light them
LINE 480: on their way, and Genji was just saying so when suddenly the moon
LINE 481: disappeared behind a bank of clouds. But there was still great beauty
LINE 482: in the dawning sky. Anxious to be gone before it was quite light, he
LINE 483: hurried her away to the coach and put Ukon by her side.
LINE 484: They drove to an untenanted mansion which was not far off. While he
LINE 485: waited for the steward to come out Genji noticed that the gates were
LINE 486: crumbling away; dense shinobu-grass grew around them. So sombre an
LINE 487: entrance he had never seen. There was a thick mist and the dew was so
LINE 488: heavy that when he raised the carriage-blind his sleeve was drenched.
LINE 489: 'Never yet has such an adventure as this befallen me' said Genji; 'so
LINE 490: I am, as you may imagine, rather excited,' and he made a poem in which
LINE 491: he said that though love's folly had existed since the beginning of
LINE 492: the world, never could man have set out more rashly at the break of
LINE 493: day into a land unknown. 'But to you this is no great novelty?'
LINE 494: She blushed and in her turn made a poem: 'I am as the moon that walks
LINE 495: the sky not knowing what menace the cruel hills may hold in store;
LINE 496: high though she sweeps, her light may suddenly be blotted out.'
LINE 497: She seemed very depressed and nervous. But this he attributed to the
LINE 498: fact that she had probably always lived in small houses where
LINE 499: everything was huddled together, and he was amused at the idea that
LINE 500: this large mansion should overawe her. They drove in, and while a room
LINE 501: was being got ready they remained in the carriage which had been drawn
LINE 502: up alongside of the balustrade. Ukon, looking very innocent all the
LINE 503: while, was inwardly comparing this excursion with her mistress's
LINE 504: previous adventures. She had noticed the tone of extreme deference
LINE 505: with which this latest lover had been received by the steward, and had
LINE 506: begun to draw her own conclusions.
LINE 507: The mist was gradually clearing away. They left the coach and went
LINE 508: into the room which had been prepared for them. Though so quickly
LINE 509: improvised, their quarters were admirably clean and well-provided, for
LINE 510: the steward's son had previously been a trusted house-servant of
LINE 511: Genji's and had also worked at the Great Hall. Coming now to their
LINE 512: room he offered to send for some of Genji's gentlemen, 'For' he said
LINE 513: 'I cannot bear to see you going unattended.' 'Do nothing of the kind'
LINE 514: said Genji; 'I have come here because I do not wish to be disturbed.
LINE 515: No one but yourself is to know that I have used this house,' and he
LINE 516: exacted a promise of absolute secrecy. No regular meal had been
LINE 517: prepared, but the steward brought them a little rice porridge. Then
LINE 518: they lay down again to sleep together for the first time in this
LINE 519: unfamiliar and so strangely different place.
LINE 520: The sun was high when they woke. Genji went and opened the shutters
LINE 521: himself. How deserted the garden looked! Certainly here there was no
LINE 522: one to spy upon them. He looked out into the distance: dense
LINE 523: woods fast turning to jungle. And nearer the house not a flower or
LINE 524: bush, but only unkempt, autumn grasslands, and a pond choked with
LINE 525: weeds. It was a wild and desolate place. It seemed that the steward
LINE 526: and his men must live in some outbuilding or lodge at a distance from
LINE 527: the house; for here there was no sign or sound of life. 'It is, I must
LINE 528: own, a strange and forsaken place to which we have come. But no ghost
LINE 529: or evil fairy will dare molest you while _I_ am here.'
LINE 530: It pained her very much that he still was masked;[10] and indeed such
LINE 531: a precaution was quite out of keeping with the stage at which they had
LINE 532: now arrived. So at last, reciting a poem in which he reminded her that
LINE 533: all their love down to this moment when 'the flower opened its petals
LINE 534: to the evening dew' had come from a chance vision seen casually from
LINE 535: the street, half-turning his face away, for a moment he let her see
LINE 536: him unmasked. 'What of the "shining dew"' he asked using the words
LINE 537: that she had written on the fan. 'How little knew I of its beauty who
LINE 538: had but in the twilight doubted and guessed...!'; so she answered his
LINE 539: poem in a low and halting voice. She need not have feared, for to him,
LINE 540: poor as the verses were, they seemed delightful. And indeed the beauty
LINE 541: of his uncovered face, suddenly revealed to her in this black
LINE 542: wilderness of dereliction and decay, surpassed all loveliness that she
LINE 543: had ever dreamed of or imagined. 'I cannot wonder that while I still
LINE 544: set this barrier between us, you did not choose to tell me all that I
LINE 545: longed to know. But now it would be very unkind of you not to tell me
LINE 546: your name.' 'I am like the fisherman's daughter in the song'[11] she
LINE 547: said, '"I have no name or home."' But for all that she would not tell
LINE 548: him who she was, she seemed much comforted that he had let her
LINE 549: see him. 'Do as you please about it' said Genji at last; but for a
LINE 550: while he was out of temper. Soon they had made it up again; and so the
LINE 551: day passed. Presently Koremitsu came to their quarters, bringing fruit
LINE 552: and other viands. He would not come in, for he was frightened that
LINE 553: Ukon would rate him mercilessly for the part he had played in
LINE 554: arranging the abduction of her mistress. He had now come to the
LINE 555: conclusion that the Lady must possess charms which he had wholly
LINE 556: overlooked, or Genji would certainly never have taken all this trouble
LINE 557: about her, and he was touched at his own magnanimity in surrendering
LINE 558: to his master a prize which he might well have kept for himself. It
LINE 559: was an evening of marvellous stillness. Genji sat watching the sky.
LINE 560: The lady found the inner room where she was sitting depressingly dark
LINE 561: and gloomy. He raised the blinds of the front room, and came to sit
LINE 562: with her. They watched the light of the sunset glowing in each other's
LINE 563: eyes, and in her wonder at his adorable beauty and tenderness she
LINE 564: forgot all her fears. At last she was shy with him no longer, and he
LINE 565: thought that the new-found boldness and merriment became her very
LINE 566: well. She lay by his side till night. He saw that she was again
LINE 567: wearing the plaintive expression of a frightened child; so quickly
LINE 568: closing the partition-door he brought in the great lamp, saying:
LINE 569: 'Outwardly you are no longer shy with me; but I can see that deep down
LINE 570: in your heart there is still some sediment of rancour and distrust. It
LINE 571: is not kind to use me so,' and again he was cross with her.
LINE 572: What were the people at the Palace thinking? Would he have been sent
LINE 573: for? How far would the messengers pursue their search? He became quite
LINE 574: agitated. Then there was the great lady in the Sixth Ward.[12] What a
LINE 575: frenzy she must be in! This time, however, she really had good
LINE 576: cause to be jealous. These and other unpleasant considerations were
LINE 577: crowding into his head, when looking at the girl who lay beside him so
LINE 578: trustfully, unconscious of all that was going on in his mind, he was
LINE 579: suddenly filled with an overwhelming tenderness towards her. How
LINE 580: tiresome the other was, with her eternal susceptibilities, jealousies
LINE 581: and suspicions! For a while at any rate he would stop seeing her. As
LINE 582: the night wore on they began sometimes to doze. Suddenly Genji saw
LINE 583: standing over him the figure of a woman, tall and majestic: 'You who
LINE 584: think yourself so fine, how comes it that you have brought to toy with
LINE 585: you here this worthless common creature, picked up at random in the
LINE 586: streets? I am astonished and displeased,' and with this she made as
LINE 587: though to drag the lady from his side. Thinking that this was some
LINE 588: nightmare or hallucination, he roused himself and sat up. The lamp had
LINE 589: gone out. Somewhat agitated he drew his sword and laid it beside him,
LINE 590: calling as he did so for Ukon. She came at once, looking a good deal
LINE 591: scared herself. 'Please wake the watchman in the cross-wing,' he said,
LINE 592: 'and tell him to bring a candle.' 'All in the dark like this? How can
LINE 593: I?' she answered. 'Don't be childish,' said Genji laughing and clapped
LINE 594: his hands.[13] The sound echoed desolately through the empty house. He
LINE 595: could not make anyone hear; and meanwhile he noticed that his mistress
LINE 596: was trembling from head to foot. What should he do? He was still
LINE 597: undecided, when suddenly she burst out into a cold sweat. She seemed
LINE 598: to be losing consciousness. 'Do not fear, Sir' said Ukon 'all her life
LINE 599: she has been subject to these nightmare fits.' He remembered now how
LINE 600: tired she had seemed in the morning and how she had lain with her eyes
LINE 601: turned upwards as though in pain. 'I will go myself and wake someone'
LINE 602: he said; 'I am tired of clapping with only echoes to answer me.
LINE 603: Do not leave her!' and drawing Ukon towards the bed he went in the
LINE 604: direction of the main western door. But when he opened it, he found
LINE 605: that the lamp in the cross-wing had also gone out. A wind had risen.
LINE 606: The few attendants he had brought with him were already in bed. There
LINE 607: was indeed only the steward's son (the young man who had once been
LINE 608: Genji's body-servant), and the one young courtier who had attended him
LINE 609: on all his visits. They answered when he called and sprang to their
LINE 610: feet. 'Come with a candle,' he said to the steward's son, 'and tell my
LINE 611: man to get his bow and keep on twanging the string as loud as he can.
LINE 612: I wonder anyone should sleep so soundly in such a deserted place. What
LINE 613: has happened to Koremitsu?' 'He waited for some time, but as you
LINE 614: seemed to have no need of him, he went home, saying he would be back
LINE 615: at day-break.'
LINE 616: Genji's man had been an Imperial Bowman, and making a tremendous din
LINE 617: with his bow he strode towards the steward's lodge crying 'Fire, Fire'
LINE 618: at the top of his voice. The twanging of the bow reminded Genji of the
LINE 619: Palace. The roll-call of night courtiers must be over; the Bowman's
LINE 620: roll-call must be actually going on. It was not so very late.
LINE 621: He groped his way back into the room. She was lying just as he had
LINE 622: left her, with Ukon face downwards beside her. 'What are you doing
LINE 623: there' he cried? 'Have you gone mad with fright? You have heard no
LINE 624: doubt that in such lonely places as this, fox-spirits sometimes try to
LINE 625: cast a spell upon men. But, dear people, you need not fear. I have
LINE 626: come back, and will not let such creatures harm you.' And so saying he
LINE 627: dragged Ukon from the bed. 'Oh, Sir' she said 'I felt so queer and
LINE 628: frightened that I fell flat down upon my face; and what my poor lady
LINE 629: must be going through I dare not think.' 'Then try not to add to her
LINE 630: fright' said Genji, and pushing her aside bent over the prostate
LINE 631: form. The girl was scarcely breathing. He touched her; she was quite
LINE 632: limp. She did not know him.
LINE 633: Perhaps some accursed thing, some demon had tried to snatch her spirit
LINE 634: away; she was so timid, so childishly helpless. The man came with the
LINE 635: candle. Ukon was still too frightened to move. Genji placed a screen
LINE 636: so as to hide the bed and called the man to him. It was of course
LINE 637: contrary to etiquette that he should serve Genji himself and he
LINE 638: hesitated in embarrassment, not venturing even to ascend the dais.
LINE 639: 'Come here' said Genji impatiently; 'use your common-sense.'
LINE 640: Reluctantly the man gave him the light, and as he held it towards the
LINE 641: bed, he saw for a moment the figure which had stood there in his dream
LINE 642: still hovering beside the pillow; suddenly it vanished. He had read in
LINE 643: old tales of such apparitions and of their power, and was in great
LINE 644: alarm. But for the moment he was so full of concern for the lady who
LINE 645: now lay motionless on the bed, that he gave no thought to that
LINE 646: menacing vision, and lying down beside her, began gently to move her
LINE 647: limbs. Already they were growing cold. Her breathing had quite
LINE 648: stopped. What could he do? To whom could he turn for help? He ought to
LINE 649: send for a priest. He tried to control himself, but he was very young,
LINE 650: and seeing her lying there all still and pale, he could contain
LINE 651: himself no longer and crying 'Come back to me, my own darling, come
LINE 652: back to life. Do not look at me so strangely!' he flung his arms about
LINE 653: her. But now she was quite cold. Her face was set in a dull, senseless
LINE 654: stare.
LINE 655: Suddenly Ukon, who had been so busy with her own fears, came to
LINE 656: herself again, and set up the most dismal weeping. He disregarded her.
LINE 657: Something had occurred to him. There was a story of how a certain
LINE 658: minister was waylaid by a demon as he passed through the Southern
LINE 659: Hall. The man, Genji remembered, had been prostrate with fear; but in
LINE 660: the end he revived and escaped. No, she could not really be dead,
LINE 661: and turning to Ukon he said firmly: 'Come now, we cannot have you
LINE 662: making such a hideous noise in the middle of the night.' But he
LINE 663: himself was stunned with grief, and though he gave Ukon distracted
LINE 664: orders scarce knew what he was doing. Presently he sent for the
LINE 665: steward's son and said to him: 'Someone here has had a fright and is
LINE 666: in a very bad way. I want you to go to Koremitsu's house and tell him
LINE 667: to come as quickly as he can. If his brother the priest is there too,
LINE 668: take him aside and tell him quietly that I should like to see him at
LINE 669: once. But do not speak loud enough for the nun their mother to hear;
LINE 670: for I would not have her know of this excursion.' But though he
LINE 671: managed to say the words, his brain was all the while in a hideous
LINE 672: turmoil. For added to the ghastly thought that he himself had caused
LINE 673: her death there was the dread and horror with which the whole place
LINE 674: now inspired him.
LINE 675: It was past midnight. A violent storm began to rise, sighing dismally
LINE 676: as it swept the pine-trees that clustered round the house. And all the
LINE 677: while some strange bird—an owl, he supposed—kept screeching hoarsely.
LINE 678: Utter desolation on all sides. No human voice; no friendly sound. Why,
LINE 679: why had he chosen this hideous place?
LINE 680: Ukon had fainted and was lying by her mistress's side. Was she too
LINE 681: going to die of fright? No, no. He must not give way to such thoughts.
LINE 682: He was now the only person left who was capable of action. Was there
LINE 683: nothing he could do? The candle was burning badly. He lit it again.
LINE 684: Over by the screen in the corner of the main room something was
LINE 685: moving. There it was again, but in another corner now. There was a
LINE 686: sound of footsteps treading cautiously. It still went on. Now they
LINE 687: were coming up behind him....
LINE 688: If only Koremitsu would return! But Koremitsu was a rover and a long
LINE 689: time was wasted in looking for him. Would it never be day? It seemed
LINE 690: to him that this night was lasting a thousand years. But now,
LINE 691: somewhere a long way off, a cock crowed.
LINE 692: Why had fate seen fit to treat him thus? He felt that it must be as a
LINE 693: punishment for all the strange and forbidden amours into which in
LINE 694: these last years he had despite himself been drawn, that now this
LINE 695: unheard of horror had befallen him. And such things, though one may
LINE 696: keep them secret for a time, always come out in the end. He minded
LINE 697: most that the Emperor would be certain to discover sooner or later
LINE 698: about this and all his other affairs. Then there was the general
LINE 699: scandal. Everyone would know. The very gutter boys would make merry
LINE 700: over him. Never, never must he do such things again, or his reputation
LINE 701: would utterly collapse....
LINE 702: At last Koremitsu arrived. He prided himself on being always ready to
LINE 703: carry out his master's wishes immediately at whatever hour of the
LINE 704: night or day, and he thought it very provoking of Genji to have sent
LINE 705: for him just on the one occasion when he was not to hand. And now that
LINE 706: he had come his master did not seem able to give him any orders, but
LINE 707: stood speechless in front of him.
LINE 708: Ukon, hearing Koremitsu's voice, suddenly came to herself and
LINE 709: remembering what had happened, burst into tears. And now Genji, who
LINE 710: while he alone was there had supported and encouraged the weeping
LINE 711: maid-servant, relieved at last by Koremitsu could contain himself no
LINE 712: longer, and suddenly realizing again the terrible thing that had
LINE 713: befallen him he burst into uncontrollable weeping. 'Something horrible
LINE 714: has happened here,' he managed to say at last, 'too dreadful to
LINE 715: explain. I have heard that when such things as this suddenly befall,
LINE 716: certain scriptures should be read. I would have this done, and prayers
LINE 717: said. That is why I asked you to bring your brother....'
LINE 718: 'He went up to the mountain yesterday' said Koremitsu. 'But I see
LINE 719: that there has been terrible work here afoot. Was it in some sudden
LINE 720: fit of madness that you did this thing?' Genji shook his head. So
LINE 721: moved was Koremitsu at the sight of his master weeping, that he too
LINE 722: began to sob. Had he been an older man, versed in the ways of the
LINE 723: world, he might have been of some use in such a crisis, but both of
LINE 724: them were young and both were equally perplexed. At last Koremitsu
LINE 725: said: 'One thing at least is clear. The steward's son must not know.
LINE 726: For though he himself can be depended upon, he is the sort of person
LINE 727: who is sure to tell all his relatives, and they might meddle
LINE 728: disastrously in the affair. We had best get clear of this house as
LINE 729: quietly as we can.' 'Perhaps' said Genji; 'but it would be hard to
LINE 730: find a less frequented place than this.' 'At any rate' Koremitsu
LINE 731: continued, 'we cannot take her to her own house; for there her
LINE 732: gentlewomen, who loved her dearly, would raise such a weeping and
LINE 733: wailing as would soon bring a pack of neighbours swarming around, and
LINE 734: all would quickly be known. If only I knew of some mountain-temple—for
LINE 735: there such things are customary[14] and pass almost unnoticed.' He
LINE 736: paused and reflected. 'There is a lady I once knew who has become a
LINE 737: nun and now lives on the Higashi Yama. She was my father's wet-nurse
LINE 738: and is now very old and bent. She does not of course live alone; but
LINE 739: no outside people come there.' A faint light was already showing in
LINE 740: the sky when Koremitsu brought the carriage in. Thinking that Genji
LINE 741: would not wish to move the body himself, he wrapt it in a rush-mat and
LINE 742: carried it towards the carriage. How small she was to hold! Her face
LINE 743: was calm and beautiful. He felt no repulsion. He could find no way to
LINE 744: secure her hair, and when he began to carry her it overflowed and
LINE 745: hung towards the ground. Genji saw, and his eyes darkened. A hideous
LINE 746: anguish possessed him.
LINE 747: He tried to follow the body, but Koremitsu dissuaded him, saying 'You
LINE 748: must ride back to your palace as quickly as you can; you have just
LINE 749: time to get there before the stir begins,' and putting Ukon into the
LINE 750: carriage, he gave Genji his horse. Then pulling up his silk trousers
LINE 751: to the knee, he accompanied the carriage on foot. It was a very
LINE 752: singular procession; but Koremitsu, seeing his master's terrible
LINE 753: distress, forgot for the moment his own dignity and walked stolidly
LINE 754: on. Genji, hardly conscious of what went on around him arrived at last
LINE 755: in ghostly pallor at his house. 'Where do you come from, my Lord?'
LINE 756: 'How ill you look.' ... Questions assailed him, but he hurried to his
LINE 757: room and lay behind his curtain. He tried to calm himself, but hideous
LINE 758: thoughts tormented him. Why had he not insisted upon going with her?
LINE 759: What if after all she were not dead and waking up should find that he
LINE 760: had thus abandoned her? While these wild thoughts chased through his
LINE 761: brain a terrible sensation of choking began to torment him. His head
LINE 762: ached, his body seemed to be on fire. Indeed he felt so strange that
LINE 763: he thought he too was about to die suddenly and inexplicably as she
LINE 764: had done. The sun was now high, but he did not get up. His gentlemen,
LINE 765: with murmurs of astonishment, tried every means to rouse him. He sent
LINE 766: away the dainties they brought, and lay hour after hour plunged in the
LINE 767: darkest thoughts. A messenger arrived from the Emperor: 'His Majesty
LINE 768: has been uneasy since yesterday when his envoys sought everywhere for
LINE 769: your Highness in vain.'
LINE 770: The young lords too came from the Great Hall. He would see none of
LINE 771: them but Tō no Chūjō, and even him he made stand outside his curtain
LINE 772: while he spoke to him: 'My foster-mother has been very ill since the
LINE 773: fifth month. She shaved her head and performed other penances, in
LINE 774: consequence of which (or so it seems) she recovered a little and
LINE 775: got up, but is very much enfeebled. She sent word that she desired to
LINE 776: see me once more before she died, and as I was very fond of her when I
LINE 777: was a child, I could not refuse. While I was there a servant in the
LINE 778: house fell ill and died quite suddenly. Out of consideration for me
LINE 779: they removed the body at nightfall. But as soon as I was told of what
LINE 780: had happened I remembered that the Fast of the Ninth Month was at hand
LINE 781: and for this reason I have not thought it right to present myself to
LINE 782: the Emperor my father. Moreover, since early morning I have had a
LINE 783: cough and very bad headache, so you will forgive me for treating you
LINE 784: in this way.'
LINE 785: 'I will give the Emperor your message. But I must tell you that last
LINE 786: night when you were out he sent messengers to look for you and seemed,
LINE 787: if I may venture to say so, to be in a very ill humour.' Tō no Chūjō
LINE 788: turned to go, but pausing a moment came back to Genji's couch and said
LINE 789: quietly: 'What really happened to you last night? What you told me
LINE 790: just now cannot possibly be true.' 'You need not go into details,'
LINE 791: answered Genji impatiently. 'Simply tell him that unintentionally I
LINE 792: became exposed to a pollution, and apologize to him for me as best you
LINE 793: can.' He spoke sharply, but in his heart there was only an unspeakable
LINE 794: sadness; and he was very tired.
LINE 795: All day he lay hidden from sight. Once he sent for Tō no Chūjō's
LINE 796: brother Kurōdo no Ben and gave him a formal message for the Emperor.
LINE 797: The same excuse would serve for the Great Hall, and he sent a similar
LINE 798: message there and to other houses where he might be expected.
LINE 799: At dusk Koremitsu came. The story of Genji's pollution had turned all
LINE 800: visitors from the door, and Koremitsu found his palace utterly
LINE 801: deserted. 'What happened?' said Genji, summoning him, 'you are sure
LINE 802: that she is dead?' and holding his sleeve before his face he wept.
LINE 803: 'All is over; of that there is no doubt,' said Koremitsu, also in
LINE 804: tears; 'and since it is not possible for them to keep the body long, I
LINE 805: have arranged with a very respectable aged priest who is my friend
LINE 806: that the ceremony shall take place to-morrow, since to-morrow chances
LINE 807: to be a good calendar day.' 'And what of her gentlewoman?' asked
LINE 808: Genji. 'I fear she will not live,' said Koremitsu. 'She cries out that
LINE 809: she must follow her mistress and this morning, had I not held her, she
LINE 810: would have cast herself from a high rock. She threatened to tell the
LINE 811: servants at my lady's house, but I prevailed upon her to think the
LINE 812: matter over quietly before she did this.' 'Poor thing,' said Genji,
LINE 813: 'small wonder that she should be thus distracted. I too am feeling
LINE 814: strangely disordered and do not know what will become of me.' 'Torment
LINE 815: yourself no more,' said Koremitsu. 'All things happen as they must.
LINE 816: Here is one who will handle this matter very prudently for you, and
LINE 817: none shall be the wiser.' 'Happen as they must. You are right' said
LINE 818: Genji 'and so I try to persuade myself. But in the pursuit of one's
LINE 819: own wanton pleasures to have done harm and to have caused someone's
LINE 820: death—that is a hideous crime; a terrible load of sin to bear with me
LINE 821: through the world. Do not tell even your sister; much less your mother
LINE 822: the nun, for I am ashamed that she should even know I have ever done
LINE 823: that kind of thing.'[15] 'Do not fear' answered Koremitsu. 'Even to
LINE 824: the priests, who must to a certain extent be let into the secret, I
LINE 825: have told a long made-up tale' and Genji felt a little easier in his
LINE 826: mind.
LINE 827: The waiting-women of his palace were sorely puzzled; 'First he says he
LINE 828: has been defiled and cannot go to Court, and now he sits whispering
LINE 829: and sighing.' What could it all mean? 'Again I beg you' said Genji at
LINE 830: last 'to see that everything is done as it should be.' He was thinking
LINE 831: all the time of the elaborate Court funerals which he had
LINE 832: witnessed (he had, indeed, seen no others) and imagined Koremitsu
LINE 833: directing a complicated succession of rituals. 'I will do what I can;
LINE 834: it will be no such great matter,' he answered and turned to go.
LINE 835: Suddenly Genji could bear no longer the thought that he should never
LINE 836: see her again. 'You will think it very foolish of me,' he said, 'but I
LINE 837: am coming with you. I shall ride on horseback.' 'If your heart is set
LINE 838: upon it,' said Koremitsu, 'it is not for me to reason with you. Let us
LINE 839: start soon, so that we may be back before the night is over.' So
LINE 840: putting on the hunting-dress and other garments in which he had
LINE 841: disguised himself before, he left his room.
LINE 842: Already the most hideous anguish possessed him, and now, as he set out
LINE 843: upon this strange journey, to the dark thoughts that filled his mind
LINE 844: was added a dread lest his visit might rouse to some fresh fury the
LINE 845: mysterious power which had destroyed her. Should he go? He hesitated;
LINE 846: but though he knew that this way lay no cure for his sadness, yet if
LINE 847: he did not see her now, never again perhaps in any life to come would
LINE 848: he meet the face and form that he had loved so well. So with Koremitsu
LINE 849: and the one same groom to bear him company he set out upon the road.
LINE 850: The way seemed endless. The moon of the seventeenth night had risen
LINE 851: and lit up the whole space of the Kamo plain, and in the light of the
LINE 852: outrunners' torches the countryside towards Toribeno now came dimly
LINE 853: into sight. But Genji in his sickness and despair saw none of this,
LINE 854: and suddenly waking from the stupor into which he had fallen found
LINE 855: that they had arrived.
LINE 856: The nun's cell was in a chapel built against the wall of a wooden
LINE 857: house. It was a desolate spot, but the chapel itself was very
LINE 858: beautiful. The light of the visitors' torches flickered through the
LINE 859: open door. In the inner room there was no sound but that of a
LINE 860: woman weeping by herself; in the outer room were several priests
LINE 861: talking together (or was it praying?) in hushed voices. In the
LINE 862: neighbouring temples vespers were over and there was absolute
LINE 863: stillness; only towards the Kiyomizu were lights visible and many
LINE 864: figures seemed to throng the hill-side.[16]
LINE 865: A senior priest, son of the aged nun, now began to recite the
LINE 866: Scriptures in an impressive voice, and Genji as he listened felt the
LINE 867: tears come into his eyes. He went in. Ukon was lying behind a screen;
LINE 868: when she heard him enter, she turned the lamp to the wall. What
LINE 869: terrible thing was she trying to hide from him? But when he came
LINE 870: nearer he saw to his joy that the dead lady was not changed in any way
LINE 871: whatsoever, but lay there very calm and beautiful; and feeling no
LINE 872: horror or fear at all he took her hand and said, 'Speak to me once
LINE 873: again; tell me why for so short a while you came to me and filled my
LINE 874: heart with gladness, and then so soon forsook me, who loved you so
LINE 875: well?' and he wept long and bitterly by her side.
LINE 876: The priests did not know who he was, but they were touched by his
LINE 877: evident misery and themselves shed tears. He asked Ukon to come back
LINE 878: with him, but she answered: 'I have served this lady since she was a
LINE 879: little child and never once for so much as an hour have I left her.
LINE 880: How can I suddenly part from one who was so dear to me and serve in
LINE 881: another's house? And I must now go and tell her people what has become
LINE 882: of her; for (such is the manner of her death) if I do not speak soon,
LINE 883: there will be an outcry that it was I who was to blame, and that would
LINE 884: be a terrible thing for me, Sir,' and she burst into tears, wailing 'I
LINE 885: will lie with her upon the pyre; my smoke shall mingle with hers!'
LINE 886: 'Poor soul' said Genji, 'I do not wonder at your despair. But
LINE 887: this is the way of the world. Late or soon we must all go where she
LINE 888: has gone. Take comfort and trust in me.' So he sought to console her,
LINE 889: but in a moment he added: 'Those, I know, are but hollow words. I too
LINE 890: care no longer for life and would gladly follow her.' So he spoke,
LINE 891: giving her in the end but little comfort.
LINE 892: 'The night is far spent' said Koremitsu; 'we must now be on our way.'
LINE 893: And so with many backward looks and a heart full to bursting he left
LINE 894: the house. A heavy dew had fallen and the mist was so thick that it
LINE 895: was hard to see the road. On the way it occurred to him that she was
LINE 896: still wearing his scarlet cloak, which he had lent her when they lay
LINE 897: down together on the last evening. How closely their lives had been
LINE 898: entwined!
LINE 899: Noting that he sat very unsteadily in his saddle, Koremitsu walked
LINE 900: beside him and gave him a hand. But when they came to a dyke, he lost
LINE 901: hold and his master fell to the ground. Here he lay in great pain and
LINE 902: bewilderment. 'I shall not live to finish the journey' he said; 'I
LINE 903: have not strength to go so far.' Koremitsu too was sorely troubled,
LINE 904: for he felt that despite all Genji's insistence, he ought never to
LINE 905: have allowed him, fever-stricken as he was, to embark upon this
LINE 906: disastrous journey. In great agitation he plunged his hands in the
LINE 907: river and prayed to Our Lady Kwannon of Kiyomizu. Genji too roused
LINE 908: himself at last and forced himself to pray inwardly to the Buddha. And
LINE 909: so they managed to start upon their journey again and in the end with
LINE 910: Koremitsu's help he reached his palace.
LINE 911: This sudden journey undertaken so late at night had seemed to all his
LINE 912: household the height of imprudence. They had noted for some while past
LINE 913: his nightly wanderings grow more and more frequent; but though often
LINE 914: agitated and pre-occupied, never had he returned so haggard as that
LINE 915: morning. What could be the object of these continual excursions?
LINE 916: And they shook their heads in great concern. Genji flung himself upon
LINE 917: his bed and lay there in fever and pain for several days. He was
LINE 918: growing very weak. The news was brought to the Emperor who was greatly
LINE 919: distressed and ordered continual prayers to be said for him in all the
LINE 920: great temples; and indeed there were more special services and
LINE 921: purification-ceremonies and incantations than I have room to rehearse.
LINE 922: When it became known that this prince so famous for his great charm
LINE 923: and beauty, was likely soon to die, there was a great stir in all the
LINE 924: kingdom.
LINE 925: Sick though he was he did not forget to send for Ukon and have her
LINE 926: enrolled among his gentlewomen. Koremitsu, who was beside himself with
LINE 927: anxiety concerning his master, yet managed on her arrival to calm
LINE 928: himself and give to Ukon friendly instruction in her new duties; for
LINE 929: he was touched by the helpless plight in which she had been left. And
LINE 930: Genji, whenever he felt a little better, would use her to carry
LINE 931: messages and letters, so that she soon grew used to waiting upon him.
LINE 932: She was dressed in deep black and though not at all handsome was a
LINE 933: pleasant enough looking woman.
LINE 934: 'It seems that the same fate which so early stayed your lady's course
LINE 935: has willed that I too should be but little longer for this world. I
LINE 936: know in what sore distress you are left by the loss of one who was for
LINE 937: so many years your mistress and friend; and it was my purpose to have
LINE 938: comforted you in your bereavement by every care and kindness I could
LINE 939: devise. For this reason, indeed, it grieves me that I shall survive
LINE 940: her for so short a time.' So, somewhat stiltedly, he whispered to
LINE 941: Ukon, and being now very weak he could not refrain from tears. Apart
LINE 942: from the fact that his death would leave her utterly without resource,
LINE 943: she had now quite taken to him and would have been very sorry indeed
LINE 944: if he had died.
LINE 945: His gentlemen ran hither and thither, distracted; the Emperor's envoys
LINE 946: thronged thick as the feet of the raindrops. Hearing of his
LINE 947: father's distress and anxiety, Genji strove hard to reassure him by
LINE 948: pretending to some slight respite or improvement. His father-in-law
LINE 949: too showed great concern, calling every day for news and ordering the
LINE 950: performance of various rites and potent liturgies; and it was perhaps
LINE 951: as a result of this, that having been dangerously ill for more than
LINE 952: twenty days, he took a turn for the better, and soon all his symptoms
LINE 953: began to disappear. On the night of his recovery the term of his
LINE 954: defilement also ended and hearing that the Emperor was still extremely
LINE 955: uneasy about him, he determined to reassure the Court by returning to
LINE 956: his official residence at the Palace. His father-in-law came to fetch
LINE 957: him in his own carriage and rather irritatingly urged upon him all
LINE 958: sorts of remedies and precautions.
LINE 959: For some while everything in the world to which he had now returned
LINE 960: seemed strange to him and he indeed scarce knew himself; but by the
LINE 961: twentieth day of the ninth month his recovery was complete, nor did
LINE 962: the pallor and thinness of his face become him by any means ill.
LINE 963: At times he would stare vacantly before him and burst into loud
LINE 964: weeping, and seeing this there were not wanting those who said that he
LINE 965: was surely possessed.
LINE 966: Often he would send for Ukon, and once when they had been talking in
LINE 967: the still of the evening he said to her 'There is one thing which
LINE 968: still puzzles me. Why would she never tell me who she was? For even if
LINE 969: she was indeed, as she once said, "a fisherman's child," it was a
LINE 970: strange perversity to use such reticence with one who loved her so
LINE 971: well.'
LINE 972: 'You ask why she hid her name from you?' said Ukon. 'Can you wonder at
LINE 973: it? When could she have been expected to tell you her name (not that
LINE 974: it would have meant much to you if you had heard it)? For from the
LINE 975: beginning you treated her with a strange mistrust, coming with such
LINE 976: secrecy and mystery as might well make her doubt whether you were
LINE 977: indeed a creature of the waking world. But though you never told her
LINE 978: she knew well enough who you were, and the thought that you would not
LINE 979: be thus secret had you regarded her as more than a mere plaything or
LINE 980: idle distraction was very painful to her.'
LINE 981: 'What a wretched series of misunderstandings' said Genji. 'For my part
LINE 982: I had no mind to put a distance between us. But I had no experience in
LINE 983: such affairs as this. There are many difficulties in the path of such
LINE 984: people as I. First and foremost I feared the anger of my father the
LINE 985: Emperor; and then, the foolish jesting of the world. I felt myself
LINE 986: hedged in by courtly rules and restrictions. But for all the tiresome
LINE 987: concealments that my rank forced upon me, from that first evening I
LINE 988: had so strangely set my heart upon her that though reason counselled
LINE 989: me I could not hold back; and indeed it seems sometimes to me that an
LINE 990: irresistible fate drove me to do the thing of which I now so bitterly
LINE 991: and continually repent. But tell me more about her. For there can now
LINE 992: be no reason for concealment. When on each seventh day I cause the
LINE 993: names of the Buddhas to be written for her comfort and salvation, whom
LINE 994: am I to name in my inward prayer?'
LINE 995: 'There can be no harm in my telling you that' said Ukon, 'and I should
LINE 996: have done so before, did I not somehow feel it a shame to be prating
LINE 997: to you now about things she would not have me speak of while she was
LINE 998: alive. Her parents died when she was quite small. Her father, Sammi
LINE 999: Chūjō, loved her very dearly, but felt always that he could not give
LINE 1000: her all the advantages to which her great beauty entitled her; and
LINE 1001: still perplexed about her future and how best to do his duty by her,
LINE 1002: he died. Soon afterwards some accident brought her into the company of
LINE 1003: Tō no Chūjō[17] who was at that time still a lieutenant and for three
LINE 1004: years he made her very happy. But in the autumn of last year
LINE 1005: disquieting letters began to arrive from the Great Hall of the
LINE 1006: Right,[18] and being by nature prone to fits of unreasoning fear she
LINE 1007: now fell into a wild panic and fled to the western part of the town
LINE 1008: where she hid herself in the house of her old wet-nurse. Here she was
LINE 1009: very uncomfortable, and had planned to move to a certain village in
LINE 1010: the hills, when she discovered that it would be unlucky, owing to the
LINE 1011: position of the stars since the beginning of the year, to make a
LINE 1012: journey in that direction; and (though she never told me so) I think,
LINE 1013: Sir, it troubled her sorely that you should have come upon her when
LINE 1014: she was living in so wretched a place. But there was never anyone in
LINE 1015: the world like my lady for keeping things to herself; she could never
LINE 1016: bear that other people should know what was on her mind. I have no
LINE 1017: doubt, Sir, that she sometimes behaved very oddly to you and that you
LINE 1018: have seen all this for yourself.'
LINE 1019: Yes, this was all just as Tō no Chūjō had described. 'I think there
LINE 1020: was some mention of a child that Chūjō was vexed to have lost sight
LINE 1021: of' said Genji more interested than ever; 'am I right?' 'Yes, indeed,'
LINE 1022: she answered 'it was born in the spring of last year, a girl, and a
LINE 1023: fine child it was.' 'Where is it now?' asked Genji. 'Could you get
LINE 1024: hold of it and bring it to me here without letting anyone know where
LINE 1025: you were taking it? It would be a great comfort to me in my present
LINE 1026: misery to have some remembrance of her near me;' and he added, 'I
LINE 1027: ought of course to tell Chūjō, but that would lead to useless and
LINE 1028: painful discussions about what has happened. Somehow or other I will
LINE 1029: manage to bring her up here in my palace. I think there can be no harm
LINE 1030: in that. And you will easily enough find some story to tell to
LINE 1031: whatever people are now looking after her.' 'I am very glad that
LINE 1032: this has entered your head,' said Ukon, 'it would be a poor look-out
LINE 1033: for her to grow up in the quarter where she is now living. With no one
LINE 1034: properly belonging to her and in such a part of the town....'
LINE 1035: In the stillness of the evening, under a sky of exquisite beauty, here
LINE 1036: and there along the borders in front of his palace some insect croaked
LINE 1037: its song; the leaves were just beginning to turn. And as he looked
LINE 1038: upon this pleasant picture he felt ashamed at the contrast between his
LINE 1039: surroundings and the little house where Yūgao had lived. Suddenly
LINE 1040: somewhere among the bamboo groves the bird called iyebato uttered its
LINE 1041: sharp note. He remembered just how she had looked when in the gardens
LINE 1042: of that fatal house the same bird had startled her by its cry, and
LINE 1043: turning to Ukon, 'How old was she?' he suddenly asked; 'for though she
LINE 1044: seemed childlike in her diffidence and helplessness, that may only
LINE 1045: have been a sign that she was not long for this world.' 'She must have
LINE 1046: been nineteen' said Ukon. 'When my mother, who was her first
LINE 1047: wet-nurse, died and left me an orphan, my lady's father was pleased to
LINE 1048: notice me and reared me at my lady's side. Ah Sir, when I think of it,
LINE 1049: I do not know how I shall live without her; for kind as people here
LINE 1050: may be I do not seem to get used to them. I suppose it is that I knew
LINE 1051: her ways, poor lady, she having been my mistress for so many years.'
LINE 1052: To Genji even the din of the cloth-beaters' mallets had become dear
LINE 1053: through recollection, and as he lay in bed he repeated those verses of
LINE 1054: Po Chü-i.
LINE 1055: _In the eighth month and ninth month when the nights are growing long
LINE 1056: A thousand times, ten thousand times the fuller's stick beats._
LINE 1057: The young brother still waited upon him, but he no longer brought with
LINE 1058: him the letters which he had been used to bring. Utsusemi thought he
LINE 1059: had at last decided that her treatment of him was too unfriendly to be
LINE 1060: borne, and was vexed that he should feel so. Then suddenly she
LINE 1061: heard of his illness, and all her vexation turned to consternation and
LINE 1062: anxiety. She was soon to set out upon her long journey, but this did
LINE 1063: not much interest her; and to see whether Genji had quite forgotten
LINE 1064: her she sent him a message saying that she had been able to find no
LINE 1065: words in which to express her grief at hearing the news of his
LINE 1066: illness. With it she sent the poem: 'I did not ask for news and you
LINE 1067: did not ask why I was silent; so the days wore on and I remained in
LINE 1068: sorrow and dismay.' He had not forgotten her, no, not in all his
LINE 1069: trouble; and his answer came: 'Of this life, fragile as the
LINE 1070: utsusemi's[19] shell, already I was weary, when your word came, and
LINE 1071: gave me strength to live anew.' The poem was written in a very
LINE 1072: tremulous and confused hand; but she thought the writing very
LINE 1073: beautiful and it delighted her that he had not forgotten how,
LINE 1074: cicada-like, she had shed her scarf. There could be no harm in this
LINE 1075: interchange of notes, but she had no intention of arranging a meeting.
LINE 1076: She thought that at last even he had seen that there could be no sense
LINE 1077: in that.
LINE 1078: As for Utsusemi's companion, she was not yet married, and Genji heard
LINE 1079: that she had become the mistress of Tō no Chūjō's brother Kurōdo no
LINE 1080: Shōshō; and though he feared that Shōshō might already have taken very
LINE 1081: ill the discovery that he was not first in the field, and did not at
LINE 1082: all wish to offend him, yet he had a certain curiosity about the girl
LINE 1083: and sent Utsusemi's little brother with a message asking if she had
LINE 1084: heard of his illness and the poem: 'Had I not once gathered for my
LINE 1085: pillow a handful of the sedge that grows upon the eaves,[20] not a
LINE 1086: dewdrop of pretext could my present message find.' It was an acrostic
LINE 1087: with many hidden meanings. He tied the letter to a tall reed and
LINE 1088: bade him deliver it secretly; but was afterwards very uneasy at the
LINE 1089: thought that it might go astray. 'If it falls into Shōshō's hands' he
LINE 1090: thought 'he will at once guess that it was I who was before him.' But
LINE 1091: after all Shōshō would probably not take that so very hard, Genji had
LINE 1092: vanity enough to think.
LINE 1093: The boy delivered the message when Shōshō was at a safe distance. She
LINE 1094: could not help feeling a little hurt; but it was something that he had
LINE 1095: remembered her at all, and justifying it to herself with the excuse
LINE 1096: that she had had no time to do anything better, she sent the boy
LINE 1097: straight back with the verse: 'The faint wind of your favour, that but
LINE 1098: for a moment blew, with grief has part befrosted the small sedge of
LINE 1099: the eaves.' It was very ill-written, with all sorts of ornamental but
LINE 1100: misleading strokes and flourishes; indeed with a complete lack of
LINE 1101: style. However, it served to remind him of the face he had first seen
LINE 1102: that evening by the lamplight. As for the other who on that occasion
LINE 1103: had sat so stiffly facing her, what determination there had been in
LINE 1104: her face, what a steady resolution to give no quarter!
LINE 1105: The affair with the lady of the sedge was so unintentional and so
LINE 1106: insignificant that though he regarded it as rather frivolous and
LINE 1107: indiscreet, he saw no great harm in it. But if he did not take himself
LINE 1108: in hand before it was too late he would soon again be involved in some
LINE 1109: entanglement which might finally ruin his reputation.
LINE 1110: On the forty-ninth day after Yūgao's death a service in her memory was
LINE 1111: by his orders secretly held in the Hokedō on Mount Hiyei. The ritual
LINE 1112: performed was of the most elaborate kind, everything that was required
LINE 1113: being supplied from the Prince's own store; and even the decoration of
LINE 1114: the service books and images was carried out with the utmost
LINE 1115: attention. Koremitsu's brother, a man of great piety, was
LINE 1116: entrusted with the direction of the ceremony, and all went well. Next
LINE 1117: Genji sent for his old writing-master, a doctor of letters for whom he
LINE 1118: had a great liking and bade him write the prayer for the dead.[21]
LINE 1119: 'Say that I commit to Amida the Buddha one not named whom I loved, but
LINE 1120: lost disastrously,' and he wrote out a rough draft for the learned man
LINE 1121: to amend. 'There is nothing to add or alter,' said the master, deeply
LINE 1122: moved. Who could it be, he wondered, at whose death the prince was so
LINE 1123: distressed? (For Genji, try as he might, could not hide his tears.)
LINE 1124: When he was secretly looking through his store for largesse to give to
LINE 1125: the Hokedō priests, he came upon a certain dress and as he folded it
LINE 1126: made the poem: 'The girdle that to-day with tears I knot, shall we
LINE 1127: ever in some new life untie?'
LINE 1128: Till now her spirit had wandered in the void.[22]
LINE 1129: But already she must be setting out on her new life-path, and in great
LINE 1130: solicitude, he prayed continually for her safety.
LINE 1131: He met Tō no Chūjō and his heart beat violently, for he had longed to
LINE 1132: tell him about Yūgao's child and how it was to be reared. But he
LINE 1133: feared that the rest of the story would needlessly anger and distress
LINE 1134: him, and he did not mention the matter. Meanwhile the servants of
LINE 1135: Yūgao's house were surprised that they had had no news from her nor
LINE 1136: even from Ukon, and had begun to be seriously disquieted. They had
LINE 1137: still no proof that it was Genji who was her lover, but several of
LINE 1138: them thought that they had recognized him and his name was whispered
LINE 1139: among them. They would have it that Koremitsu knew the secret, but he
LINE 1140: pretended to know nothing whatever about Yūgao's lover and found a
LINE 1141: way to put off all their questions; and as he was still frequenting
LINE 1142: the house for his own purposes, it was easy for them to believe that
LINE 1143: he was not really concerned in their mistress's affairs. Perhaps after
LINE 1144: all it was some blackguard of a Zuryō's son who, frightened of Tō no
LINE 1145: Chūjō's interference, had carried her off to his province. The real
LINE 1146: owner of the house was a daughter of Yūgao's second wet-nurse, who had
LINE 1147: three children of her own. Ukon had been brought up with them, but
LINE 1148: they thought that it was perhaps because she was not their own sister
LINE 1149: that Ukon sent them no news of their mistress, and they were in great
LINE 1150: distress.
LINE 1151: Ukon who knew that they would assail her with questions which her
LINE 1152: promise to Genji forbade her to answer, dared not go to the house, not
LINE 1153: even to get news of her lady's child. It had been put out somewhere to
LINE 1154: nurse, but to her great sorrow she had quite lost sight of it.
LINE 1155: Longing all the while to see her face once more though only in a
LINE 1156: dream, upon the night after the ceremony on Mount Hiyei, he had a
LINE 1157: vision very different from that for which he prayed. There appeared to
LINE 1158: him once more, just as on that fatal night, the figure of a woman in
LINE 1159: menacing posture, and he was dismayed at the thought that some demon
LINE 1160: which haunted the desolate spot might on the occasion when it did that
LINE 1161: terrible thing, also have entered into him and possessed him.
LINE 1162: Iyo no Suke was to start early in the Godless Month and had announced
LINE 1163: that his wife would go with him. Genji sent very handsome parting
LINE 1164: presents and among them with special intent he put many very exquisite
LINE 1165: combs and fans. With them were silk strips to offer to the God of
LINE 1166: Journeys and, above all, the scarf which she had dropped, and, tied to
LINE 1167: it, a poem in which he said that he had kept it in remembrance of her
LINE 1168: while there was still hope of their meeting, but now returned it wet
LINE 1169: with tears shed in vain. There was a long letter with the poem,
LINE 1170: but this was of no particular interest and is here omitted. She sent
LINE 1171: no answer by the man who had brought the presents, but gave her
LINE 1172: brother the poem: 'That to the changed cicada you should return her
LINE 1173: summer dress shows that you too have changed and fills an insect heart
LINE 1174: with woe.'
LINE 1175: He thought long about her. Though she had with so strange and
LINE 1176: inexplicable a resolution steeled her heart against him to the end,
LINE 1177: yet each time he remembered that she had gone forever it filled him
LINE 1178: with depression.
LINE 1179: It was the first day of the tenth month, and as though in sign that
LINE 1180: winter had indeed begun heavy rain fell. All day long Genji watched
LINE 1181: the stormy sky. Autumn had hideously bereaved him and winter already
LINE 1182: was taking from him one whom he dearly loved:
LINE 1183: Now like a traveller who has tried two ways in vain
LINE 1184: I stand perplexed where these sad seasons meet.
LINE 1185: Now at least we must suppose he was convinced that such secret
LINE 1186: adventures led only to misery.
LINE 1187: I should indeed be very loth to recount in all their detail matters
LINE 1188: which he took so much trouble to conceal, did I not know that if you
LINE 1189: found I had omitted anything you would at once ask why, just because
LINE 1190: he was supposed to be an Emperor's son, I must needs put a favourable
LINE 1191: showing on his conduct by leaving out all his indiscretions; and you
LINE 1192: would soon be saying that this was no history but a mere made-up tale
LINE 1193: designed to influence the judgment of posterity. As it is I shall be
LINE 1194: called a scandal-monger; but that I cannot help.
LINE 1195: [1] Lady Rokujō. Who she was gradually becomes apparent in the course
LINE 1196: of the story.

LINE 1208: practice usual with illicit lovers in mediæval Japan.

LINE 1210: [12] Lady Rokujō.

LINE 1220: that the lady is generally known.
LINE 1221: [21] _Gwammon_.
LINE 1222: [22] For forty-nine days the spirit of the dead leads the intermediate
LINE 1223: existence so strangely described in the _Abhidharma Kośa Śāstra_; then
LINE 1224: it begins its new incarnation.
