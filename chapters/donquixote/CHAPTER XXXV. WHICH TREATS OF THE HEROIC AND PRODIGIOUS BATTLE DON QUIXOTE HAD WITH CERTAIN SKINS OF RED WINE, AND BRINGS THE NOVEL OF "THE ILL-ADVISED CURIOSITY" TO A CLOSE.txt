LINE 1: There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho
LINE 2: Panza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote
LINE 3: was lying, shouting, "Run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in
LINE 4: the thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By
LINE 5: the living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the
LINE 6: Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off
LINE 7: as if it were a turnip."
LINE 8: "What are you talking about, brother?" said the curate, pausing as he
LINE 9: was about to read the remainder of the novel. "Are you in your senses,
LINE 10: Sancho? How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two
LINE 11: thousand leagues away?"
LINE 12: Here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting
LINE 13: out, "Stand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy
LINE 14: scimitar shall not avail thee!" And then it seemed as though he were
LINE 15: slashing vigorously at the wall.
LINE 16: "Don't stop to listen," said Sancho, "but go in and part them or help
LINE 17: my master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant
LINE 18: is dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life;
LINE 19: for I saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and
LINE 20: fallen on one side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin."
LINE 21: "May I die," said the landlord at this, "if Don Quixote or Don Devil
LINE 22: has not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at
LINE 23: his bed's head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes
LINE 24: for blood;" and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him,
LINE 25: and there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world.
LINE 26: He was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his
LINE 27: thighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were
LINE 28: very long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his
LINE 29: head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round
LINE 30: his left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for
LINE 31: reasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he
LINE 32: held his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all
LINE 33: sides, uttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting some
LINE 34: giant: and the best of it was his eyes were not open, for he was fast
LINE 35: asleep, and dreaming that he was doing battle with the giant. For his
LINE 36: imagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to
LINE 37: accomplish, that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdom
LINE 38: of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believing
LINE 39: he was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to the
LINE 40: skins that the whole room was full of wine. On seeing this the landlord
LINE 41: was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist
LINE 42: began to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had
LINE 43: not dragged him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to an
LINE 44: end. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber
LINE 45: brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one
LINE 46: dash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not so
LINE 47: completely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing how
LINE 48: short and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle
LINE 49: between her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searching
LINE 50: all over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he
LINE 51: said, "I see now that it's all enchantment in this house; for the last
LINE 52: time, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps
LINE 53: without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and
LINE 54: now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off
LINE 55: with my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from a
LINE 56: fountain."
LINE 57: "What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his
LINE 58: saints?" said the landlord. "Don't you see, you thief, that the blood
LINE 59: and the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and
LINE 60: the red wine swimming all over the room?—and I wish I saw the soul of
LINE 61: him that stabbed them swimming in hell."
LINE 62: "I know nothing about that," said Sancho; "all I know is it will be my
LINE 63: bad luck that through not finding this head my county will melt away
LINE 64: like salt in water;"—for Sancho awake was worse than his master asleep,
LINE 65: so much had his master's promises addled his wits.
LINE 66: The landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and the
LINE 67: mischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the
LINE 68: last time when they went without paying; and that their privileges of
LINE 69: chivalry should not hold good this time to let one or other of them off
LINE 70: without paying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put
LINE 71: to the damaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote's hands,
LINE 72: who, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of
LINE 73: the Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, "Exalted and
LINE 74: beauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of
LINE 75: any harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am
LINE 76: released from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high
LINE 77: and by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled
LINE 78: it so successfully."
LINE 79: "Did not I say so?" said Sancho on hearing this. "You see I wasn't
LINE 80: drunk; there you see my master has already salted the giant; there's no
LINE 81: doubt about the bulls; my county is all right!"
LINE 82: Who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master
LINE 83: and man? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed
LINE 84: himself; but at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived
LINE 85: with no small trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep
LINE 86: with every appearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep,
LINE 87: and came out to the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not
LINE 88: having found the head of the giant; but much more work had they to
LINE 89: appease the landlord, who was furious at the sudden death of his
LINE 90: wine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half crying, "At an
LINE 91: evil moment and in an unlucky hour he came into my house, this
LINE 92: knight-errant—would that I had never set eyes on him, for dear he has
LINE 93: cost me; the last time he went off with the overnight score against him
LINE 94: for supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his squire and a
LINE 95: hack and an ass, saying he was a knight adventurer—God send unlucky
LINE 96: adventures to him and all the adventurers in the world—and therefore
LINE 97: not bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantry
LINE 98: tariff: and then, all because of him, came the other gentleman and
LINE 99: carried off my tail, and gives it back more than two cuartillos the
LINE 100: worse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for my husband's
LINE 101: purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my wine-skins
LINE 102: and spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let him not
LINE 103: deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of my
LINE 104: mother, they shall pay me down every quarto; or my name is not what it
LINE 105: is, and I am not my father's daughter." All this and more to the same
LINE 106: effect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid
LINE 107: Maritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled
LINE 108: from time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make
LINE 109: good all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the
LINE 110: wine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the
LINE 111: tail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling
LINE 112: him that she pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that
LINE 113: his master had decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully
LINE 114: established in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there
LINE 115: was in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess
LINE 116: she might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and more
LINE 117: by token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was
LINE 118: not to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that
LINE 119: house went by enchantment, as he himself had proved the last time he
LINE 120: had lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need
LINE 121: not be uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished. All
LINE 122: therefore being appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the
LINE 123: novel, as he saw there was but little more left to read. Dorothea and
LINE 124: the others begged him to finish it, and he, as he was willing to please
LINE 125: them, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued the tale in these
LINE 126: words:
LINE 127: The result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla's
LINE 128: virtue, he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely
LINE 129: looked coldly on Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelings
LINE 130: towards him to be the opposite of what they were; and the better to
LINE 131: support the position, Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the
LINE 132: house, as the displeasure with which Camilla regarded his presence was
LINE 133: plain to be seen. But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no account
LINE 134: allow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author of
LINE 135: his own dishonour, while he believed he was insuring his happiness.
LINE 136: Meanwhile the satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered to
LINE 137: carry on her amour reached such a height that, regardless of everything
LINE 138: else, she followed her inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident
LINE 139: that her mistress would screen her, and even show her how to manage it
LINE 140: safely. At last one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela's room,
LINE 141: and on trying to enter to see who it was, he found that the door was
LINE 142: held against him, which made him all the more determined to open it;
LINE 143: and exerting his strength he forced it open, and entered the room in
LINE 144: time to see a man leaping through the window into the street. He ran
LINE 145: quickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was unable to
LINE 146: effect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him crying, "Be
LINE 147: calm, señor; do not give way to passion or follow him who has escaped
LINE 148: from this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband."
LINE 149: Anselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and
LINE 150: threatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would kill
LINE 151: her. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, "Do
LINE 152: not kill me, señor, for I can tell you things more important than any
LINE 153: you can imagine."
LINE 154: "Tell me then at once or thou diest," said Anselmo.
LINE 155: "It would be impossible for me now," said Leonela, "I am so agitated:
LINE 156: leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill
LINE 157: you with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the
LINE 158: window is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to
LINE 159: become my husband."
LINE 160: Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she
LINE 161: asked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla,
LINE 162: so satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room,
LINE 163: and left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until
LINE 164: she had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to
LINE 165: see Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him
LINE 166: and her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him
LINE 167: matters of serious importance.
LINE 168: There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so
LINE 169: great was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good
LINE 170: reason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her
LINE 171: faithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if her
LINE 172: suspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thought
LINE 173: that Anselmo was asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she had
LINE 174: and some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from the
LINE 175: house and betook herself to Lothario's, to whom she related what had
LINE 176: occurred, imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or fly
LINE 177: with her where they might be safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity
LINE 178: to which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to utter
LINE 179: a word in reply, still less to decide upon what he should do. At length
LINE 180: he resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his was
LINE 181: prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which the
LINE 182: circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left her
LINE 183: there, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of
LINE 184: his departure.
LINE 185: As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his
LINE 186: side, rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to
LINE 187: the room where he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but
LINE 188: found no Leonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a
LINE 189: plain proof that she had let herself down from it and escaped. He
LINE 190: returned, uneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or
LINE 191: anywhere in the house he was lost in amazement. He asked the servants
LINE 192: of the house about her, but none of them could give him any
LINE 193: explanation. As he was going in search of Camilla it happened by chance
LINE 194: that he observed her boxes were lying open, and that the greater part
LINE 195: of her jewels were gone; and now he became fully aware of his disgrace,
LINE 196: and that Leonela was not the cause of his misfortune; and, just as he
LINE 197: was, without delaying to dress himself completely, he repaired, sad at
LINE 198: heart and dejected, to his friend Lothario to make known his sorrow to
LINE 199: him; but when he failed to find him and the servants reported that he
LINE 200: had been absent from his house all night and had taken with him all the
LINE 201: money he had, he felt as though he were losing his senses; and to make
LINE 202: all complete on returning to his own house he found it deserted and
LINE 203: empty, not one of all his servants, male or female, remaining in it. He
LINE 204: knew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to be
LINE 205: deserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and saw
LINE 206: himself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned,
LINE 207: he felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of his
LINE 208: honour, for in Camilla's disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long
LINE 209: reflection he resolved at last to go to his friend's village, where he
LINE 210: had been staying when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of
LINE 211: this complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of his house,
LINE 212: mounted his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his journey; but
LINE 213: he had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he had
LINE 214: to dismount and tie his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threw
LINE 215: himself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there he
LINE 216: remained till nearly nightfall, when he observed a man approaching on
LINE 217: horseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him, he asked what was
LINE 218: the news in Florence.
LINE 219: The citizen replied, "The strangest that have been heard for many a
LINE 220: day; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the
LINE 221: wealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night
LINE 222: Camilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has
LINE 223: been told by a maid-servant of Camilla's, whom the governor found last
LINE 224: night lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo's house.
LINE 225: I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know
LINE 226: is that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could
LINE 227: have expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate
LINE 228: friendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they
LINE 229: were called 'The Two Friends.'"
LINE 230: "Is it known at all," said Anselmo, "what road Lothario and Camilla
LINE 231: took?"
LINE 232: "Not in the least," said the citizen, "though the governor has been
LINE 233: very active in searching for them."
LINE 234: "God speed you, señor," said Anselmo.
LINE 235: "God be with you," said the citizen and went his way.
LINE 236: This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his
LINE 237: senses but of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached
LINE 238: the house of his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but
LINE 239: seeing him come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was
LINE 240: suffering some heavy affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed
LINE 241: to retire to rest, and to be given writing materials. His wish was
LINE 242: complied with and he was left lying down and alone, for he desired
LINE 243: this, and even that the door should be locked. Finding himself alone he
LINE 244: so took to heart the thought of his misfortune that by the signs of
LINE 245: death he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to a close,
LINE 246: and therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the
LINE 247: cause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put down
LINE 248: all he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life,
LINE 249: a victim to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed
LINE 250: upon him. The master of the house observing that it was now late and
LINE 251: that Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his
LINE 252: indisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his body
LINE 253: partly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay with
LINE 254: the written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having first
LINE 255: called to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,
LINE 256: and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was
LINE 257: dead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to
LINE 258: witness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the
LINE 259: paper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which
LINE 260: contained these words:
LINE 261: "A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of
LINE 262: my death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive
LINE 263: her, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have
LINE 264: required her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my
LINE 265: own dishonour, there is no reason why—"
LINE 266: So far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,
LINE 267: before he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The
LINE 268: next day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives,
LINE 269: who had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent
LINE 270: where Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on
LINE 271: that inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death,
LINE 272: but because of those she received of her lover's departure. Although
LINE 273: she saw herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the
LINE 274: convent or take the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence
LINE 275: reached her that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de
LINE 276: Lautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo
LINE 277: Fernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, whither her too late
LINE 278: repentant lover had repaired. On learning this Camilla took the veil,
LINE 279: and shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. This was
LINE 280: the end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning.
LINE 281: "I like this novel," said the curate; "but I cannot persuade myself of
LINE 282: its truth; and if it has been invented, the author's invention is
LINE 283: faulty, for it is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to
LINE 284: try such a costly experiment as Anselmo's. If it had been represented
LINE 285: as occurring between a gallant and his mistress it might pass; but
LINE 286: between husband and wife there is something of an impossibility about
LINE 287: it. As to the way in which the story is told, however, I have no fault
LINE 288: to find."
