LINE 3: The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote
LINE 4: listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:
LINE 5: "Of a surety, señor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you
LINE 6: for the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I
LINE 7: were in a condition to requite with something more than good-will that
LINE 8: which you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have
LINE 9: given me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning
LINE 10: kindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them."
LINE 11: "Mine," replied Don Quixote, "is to be of service to you, so much so
LINE 12: that I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you,
LINE 13: and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for
LINE 14: that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to
LINE 15: labour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search
LINE 16: had been necessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one of
LINE 17: those that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my
LINE 18: purpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I
LINE 19: could; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who can
LINE 20: feel for it. And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with
LINE 21: any kind of courtesy, I entreat you, señor, by that which I perceive
LINE 22: you possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whatever
LINE 23: you love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and the
LINE 24: cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a
LINE 25: brute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your
LINE 26: condition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear," added Don
LINE 27: Quixote, "by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by my
LINE 28: vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with
LINE 29: all the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your
LINE 30: misfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as
LINE 31: I promised to do."
LINE 32: The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk
LINE 33: in this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again,
LINE 34: and again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly
LINE 35: examined him, he said to him:
LINE 36: "If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it me, and
LINE 37: after I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the
LINE 38: goodwill you have displayed towards me."
LINE 39: Sancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished the
LINE 40: Ragged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gave
LINE 41: him he ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no time
LINE 42: between mouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate
LINE 43: neither he nor they who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had
LINE 44: done he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led
LINE 45: them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of
LINE 46: a rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the
LINE 47: others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One,
LINE 48: settling himself in his place, said:
LINE 49: "If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the
LINE 50: surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the
LINE 51: thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the
LINE 52: instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end."
LINE 53: These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his
LINE 54: squire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had
LINE 55: crossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to
LINE 56: the Ragged One, he went on to say:
LINE 57: "I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story
LINE 58: of my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add
LINE 59: fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end
LINE 60: of the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of
LINE 61: importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity."
LINE 62: Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this
LINE 63: assurance he began as follows:
LINE 64: "My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this
LINE 65: Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great
LINE 66: that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without
LINE 67: being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can
LINE 68: do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country
LINE 69: there was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could
LINE 70: desire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich
LINE 71: as I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so
LINE 72: worthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored
LINE 73: from my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the
LINE 74: innocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of our
LINE 75: feelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly
LINE 76: that as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a
LINE 77: thing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families
LINE 78: and wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us,
LINE 79: so that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to
LINE 80: refuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps imitating the parents
LINE 81: of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added
LINE 82: love to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon
LINE 83: our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can make
LINE 84: known the heart's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for
LINE 85: many a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will
LINE 86: and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many letters did I
LINE 87: write her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how many
LINE 88: ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and
LINE 89: made known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its
LINE 90: recollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient
LINE 91: and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to
LINE 92: put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of
LINE 93: winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my
LINE 94: lawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for
LINE 95: the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as
LINE 96: honoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was
LINE 97: alive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in
LINE 98: accordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be
LINE 99: taken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting
LINE 100: that there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent
LINE 101: to it as soon as I should tell him, and with that view I went the very
LINE 102: same instant to let him know what my desires were. When I entered the
LINE 103: room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which,
LINE 104: before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, 'By this letter thou
LINE 105: wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve
LINE 106: thee.' This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a
LINE 107: grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I
LINE 108: took and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering that
LINE 109: even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with
LINE 110: the request the duke made in it, which was that he would send me
LINE 111: immediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion, not
LINE 112: servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of
LINE 113: placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held
LINE 114: me. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I
LINE 115: heard my father say, 'Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in
LINE 116: accordance with the duke's wish, and give thanks to God who is opening
LINE 117: a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost
LINE 118: deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The
LINE 119: time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told
LINE 120: her all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him
LINE 121: to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I
LINE 122: should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise,
LINE 123: and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I
LINE 124: presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so
LINE 125: kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants
LINE 126: growing envious of me, and regarding the duke's inclination to show me
LINE 127: favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave
LINE 128: the greatest pleasure was the duke's second son, Fernando by name, a
LINE 129: gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very
LINE 130: soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody;
LINE 131: for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did
LINE 132: not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don
LINE 133: Fernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends no secret
LINE 134: remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had
LINE 135: grown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to me, and in
LINE 136: particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little. He was
LINE 137: deeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father's, the
LINE 138: daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest,
LINE 139: discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in
LINE 140: which of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled.
LINE 141: The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando
LINE 142: to such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome her
LINE 143: virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her to become
LINE 144: her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an
LINE 145: impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the
LINE 146: best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to
LINE 147: restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced
LINE 148: no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted
LINE 149: with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd,
LINE 150: foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good
LINE 151: servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to
LINE 152: the honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he
LINE 153: told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the
LINE 154: beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months,
LINE 155: and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us,
LINE 156: to my father's house under the pretence, which he would make to the
LINE 157: duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my
LINE 158: city, which produces the best in the world. When I heard him say so,
LINE 159: even if his resolution had not been so good a one I should have hailed
LINE 160: it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted by my
LINE 161: affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offered
LINE 162: me of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I
LINE 163: commended his idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it
LINE 164: into execution as quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced
LINE 165: its effect in spite of the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as
LINE 166: afterwards appeared, when he said this to me he had already enjoyed the
LINE 167: peasant girl under the title of husband, and was waiting for an
LINE 168: opportunity of making it known with safety to himself, being in dread
LINE 169: of what his father the duke would do when he came to know of his folly.
LINE 170: It happened, then, that as with young men love is for the most part
LINE 171: nothing more than appetite, which, as its final object is enjoyment,
LINE 172: comes to an end on obtaining it, and that which seemed to be love takes
LINE 173: to flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed by nature, which fixes no
LINE 174: limit to true love—what I mean is that after Don Fernando had enjoyed
LINE 175: this peasant girl his passion subsided and his eagerness cooled, and if
LINE 176: at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love,
LINE 177: he was now in reality anxious to go to avoid keeping his promise.
LINE 178: "The duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we
LINE 179: arrived at my city, and my father gave him the reception due to his
LINE 180: rank; I saw Luscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or
LINE 181: deadened, my love gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story of
LINE 182: it to Don Fernando, for I thought that in virtue of the great
LINE 183: friendship he bore me I was bound to conceal nothing from him. I
LINE 184: extolled her beauty, her gaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praises
LINE 185: excited in him a desire to see a damsel adorned by such attractions. To
LINE 186: my misfortune I yielded to it, showing her to him one night by the
LINE 187: light of a taper at a window where we used to talk to one another. As
LINE 188: she appeared to him in her dressing-gown, she drove all the beauties he
LINE 189: had seen until then out of his recollection; speech failed him, his
LINE 190: head turned, he was spell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you
LINE 191: will see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and to inflame
LINE 192: still further his passion, which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven
LINE 193: alone, it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreating
LINE 194: me to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate, so modest, and
LINE 195: so tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were
LINE 196: combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were
LINE 197: distributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I
LINE 198: own it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to
LINE 199: praise Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his
LINE 200: mouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him,
LINE 201: for there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and
LINE 202: he would start the subject himself even though he dragged it in
LINE 203: unseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of
LINE 204: jealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of
LINE 205: Luscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me
LINE 206: against. Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to
LINE 207: Luscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed the
LINE 208: wit and sense of both. It so happened, then, that Luscinda having
LINE 209: begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of,
LINE 210: Amadis of Gaul—"
LINE 211: Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:
LINE 212: "Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady
LINE 213: Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have
LINE 214: been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding,
LINE 215: for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste
LINE 216: for such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned,
LINE 217: you need waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and
LINE 218: intelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her
LINE 219: to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world;
LINE 220: and I wish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the
LINE 221: worthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly
LINE 222: relish Daraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd
LINE 223: Darinel, and the admirable verses of his bucolics, sung and delivered
LINE 224: by him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come when
LINE 225: this omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is needed
LINE 226: than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village,
LINE 227: for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the
LINE 228: delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;—though it occurs
LINE 229: to me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the spite of
LINE 230: wicked and envious enchanters;—but pardon me for having broken the
LINE 231: promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hear
LINE 232: chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking about
LINE 233: them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of the
LINE 234: moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more to
LINE 235: the purpose now."
LINE 236: While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall
LINE 237: upon his breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice
LINE 238: Don Quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor
LINE 239: uttered a word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and
LINE 240: said, "I cannot get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world
LINE 241: remove it, or make me think otherwise—and he would be a blockhead who
LINE 242: would hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master
LINE 243: Elisabad made free with Queen Madasima."
LINE 244: "That is not true, by all that's good," said Don Quixote in high wrath,
LINE 245: turning upon him angrily, as his way was; "and it is a very great
LINE 246: slander, or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious
LINE 247: lady, and it is not to be supposed that so exalted a princess would
LINE 248: have made free with a quack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies
LINE 249: like a great scoundrel, and I will give him to know it, on foot or on
LINE 250: horseback, armed or unarmed, by night or by day, or as he likes best."
LINE 251: Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now come
LINE 252: upon him, he had no disposition to go on with his story, nor would Don
LINE 253: Quixote have listened to it, so much had what he had heard about
LINE 254: Madasima disgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she
LINE 255: were in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy
LINE 256: books brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he
LINE 257: heard himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting
LINE 258: names, not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near
LINE 259: him, and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote's breast that he
LINE 260: laid him on his back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this
LINE 261: fashion, attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One
LINE 262: received him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched
LINE 263: him at his feet, and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own
LINE 264: satisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same
LINE 265: fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly
LINE 266: withdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the
LINE 267: rage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran
LINE 268: to take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them
LINE 269: warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they
LINE 270: had known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves.
LINE 271: The goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard
LINE 272: him, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd
LINE 273: rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the
LINE 274: beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made
LINE 275: peace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.
LINE 276: "Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance," said Sancho,
LINE 277: grappling with the goatherd, "for of this fellow, who is a clown like
LINE 278: myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the
LINE 279: affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an
LINE 280: honest man."
LINE 281: "That is true," said Don Quixote, "but I know that he is not to blame
LINE 282: for what has happened."
LINE 283: With this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be
LINE 284: possible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the
LINE 285: end of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before,
LINE 286: that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that
LINE 287: if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to
LINE 288: fall in with him either in or out of his senses.
