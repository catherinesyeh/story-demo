LINE 3: It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the
LINE 4: fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on
LINE 5: account of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account;
LINE 6: so turning aside to right they came upon another road, different from
LINE 7: that which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don
LINE 8: Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something
LINE 9: that shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and
LINE 10: said:
LINE 11: "I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being
LINE 12: maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences,
LINE 13: especially that one that says, 'Where one door shuts, another opens.' I
LINE 14: say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we
LINE 15: were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now
LINE 16: opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure,
LINE 17: and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I
LINE 18: cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the
LINE 19: night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one
LINE 20: who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took
LINE 21: the oath thou rememberest."
LINE 22: "Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do," said
LINE 23: Sancho, "for I don't want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling
LINE 24: and knocking our senses out."
LINE 25: "The devil take thee, man," said Don Quixote; "what has a helmet to do
LINE 26: with fulling mills?"
LINE 27: "I don't know," replied Sancho, "but, faith, if I might speak as I
LINE 28: used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you
LINE 29: were mistaken in what you say."
LINE 30: "How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?" returned
LINE 31: Don Quixote; "tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us
LINE 32: on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?"
LINE 33: "What I see and make out," answered Sancho, "is only a man on a grey
LINE 34: ass like my own, who has something that shines on his head."
LINE 35: "Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino," said Don Quixote; "stand to one
LINE 36: side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a
LINE 37: word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and
LINE 38: possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for."
LINE 39: "I will take care to stand aside," said Sancho; "but God grant, I say
LINE 40: once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills."
LINE 41: "I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling
LINE 42: mills to me again," said Don Quixote, "or I vow—and I say no more—I'll
LINE 43: full the soul out of you."
LINE 44: Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow
LINE 45: he had hurled like a bowl at him.
LINE 46: The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that
LINE 47: Don Quixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two
LINE 48: villages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop
LINE 49: nor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of
LINE 50: the larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who
LINE 51: required to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on
LINE 52: this errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but
LINE 53: as luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not
LINE 54: to spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his
LINE 55: head, and being clean it glittered at half a league's distance. He rode
LINE 56: upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don
LINE 57: Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for
LINE 58: everything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and
LINE 59: ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without
LINE 60: entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed he bore
LINE 61: down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him
LINE 62: through and through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury
LINE 63: of his charge, he cried to him:
LINE 64: "Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that
LINE 65: which is so reasonably my due."
LINE 66: The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this
LINE 67: apparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself
LINE 68: from the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and
LINE 69: no sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than
LINE 70: a deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.
LINE 71: He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented
LINE 72: himself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated
LINE 73: the beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts
LINE 74: off with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it
LINE 75: is pursued.
LINE 76: He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands
LINE 77: said:
LINE 78: "By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is
LINE 79: worth a maravedis," and handed it to his master, who immediately put it
LINE 80: on his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of
LINE 81: fitment, and not finding it he said, "Clearly the pagan to whose
LINE 82: measure this famous head-piece was first forged must have had a very
LINE 83: large head; but the worst of it is half of it is wanting."
LINE 84: When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to
LINE 85: restrain his laughter, but remembering his master's wrath he checked
LINE 86: himself in the midst of it.
LINE 87: "What art thou laughing at, Sancho?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 88: "I am laughing," said he, "to think of the great head the pagan must
LINE 89: have had who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular
LINE 90: barber's basin."
LINE 91: "Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?" said Don Quixote; "that this
LINE 92: wonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident
LINE 93: have come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise or
LINE 94: realise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to
LINE 95: be of the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of
LINE 96: what it might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a
LINE 97: barber's basin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise
LINE 98: it, its transformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights
LINE 99: at the first village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style
LINE 100: that that helmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles
LINE 101: shall not surpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will
LINE 102: wear it as well as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the
LINE 103: more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a
LINE 104: stone."
LINE 105: "That is," said Sancho, "if it is not shot with a sling as they were in
LINE 106: the battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your
LINE 107: worship's grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that
LINE 108: made me vomit my bowels up."
LINE 109: "It does not grieve me much to have lost it," said Don Quixote, "for
LINE 110: thou knowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory."
LINE 111: "So have I," answered Sancho, "but if ever I make it, or try it again
LINE 112: as long as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no
LINE 113: intention of putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with
LINE 114: all my five senses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding
LINE 115: anyone: as to being blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to
LINE 116: prevent mishaps of that sort, and if they come there is nothing for it
LINE 117: but to squeeze our shoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes,
LINE 118: and let ourselves go where luck and the blanket may send us."
LINE 119: "Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho," said Don Quixote on hearing this,
LINE 120: "for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but
LINE 121: know that it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach
LINE 122: importance to trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken
LINE 123: rib, what cracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest
LINE 124: and sport it was, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that
LINE 125: light I would have returned and done more mischief in revenging thee
LINE 126: than the Greeks did for the rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now,
LINE 127: or if my Dulcinea had lived then, might depend upon it she would not be
LINE 128: so famous for her beauty as she is;" and here he heaved a sigh and sent
LINE 129: it aloft; and said Sancho, "Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be
LINE 130: revenged in earnest, but I know what sort of jest and earnest it was,
LINE 131: and I know it will never be rubbed out of my memory any more than off
LINE 132: my shoulders. But putting that aside, will your worship tell me what
LINE 133: are we to do with this dapple-grey steed that looks like a grey ass,
LINE 134: which that Martino that your worship overthrew has left deserted here?
LINE 135: for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted, he is not likely
LINE 136: ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey is a good one."
LINE 137: "I have never been in the habit," said Don Quixote, "of taking spoil of
LINE 138: those whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away
LINE 139: their horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the
LINE 140: victor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to
LINE 141: take that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,
LINE 142: Sancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;
LINE 143: for when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it."
LINE 144: "God knows I should like to take it," returned Sancho, "or at least to
LINE 145: change it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily
LINE 146: the laws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let
LINE 147: one ass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at
LINE 148: least change trappings."
LINE 149: "On that head I am not quite certain," answered Don Quixote, "and the
LINE 150: matter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest
LINE 151: change them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them."
LINE 152: "So urgent is it," answered Sancho, "that if they were for my own
LINE 153: person I could not want them more;" and forthwith, fortified by this
LINE 154: licence, he effected the _mutatio capparum_, and rigged out his beast
LINE 155: to the ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done,
LINE 156: they broke their fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered
LINE 157: from the sumpter mule, and drank of the brook that flowed from the
LINE 158: fulling mills, without casting a look in that direction, in such
LINE 159: loathing did they hold them for the alarm they had caused them; and,
LINE 160: all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, without taking any fixed
LINE 161: road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true
LINE 162: knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante's will, which
LINE 163: carried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,
LINE 164: which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;
LINE 165: nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a
LINE 166: venture without any other aim.
LINE 167: As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master,
LINE 168: "Señor, would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For
LINE 169: since you laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things
LINE 170: have gone to rot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of
LINE 171: my tongue that I don't want to be spoiled."
LINE 172: "Say, on, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and be brief in thy discourse,
LINE 173: for there is no pleasure in one that is long."
LINE 174: "Well then, señor," returned Sancho, "I say that for some days past I
LINE 175: have been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of
LINE 176: these adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and
LINE 177: cross-roads, where, even if the most perilous are victoriously
LINE 178: achieved, there is no one to see or know of them, and so they must be
LINE 179: left untold for ever, to the loss of your worship's object and the
LINE 180: credit they deserve; therefore it seems to me it would be better
LINE 181: (saving your worship's better judgment) if we were to go and serve some
LINE 182: emperor or other great prince who may have some war on hand, in whose
LINE 183: service your worship may prove the worth of your person, your great
LINE 184: might, and greater understanding, on perceiving which the lord in whose
LINE 185: service we may be will perforce have to reward us, each according to
LINE 186: his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someone to set down
LINE 187: your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memory for ever.
LINE 188: Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirely limits,
LINE 189: though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalry to
LINE 190: write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out."
LINE 191: "Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho," answered Don Quixote, "but before
LINE 192: that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on
LINE 193: probation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name
LINE 194: and fame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the
LINE 195: court of some great monarch the knight may be already known by his
LINE 196: deeds, and that the boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of
LINE 197: the city, may all follow him and surround him, crying, 'This is the
LINE 198: Knight of the Sun'—or the Serpent, or any other title under which he
LINE 199: may have achieved great deeds. 'This,' they will say, 'is he who
LINE 200: vanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength;
LINE 201: he who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long
LINE 202: enchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.' So
LINE 203: from one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and
LINE 204: presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that
LINE 205: kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as
LINE 206: he beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on
LINE 207: his shield, he will as a matter of course say, 'What ho! Forth all ye,
LINE 208: the knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh
LINE 209: hither!' At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,
LINE 210: advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and
LINE 211: salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the
LINE 212: queen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her
LINE 213: daughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished
LINE 214: damsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the
LINE 215: known world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her
LINE 216: eyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the
LINE 217: other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why
LINE 218: they will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and
LINE 219: sorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their
LINE 220: pains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no
LINE 221: doubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having
LINE 222: removed his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet
LINE 223: wherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he will
LINE 224: look still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the
LINE 225: king, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes
LINE 226: off her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she
LINE 227: will do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a
LINE 228: damsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through
LINE 229: the door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf
LINE 230: followed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain
LINE 231: adventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it
LINE 232: shall be deemed the best knight in the world.
LINE 233: "The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none
LINE 234: will bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the
LINE 235: great enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed
LINE 236: and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed
LINE 237: her thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince,
LINE 238: or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as
LINE 239: powerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some
LINE 240: days at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the
LINE 241: said war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will
LINE 242: courteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night
LINE 243: he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the
LINE 244: chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he
LINE 245: has already many times conversed with her, the go-between and
LINE 246: confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.
LINE 247: He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much
LINE 248: distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady
LINE 249: he would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come
LINE 250: to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the
LINE 251: knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing
LINE 252: them with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to
LINE 253: inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will
LINE 254: entreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will
LINE 255: promise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes
LINE 256: his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes
LINE 257: him thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for
LINE 258: sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of
LINE 259: the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair,
LINE 260: it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a
LINE 261: visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart
LINE 262: is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The
LINE 263: confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who
LINE 264: listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not
LINE 265: knowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not;
LINE 266: the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry
LINE 267: of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who
LINE 268: was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she
LINE 269: strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her
LINE 270: parents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile
LINE 271: the knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the
LINE 272: king's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to
LINE 273: the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed
LINE 274: that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of
LINE 275: his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he
LINE 276: is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it
LINE 277: may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to
LINE 278: regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is
LINE 279: proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not
LINE 280: what, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies,
LINE 281: the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And
LINE 282: here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all
LINE 283: who have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his
LINE 284: squire to a damsel of the princess's, who will be, no doubt, the one
LINE 285: who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great
LINE 286: duke."
LINE 287: "That's what I want, and no mistake about it!" said Sancho. "That's
LINE 288: what I'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your
LINE 289: worship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance."
LINE 290: "Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "for in the
LINE 291: same manner, and by the same steps as I have described here,
LINE 292: knights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we
LINE 293: want now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and
LINE 294: has a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think of
LINE 295: that, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters
LINE 296: before repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that is
LINE 297: wanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful
LINE 298: daughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,
LINE 299: I know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even
LINE 300: second cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give
LINE 301: me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on
LINE 302: this point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by
LINE 303: this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True
LINE 304: it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and
LINE 305: entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sage
LINE 306: who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree
LINE 307: that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I
LINE 308: would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in
LINE 309: the world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings
LINE 310: and princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a
LINE 311: point like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common
LINE 312: herd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;
LINE 313: so that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,
LINE 314: and the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such
LINE 315: that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with
LINE 316: which the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;
LINE 317: and should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she
LINE 318: well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her
LINE 319: lord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to
LINE 320: seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will
LINE 321: put an end to the wrath of her parents."
LINE 322: "It comes to this, too," said Sancho, "what some naughty people say,
LINE 323: 'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it would
LINE 324: fit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.'
LINE 325: I say so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law,
LINE 326: will not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing
LINE 327: for it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But
LINE 328: the mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful
LINE 329: enjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as
LINE 330: rewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his
LINE 331: wife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad
LINE 332: luck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,
LINE 333: may as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife."
LINE 334: "Nobody can object to that," said Don Quixote.
LINE 335: "Then since that may be," said Sancho, "there is nothing for it but to
LINE 336: commend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will."
LINE 337: "God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants," said Don Quixote,
LINE 338: "and mean be he who thinks himself mean."
LINE 339: "In God's name let him be so," said Sancho: "I am an old Christian, and
LINE 340: to fit me for a count that's enough."
LINE 341: "And more than enough for thee," said Don Quixote; "and even wert thou
LINE 342: not, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily
LINE 343: give thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for
LINE 344: when I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they
LINE 345: may say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee
LINE 346: 'your lordship,' whether they like it or not."
LINE 347: "Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle," said
LINE 348: Sancho.
LINE 349: "Title thou shouldst say, not tittle," said his master.
LINE 350: "So be it," answered Sancho. "I say I will know how to behave, for once
LINE 351: in my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so
LINE 352: well on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same
LINE 353: brotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my
LINE 354: back, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe
LINE 355: they'll come a hundred leagues to see me."
LINE 356: "Thou wilt look well," said Don Quixote, "but thou must shave thy beard
LINE 357: often, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou
LINE 358: dost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou
LINE 359: art at the distance of a musket shot."
LINE 360: "What more will it be," said Sancho, "than having a barber, and keeping
LINE 361: him at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him
LINE 362: go behind me like a nobleman's equerry."
LINE 363: "Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?"
LINE 364: asked Don Quixote.
LINE 365: "I will tell you," answered Sancho. "Years ago I was for a month at the
LINE 366: capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they
LINE 367: said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in
LINE 368: every turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man
LINE 369: did not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they
LINE 370: answered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with
LINE 371: nobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,
LINE 372: for I have never forgotten it."
LINE 373: "Thou art right," said Don Quixote, "and in the same way thou mayest
LINE 374: carry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all
LINE 375: together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the
LINE 376: first count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's
LINE 377: beard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse."
LINE 378: "Let the barber business be my look-out," said Sancho; "and your
LINE 379: worship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count."
LINE 380: "So it shall be," answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw
LINE 381: what will be told in the following chapter.
