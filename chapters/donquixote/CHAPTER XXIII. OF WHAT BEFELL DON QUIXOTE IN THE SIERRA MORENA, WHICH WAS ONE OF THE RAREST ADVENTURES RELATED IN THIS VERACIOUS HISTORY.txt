LINE 3: Seeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, "I
LINE 4: have always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw
LINE 5: water into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided
LINE 6: this trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take
LINE 7: warning for the future."

LINE 10: "Your worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk," returned
LINE 11: Sancho; "but, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you
LINE 12: had believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be
LINE 13: avoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy
LINE 14: Brotherhood, and they don't care two maravedis for all the
LINE 15: knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their
LINE 16: arrows whistling past my ears this minute."
LINE 17: "Thou art a coward by nature, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "but lest thou
LINE 18: shouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise,
LINE 19: this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that
LINE 20: fury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in
LINE 21: life or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew
LINE 22: from this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy
LINE 23: entreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and
LINE 24: from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say
LINE 25: thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and
LINE 26: answer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or
LINE 27: retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry
LINE 28: some little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here
LINE 29: and await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread,
LINE 30: but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven
LINE 31: Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods
LINE 32: in the world."
LINE 33: "Señor," replied Sancho, "to retire is not to flee, and there is no
LINE 34: wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of
LINE 35: wise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all
LINE 36: in one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have
LINE 37: got some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having
LINE 38: taken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help
LINE 39: you; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of
LINE 40: legs than hands just now."
LINE 41: Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on
LINE 42: his ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close
LINE 43: by, as it was Sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out again
LINE 44: at El Viso or Almodóvar del Campo, and hide for some days among its
LINE 45: crags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to
LINE 46: look for them. He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock
LINE 47: of provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the
LINE 48: galley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing how
LINE 49: they pillaged and ransacked.

LINE 52: That night they reached the very heart of the Sierra Morena, where it
LINE 53: seemed prudent to Sancho to pass the night and even some days, at least
LINE 54: as many as the stores he carried might last, and so they encamped
LINE 55: between two rocks and among some cork trees; but fatal destiny, which,
LINE 56: according to the opinion of those who have not the light of the true
LINE 57: faith, directs, arranges, and settles everything in its own way, so
LINE 58: ordered it that Gines de Pasamonte, the famous knave and thief who by
LINE 59: the virtue and madness of Don Quixote had been released from the chain,
LINE 60: driven by fear of the Holy Brotherhood, which he had good reason to
LINE 61: dread, resolved to take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear
LINE 62: led him to the same spot to which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had been
LINE 63: led by theirs, just in time to recognise them and leave them to fall
LINE 64: asleep: and as the wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to
LINE 65: evildoing, and immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the
LINE 66: future, Gines, who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up
LINE 67: his mind to steal Sancho Panza's ass, not troubling himself about
LINE 68: Rocinante, as being a prize that was no good either to pledge or sell.
LINE 69: While Sancho slept he stole his ass, and before day dawned he was far
LINE 70: out of reach.

LINE 73: Aurora made her appearance bringing gladness to the earth but sadness
LINE 74: to Sancho Panza, for he found that his Dapple was missing, and seeing
LINE 75: himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in
LINE 76: the world, so loud that Don Quixote awoke at his exclamations and heard
LINE 77: him saying, "O son of my bowels, born in my very house, my children's
LINE 78: plaything, my wife's joy, the envy of my neighbours, relief of my
LINE 79: burdens, and lastly, half supporter of myself, for with the
LINE 80: six-and-twenty maravedis thou didst earn me daily I met half my
LINE 81: charges."
LINE 82: Don Quixote, when he heard the lament and learned the cause, consoled
LINE 83: Sancho with the best arguments he could, entreating him to be patient,
LINE 84: and promising to give him a letter of exchange ordering three out of
LINE 85: five ass-colts that he had at home to be given to him. Sancho took
LINE 86: comfort at this, dried his tears, suppressed his sobs, and returned
LINE 87: thanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote. He on his part was
LINE 88: rejoiced to the heart on entering the mountains, as they seemed to him
LINE 89: to be just the place for the adventures he was in quest of. They
LINE 90: brought back to his memory the marvellous adventures that had befallen
LINE 91: knights-errant in like solitudes and wilds, and he went along
LINE 92: reflecting on these things, so absorbed and carried away by them that
LINE 93: he had no thought for anything else.

LINE 96: Nor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in
LINE 97: a safe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were
LINE 98: left of the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden
LINE 99: with what Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his
LINE 100: paunch, and so long as he could go that way, he would not have given a
LINE 101: farthing to meet with another adventure.
LINE 102: While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,
LINE 103: and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object
LINE 104: that lay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him
LINE 105: if it were needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike
LINE 106: he was raising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or
LINE 107: rather wholly rotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had
LINE 108: to help to take them up, and his master directed him to see what the
LINE 109: valise contained. Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the
LINE 110: valise was secured by a chain and padlock, from its torn and rotten
LINE 111: condition he was able to see its contents, which were four shirts of
LINE 112: fine holland, and other articles of linen no less curious than clean;
LINE 113: and in a handkerchief he found a good lot of gold crowns, and as soon
LINE 114: as he saw them he exclaimed:
LINE 115: "Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good for
LINE 116: something!"
LINE 117: Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this
LINE 118: Don Quixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it for
LINE 119: himself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise
LINE 120: of its linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering
LINE 121: the whole matter, Don Quixote observed:
LINE 122: "It seems to me, Sancho—and it is impossible it can be otherwise—that
LINE 123: some strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked
LINE 124: and slain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury
LINE 125: him."
LINE 126: "That cannot be," answered Sancho, "because if they had been robbers
LINE 127: they would not have left this money."
LINE 128: "Thou art right," said Don Quixote, "and I cannot guess or explain what
LINE 129: this may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there is
LINE 130: anything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what
LINE 131: we want to know."
LINE 132: He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but
LINE 133: in a very good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho
LINE 134: might hear it, he found that it ran as follows:
LINE 135: SONNET
LINE 136: Or Love is lacking in intelligence,
LINE 137: Or to the height of cruelty attains,
LINE 138: Or else it is my doom to suffer pains
LINE 139: Beyond the measure due to my offence.
LINE 140: But if Love be a God, it follows thence
LINE 141: That he knows all, and certain it remains
LINE 142: No God loves cruelty; then who ordains
LINE 143: This penance that enthrals while it torments?
LINE 144: It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;
LINE 145: Such evil with such goodness cannot live;
LINE 146: And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,
LINE 147: I only know it is my fate to die.
LINE 148: To him who knows not whence his malady
LINE 149: A miracle alone a cure can give.

LINE 152: "There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme," said Sancho, "unless
LINE 153: by that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole
LINE 154: matter."
LINE 155: "What clue is there?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 156: "I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it," said Sancho.
LINE 157: "I only said Chloe," replied Don Quixote; "and that no doubt, is the
LINE 158: name of the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and,
LINE 159: faith, he must be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft."
LINE 160: "Then your worship understands rhyming too?"
LINE 161: "And better than thou thinkest," replied Don Quixote, "as thou shalt
LINE 162: see when thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end
LINE 163: to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho,
LINE 164: that all or most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great
LINE 165: troubadours and great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or
LINE 166: more properly speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of
LINE 167: lovers-errant: true it is that the verses of the knights of old have
LINE 168: more spirit than neatness in them."
LINE 169: "Read more, your worship," said Sancho, "and you will find something
LINE 170: that will enlighten us."
LINE 171: Don Quixote turned the page and said, "This is prose and seems to be a
LINE 172: letter."
LINE 173: "A correspondence letter, señor?"
LINE 174: "From the beginning it seems to be a love letter," replied Don Quixote.
LINE 175: "Then let your worship read it aloud," said Sancho, "for I am very fond
LINE 176: of love matters."
LINE 177: "With all my heart," said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho
LINE 178: had requested him, he found it ran thus:
LINE 179: Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence the
LINE 180: news of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.
LINE 181: Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not
LINE 182: more worthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy
LINE 183: the fortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy
LINE 184: beauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be
LINE 185: an angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast
LINE 186: sent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever
LINE 187: hidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I
LINE 188: reap not a revenge I would not have.
LINE 189: When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, "There is less to be
LINE 190: gathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is
LINE 191: some rejected lover;" and turning over nearly all the pages of the book
LINE 192: he found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while
LINE 193: others he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,
LINE 194: misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some
LINE 195: rapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho
LINE 196: examined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the
LINE 197: pad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did
LINE 198: not rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything
LINE 199: should escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness
LINE 200: excited in him by the discovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a
LINE 201: hundred; and though he found no more booty, he held the blanket
LINE 202: flights, balsam vomits, stake benedictions, carriers' fisticuffs,
LINE 203: missing alforjas, stolen coat, and all the hunger, thirst, and
LINE 204: weariness he had endured in the service of his good master, cheap at
LINE 205: the price; as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for all
LINE 206: by the payment he received in the gift of the treasure-trove.
LINE 207: The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out
LINE 208: who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and
LINE 209: letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts,
LINE 210: that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of
LINE 211: his lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that
LINE 212: uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he
LINE 213: could inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, taking
LINE 214: whatever road Rocinante chose—which was where he could make his
LINE 215: way—firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet
LINE 216: some rare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with these
LINE 217: thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their
LINE 218: eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to
LINE 219: tussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he was
LINE 220: unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and
LINE 221: feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet
LINE 222: but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.
LINE 223: c23g.jpg (360K)
LINE 224: Full Size
LINE 225: He was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he
LINE 226: passed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance
LINE 227: observed and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt,
LINE 228: he was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness
LINE 229: of Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover,
LINE 230: slow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to the
LINE 231: conclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise,
LINE 232: and made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should have
LINE 233: to wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so he
LINE 234: directed Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain,
LINE 235: while he himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means they
LINE 236: might light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight.
LINE 237: "I could not do that," said Sancho, "for when I separate from your
LINE 238: worship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of
LINE 239: panics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this
LINE 240: time forth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence."
LINE 241: "It shall be so," said he of the Rueful Countenance, "and I am very
LINE 242: glad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail
LINE 243: thee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind
LINE 244: me slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let
LINE 245: us make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man
LINE 246: that we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found."
LINE 247: To which Sancho made answer, "Far better would it be not to look for
LINE 248: him, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money,
LINE 249: it is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that
LINE 250: without taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it
LINE 251: until in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner
LINE 252: may be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it,
LINE 253: and then the king will hold me harmless."
LINE 254: "Thou art wrong there, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "for now that we have
LINE 255: a suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are
LINE 256: bound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the
LINE 257: strong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty
LINE 258: as if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him
LINE 259: give thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine."
LINE 260: And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on
LINE 261: foot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the
LINE 262: mountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs
LINE 263: and pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still
LINE 264: further strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner
LINE 265: of the mule and the saddle-pad.

LINE 268: As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a
LINE 269: shepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared
LINE 270: a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain
LINE 271: the goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote
LINE 272: called aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He
LINE 273: shouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or
LINE 274: never trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other
LINE 275: wild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down,
LINE 276: and they would explain all to him.
LINE 277: The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,
LINE 278: he said, "I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead
LINE 279: in the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six
LINE 280: months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?"
LINE 281: "We have come upon nobody," answered Don Quixote, "nor on anything
LINE 282: except a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from
LINE 283: this."
LINE 284: "I found it too," said the goatherd, "but I would not lift it nor go
LINE 285: near it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the
LINE 286: devil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall
LINE 287: without knowing why or wherefore."
LINE 288: "That's exactly what I say," said Sancho; "I found it too, and I would
LINE 289: not go within a stone's throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies
LINE 290: just as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell."
LINE 291: "Tell me, good man," said Don Quixote, "do you know who is the owner of
LINE 292: this property?"
LINE 293: "All I can tell you," said the goatherd, "is that about six months ago,
LINE 294: more or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps,
LINE 295: away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on
LINE 296: that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and
LINE 297: valise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part
LINE 298: of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was
LINE 299: where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a
LINE 300: league farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and
LINE 301: I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road
LINE 302: or path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our
LINE 303: answer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to
LINE 304: him, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his
LINE 305: question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of
LINE 306: the sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days
LINE 307: afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without
LINE 308: saying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and
LINE 309: kicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the
LINE 310: bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again
LINE 311: into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds
LINE 312: learned this we went in search of him for about two days through the
LINE 313: most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him
LINE 314: lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us
LINE 315: with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so
LINE 316: disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but
LINE 317: that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we
LINE 318: had of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us
LINE 319: courteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at
LINE 320: seeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in
LINE 321: order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been
LINE 322: imposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never
LINE 323: able to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of
LINE 324: food, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find
LINE 325: him, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or
LINE 326: if this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and
LINE 327: not take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,
LINE 328: begged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask
LINE 329: it in God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed
LINE 330: abode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever
LINE 331: night might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping
LINE 332: so bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we
LINE 333: not joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with
LINE 334: what we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,
LINE 335: and in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good
LINE 336: birth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to
LINE 337: him, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it
LINE 338: plain.
LINE 339: "But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,
LINE 340: keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we
LINE 341: stood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this
LINE 342: abstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now
LINE 343: staring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving
LINE 344: an eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his
LINE 345: eyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind
LINE 346: had come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was
LINE 347: the truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown
LINE 348: himself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and
LINE 349: fierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten
LINE 350: or bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, 'Oh faithless
LINE 351: Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast
LINE 352: done me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and
LINE 353: dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to
LINE 354: these he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and
LINE 355: charging him with treachery and faithlessness.
LINE 356: "We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and
LINE 357: without another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these
LINE 358: brakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;
LINE 359: from this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and
LINE 360: that someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous
LINE 361: nature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to
LINE 362: show. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, and
LINE 363: they have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time to
LINE 364: beg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at another
LINE 365: to take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon
LINE 366: him, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it
LINE 367: but snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in his
LINE 368: senses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and
LINE 369: receives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you the
LINE 370: truth, sirs," continued the goatherd, "it was yesterday that we
LINE 371: resolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the
LINE 372: other two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,
LINE 373: and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to
LINE 374: the town of Almodóvar, which is eight leagues from this, and there
LINE 375: strive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn
LINE 376: when he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we
LINE 377: may give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in
LINE 378: answer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the
LINE 379: articles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and
LINE 380: so naked."
LINE 381: For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go
LINE 382: bounding along the mountainside, and he was now filled with amazement
LINE 383: at what he heard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to
LINE 384: discover who the unhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as
LINE 385: he had done before, to search for him all over the mountain, not
LINE 386: leaving a corner or cave unexamined until he had found him. But chance
LINE 387: arranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very
LINE 388: moment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the
LINE 389: youth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking to
LINE 390: himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much
LINE 391: more at a distance. His garb was what has been described, save that as
LINE 392: he drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he
LINE 393: wore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore such
LINE 394: garments could not be of very low rank.
LINE 395: Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice
LINE 396: but with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal
LINE 397: politeness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred
LINE 398: bearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in
LINE 399: his arms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may
LINE 400: call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the
LINE 401: Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and,
LINE 402: placing his hands on Don Quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him as if
LINE 403: seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the
LINE 404: sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote
LINE 405: was at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak after
LINE 406: embracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on.
