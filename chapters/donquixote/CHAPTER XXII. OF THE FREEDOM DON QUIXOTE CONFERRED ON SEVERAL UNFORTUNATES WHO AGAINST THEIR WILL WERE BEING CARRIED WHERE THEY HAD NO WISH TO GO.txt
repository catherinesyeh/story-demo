LINE 3: Cid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this
LINE 4: most grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history
LINE 5: that after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha
LINE 6: and his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter
LINE 7: twenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road
LINE 8: he was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck,
LINE 9: like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their
LINE 10: hands. With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot;
LINE 11: those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins
LINE 12: and swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:
LINE 13: "That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force
LINE 14: of the king's orders."
LINE 15: "How by force?" asked Don Quixote; "is it possible that the king uses
LINE 16: force against anyone?"
LINE 17: "I do not say that," answered Sancho, "but that these are people
LINE 18: condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys."
LINE 19: "In fact," replied Don Quixote, "however it may be, these people are
LINE 20: going where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will."
LINE 21: "Just so," said Sancho.
LINE 22: "Then if so," said Don Quixote, "here is a case for the exercise of my
LINE 23: office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched."
LINE 24: "Recollect, your worship," said Sancho, "Justice, which is the king
LINE 25: himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but
LINE 26: punishing them for their crimes."
LINE 27: The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in
LINE 28: very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be
LINE 29: good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were
LINE 30: conducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback
LINE 31: answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that
LINE 32: they were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said
LINE 33: and all he had any business to know.

LINE 36: "Nevertheless," replied Don Quixote, "I should like to know from each
LINE 37: of them separately the reason of his misfortune;" to this he added more
LINE 38: to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly
LINE 39: that the other mounted guard said to him:
LINE 40: "Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of
LINE 41: every one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read
LINE 42: them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they
LINE 43: will, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about
LINE 44: rascalities."
LINE 45: With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they
LINE 46: not granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what
LINE 47: offences he was now in such a sorry case.
LINE 48: He made answer that it was for being a lover.
LINE 49: "For that only?" replied Don Quixote; "why, if for being lovers they
LINE 50: send people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago."
LINE 51: "The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of," said the galley
LINE 52: slave; "mine was that I loved a washerwoman's basket of clean linen so
LINE 53: well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law
LINE 54: had not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will
LINE 55: to this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for
LINE 56: torture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on
LINE 57: the back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of
LINE 58: it."
LINE 59: "What are gurapas?" asked Don Quixote.
LINE 60: "Gurapas are galleys," answered the galley slave, who was a young man
LINE 61: of about four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.
LINE 62: Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply,
LINE 63: so downcast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and
LINE 64: said, "He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer."
LINE 65: "What!" said Don Quixote, "for being musicians and singers are people
LINE 66: sent to the galleys too?"
LINE 67: "Yes, sir," answered the galley slave, "for there is nothing worse than
LINE 68: singing under suffering."
LINE 69: "On the contrary, I have heard say," said Don Quixote, "that he who
LINE 70: sings scares away his woes."
LINE 71: "Here it is the reverse," said the galley slave; "for he who sings once
LINE 72: weeps all his life."
LINE 73: "I do not understand it," said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said
LINE 74: to him, "Sir, to sing under suffering means with the _non sancta_
LINE 75: fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to the
LINE 76: torture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is
LINE 77: a cattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years
LINE 78: in the galleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had on
LINE 79: the back; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other
LINE 80: thieves that were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub,
LINE 81: and jeer, and despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough
LINE 82: to say nay; for, say they, 'nay' has no more letters in it than 'yea,'
LINE 83: and a culprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his
LINE 84: own tongue and not on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking
LINE 85: they are not very far out."
LINE 86: "And I think so too," answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the
LINE 87: third he asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered
LINE 88: very readily and unconcernedly, "I am going for five years to their
LINE 89: ladyships the gurapas for the want of ten ducats."
LINE 90: "I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble," said
LINE 91: Don Quixote.
LINE 92: "That," said the galley slave, "is like a man having money at sea when
LINE 93: he is dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so
LINE 94: because if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your
LINE 95: worship now offers me, I would have greased the notary's pen and
LINE 96: freshened up the attorney's wit with them, so that to-day I should be
LINE 97: in the middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this
LINE 98: road coupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience—there, that's
LINE 99: enough of it."
LINE 100: Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a
LINE 101: white beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the
LINE 102: reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but
LINE 103: the fifth acted as his tongue and said, "This worthy man is going to
LINE 104: the galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony
LINE 105: and on horseback."
LINE 106: "That means," said Sancho Panza, "as I take it, to have been exposed to
LINE 107: shame in public."
LINE 108: "Just so," replied the galley slave, "and the offence for which they
LINE 109: gave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay
LINE 110: body-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and
LINE 111: for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him."
LINE 112: "If that touch had not been thrown in," said Don Quixote, "he would not
LINE 113: deserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command
LINE 114: and be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,
LINE 115: being the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a
LINE 116: well-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;
LINE 117: nay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other
LINE 118: offices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this
LINE 119: way many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office
LINE 120: and calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as
LINE 121: women more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and
LINE 122: experience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of
LINE 123: contrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their
LINE 124: mouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go
LINE 125: farther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those
LINE 126: who are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not
LINE 127: the fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someone
LINE 128: able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional
LINE 129: fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see
LINE 130: these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a
LINE 131: position on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are
LINE 132: no sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some
LINE 133: simple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm
LINE 134: that can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to
LINE 135: turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power
LINE 136: to cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the
LINE 137: will."
LINE 138: "It is true," said the good old man, "and indeed, sir, as far as the
LINE 139: charge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I
LINE 140: cannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my
LINE 141: only object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in
LINE 142: peace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions
LINE 143: were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back
LINE 144: from, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that
LINE 145: never gives me a moment's ease;" and again he fell to weeping as
LINE 146: before, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a
LINE 147: real of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.
LINE 148: Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man
LINE 149: answered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last
LINE 150: one.
LINE 151: "I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins
LINE 152: of mine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in
LINE 153: short, I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a
LINE 154: complicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:
LINE 155: it was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was
LINE 156: near having my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six
LINE 157: years, I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a
LINE 158: young man; let life only last, and with that all will come right. If
LINE 159: you, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it
LINE 160: to you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to
LINE 161: him to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be
LINE 162: as long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves."
LINE 163: This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he
LINE 164: was a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.
LINE 165: Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,
LINE 166: except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the
LINE 167: other. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a
LINE 168: chain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on
LINE 169: his neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a
LINE 170: "keep-friend" or "friend's foot," from which hung two irons reaching to
LINE 171: his waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were
LINE 172: secured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to
LINE 173: his mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this
LINE 174: man carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that
LINE 175: it was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put
LINE 176: together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they
LINE 177: marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in
LINE 178: dread of his making his escape.
LINE 179: "What crimes can he have committed," said Don Quixote, "if they have
LINE 180: not deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?"
LINE 181: "He goes for ten years," replied the guard, "which is the same thing as
LINE 182: civil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the
LINE 183: famous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla."
LINE 184: "Gently, señor commissary," said the galley slave at this, "let us have
LINE 185: no fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my
LINE 186: family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind
LINE 187: his own business, and he will be doing enough."
LINE 188: "Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure," replied
LINE 189: the commissary, "if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue in
LINE 190: spite of your teeth."
LINE 191: "It is easy to see," returned the galley slave, "that man goes as God
LINE 192: pleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo
LINE 193: de Parapilla or not."
LINE 194: "Don't they call you so, you liar?" said the guard.
LINE 195: "They do," returned Gines, "but I will make them give over calling me
LINE 196: so, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you,
LINE 197: sir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed
LINE 198: you, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about
LINE 199: the lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I
LINE 200: am Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers."
LINE 201: "He says true," said the commissary, "for he has himself written his
LINE 202: story as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in
LINE 203: pawn for two hundred reals."
LINE 204: "And I mean to take it out of pawn," said Gines, "though it were in for
LINE 205: two hundred ducats."
LINE 206: "Is it so good?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 207: "So good is it," replied Gines, "that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,'
LINE 208: and all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written
LINE 209: compared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts,
LINE 210: and facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them."
LINE 211: "And how is the book entitled?" asked Don Quixote.
LINE 212: "The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'" replied the subject of it.
LINE 213: "And is it finished?" asked Don Quixote.
LINE 214: "How can it be finished," said the other, "when my life is not yet
LINE 215: finished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when
LINE 216: they sent me to the galleys this last time."
LINE 217: "Then you have been there before?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 218: "In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years
LINE 219: before now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are
LINE 220: like," replied Gines; "and it is no great grievance to me to go back to
LINE 221: them, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many
LINE 222: things left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than
LINE 223: enough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for
LINE 224: I have it by heart."
LINE 225: "You seem a clever fellow," said Don Quixote.
LINE 226: "And an unfortunate one," replied Gines, "for misfortune always
LINE 227: persecutes good wit."
LINE 228: "It persecutes rogues," said the commissary.
LINE 229: "I told you already to go gently, master commissary," said Pasamonte;
LINE 230: "their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us
LINE 231: wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;
LINE 232: if not, by the life of—never mind—; it may be that some day the stains
LINE 233: made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his
LINE 234: tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for
LINE 235: we have had quite enough of this entertainment."
LINE 236: The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his
LINE 237: threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to
LINE 238: ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied
LINE 239: to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of
LINE 240: them he said:
LINE 241: "From all you have told me, dear brethren, I make out clearly that
LINE 242: though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are
LINE 243: about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them
LINE 244: very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps
LINE 245: this one's want of courage under torture, that one's want of money, the
LINE 246: other's want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the
LINE 247: judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to
LINE 248: obtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself now
LINE 249: to my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate
LINE 250: in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and
LINE 251: caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I
LINE 252: belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and
LINE 253: under the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of
LINE 254: prudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask
LINE 255: these gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release
LINE 256: you and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to
LINE 257: serve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me
LINE 258: a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free.
LINE 259: Moreover, sirs of the guard," added Don Quixote, "these poor fellows
LINE 260: have done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder;
LINE 261: there is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or
LINE 262: reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the
LINE 263: instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way
LINE 264: concerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you
LINE 265: comply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will
LINE 266: not voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my arm
LINE 267: shall compel you to comply with it by force."
LINE 268: "Nice nonsense!" said the commissary; "a fine piece of pleasantry he
LINE 269: has come out with at last! He wants us to let the king's prisoners go,
LINE 270: as if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so!
LINE 271: Go your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that
LINE 272: you've got on your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat."
LINE 273: "'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal," replied Don Quixote, and
LINE 274: acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him
LINE 275: time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with
LINE 276: a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had
LINE 277: the musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this
LINE 278: unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback
LINE 279: seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don
LINE 280: Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it
LINE 281: would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance
LINE 282: before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving
LINE 283: to break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,
LINE 284: that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking
LINE 285: loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing
LINE 286: at all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to
LINE 287: release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the
LINE 288: plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,
LINE 289: took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and
LINE 290: levelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one
LINE 291: of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape
LINE 292: Pasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley
LINE 293: slaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the
LINE 294: affair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the
LINE 295: matter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell
LINE 296: would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to
LINE 297: his master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into
LINE 298: hiding in the sierra that was close by.
LINE 299: "That is all very well," said Don Quixote, "but I know what must be
LINE 300: done now;" and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now
LINE 301: running riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected
LINE 302: them round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as
LINE 303: follows: "To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons
LINE 304: of good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is
LINE 305: ingratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest
LINE 306: proof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,
LINE 307: and it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have
LINE 308: taken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El
LINE 309: Toboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del
LINE 310: Toboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance,
LINE 311: sends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in full
LINE 312: detail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to the
LINE 313: recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye
LINE 314: will, and good fortune attend you."
LINE 315: Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, "That which you, sir,
LINE 316: our deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most
LINE 317: impossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the
LINE 318: roads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way,
LINE 319: endeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the
LINE 320: Holy Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What
LINE 321: your worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and
LINE 322: tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity
LINE 323: of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship's
LINE 324: intention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night
LINE 325: as by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that
LINE 326: we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take
LINE 327: up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now
LINE 328: night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us
LINE 329: is like asking pears of the elm tree."
LINE 330: "Then by all that's good," said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath),
LINE 331: "Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name
LINE 332: is, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your
LINE 333: legs and the whole chain on your back."
LINE 334: Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly
LINE 335: convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had
LINE 336: committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in
LINE 337: this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they
LINE 338: began to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite
LINE 339: unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more
LINE 340: heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted
LINE 341: himself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the
LINE 342: hailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield
LINE 343: himself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him
LINE 344: full on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;
LINE 345: and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the
LINE 346: basin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his
LINE 347: shoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to
LINE 348: pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his
LINE 349: armour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves
LINE 350: had not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in
LINE 351: his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils
LINE 352: of the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous about
LINE 353: keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about
LINE 354: burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves
LINE 355: before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and
LINE 356: Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with
LINE 357: drooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he
LINE 358: thought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over;
LINE 359: Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to
LINE 360: the ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the
LINE 361: Holy Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by
LINE 362: the very persons for whom he had done so much.
