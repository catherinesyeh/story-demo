LINE 3: In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the
LINE 4: renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two
LINE 5: such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they
LINE 6: would at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and
LINE 7: laid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the
LINE 8: delightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any
LINE 9: intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.
LINE 10: This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having
LINE 11: read such a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor
LINE 12: chance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it
LINE 13: seemed to me, was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to
LINE 14: me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so good
LINE 15: a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of
LINE 16: writing his marvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to
LINE 17: any of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for
LINE 18: every one of them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not
LINE 19: only recorded their deeds but described their most trifling thoughts
LINE 20: and follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight could
LINE 21: not have been so unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like
LINE 22: him had in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that
LINE 23: such a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the
LINE 24: blame on Time, the devourer and destroyer of all things, that had
LINE 25: either concealed or consumed it.
LINE 26: On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there
LINE 27: had been found such modern ones as "The Enlightenment of Jealousy" and
LINE 28: the "Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares," his story must likewise be
LINE 29: modern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the
LINE 30: memory of the people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood.
LINE 31: This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly
LINE 32: the whole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote
LINE 33: of La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first
LINE 34: that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour
LINE 35: and exercise of the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs,
LINE 36: succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used to
LINE 37: ride about, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginity
LINE 38: about them, from mountain to mountain and valley to valleyâ€”for, if it
LINE 39: were not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, or
LINE 40: monstrous giant, that forced them, there were in days of yore damsels
LINE 41: that at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slept
LINE 42: a day under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothers
LINE 43: that bore them. I say, then, that in these and other respects our
LINE 44: gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, nor
LINE 45: should it be withheld even from me for the labour and pains spent in
LINE 46: searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know
LINE 47: well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the
LINE 48: world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure
LINE 49: that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it
LINE 50: attentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.
LINE 51: One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some
LINE 52: pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading
LINE 53: even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent
LINE 54: of mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw
LINE 55: that it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was
LINE 56: unable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to
LINE 57: see if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for
LINE 58: me; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter,
LINE 59: for even had I sought one for an older and better language I should
LINE 60: have found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told
LINE 61: him what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in the
LINE 62: middle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked him
LINE 63: what he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the
LINE 64: book had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it to
LINE 65: me; and he still laughing said, "In the margin, as I told you, this is
LINE 66: written: '_This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history,
LINE 67: had, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting
LINE 68: pigs_.'"
LINE 69: When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and
LINE 70: amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained
LINE 71: the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the
LINE 72: beginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he
LINE 73: told me it meant, "_History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid
LINE 74: Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian_." It required great caution to
LINE 75: hide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and
LINE 76: snatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and
LINE 77: pamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits
LINE 78: about him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safely
LINE 79: calculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at
LINE 80: once with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged
LINE 81: him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the
LINE 82: Castilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering
LINE 83: him whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas of
LINE 84: raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them
LINE 85: faithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and
LINE 86: not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my
LINE 87: house, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the
LINE 88: whole just as it is set down here.
LINE 89: In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan
LINE 90: was drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the
LINE 91: history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his
LINE 92: buckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to
LINE 93: nature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The
LINE 94: Biscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, "_Don Sancho de
LINE 95: Azpeitia_," which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of
LINE 96: Rocinante was another that said, "_Don Quixote_." Rocinante was
LINE 97: marvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so
LINE 98: much backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainly
LINE 99: with what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been
LINE 100: bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his
LINE 101: ass, at whose feet was another label that said, "Sancho Zancas," and
LINE 102: according to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body,
LINE 103: and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and
LINE 104: Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several
LINE 105: times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned,
LINE 106: but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the
LINE 107: true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it
LINE 108: is true.
LINE 109: If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its
LINE 110: truth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very
LINE 111: common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such
LINE 112: enemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather
LINE 113: than additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;
LINE 114: for, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so
LINE 115: worthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in
LINE 116: silence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business
LINE 117: and duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from
LINE 118: passion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make
LINE 119: them swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of
LINE 120: time, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel
LINE 121: for the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be
LINE 122: found all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting
LINE 123: in any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an
LINE 124: author and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part,
LINE 125: according to the translation, began in this way:
LINE 126: With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though
LINE 127: the two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and
LINE 128: earth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear
LINE 129: themselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which
LINE 130: was delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in
LINE 131: its course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the
LINE 132: bitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good
LINE 133: fortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword
LINE 134: of his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder,
LINE 135: it did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour,
LINE 136: carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all
LINE 137: which with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry
LINE 138: plight.
LINE 139: Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that
LINE 140: filled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in
LINE 141: this fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised
LINE 142: himself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both
LINE 143: hands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full
LINE 144: over the cushion and over the head, thatâ€”even so good a shield proving
LINE 145: uselessâ€”as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from
LINE 146: nose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his
LINE 147: mule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about
LINE 148: its neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the
LINE 149: stirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at
LINE 150: the terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plunges
LINE 151: flung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on very
LINE 152: calmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with great
LINE 153: briskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to his
LINE 154: eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayan
LINE 155: was so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it would
LINE 156: have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies
LINE 157: in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great
LINE 158: terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest
LINE 159: entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their
LINE 160: squire's life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and
LINE 161: dignity, "In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of
LINE 162: me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that
LINE 163: this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my
LINE 164: behalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal
LINE 165: with him as shall be most pleasing to her."
LINE 166: The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote's
LINE 167: demand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire
LINE 168: should do all that had been commanded.
LINE 169: "Then, on the faith of that promise," said Don Quixote, "I shall do him
LINE 170: no further harm, though he well deserves it of me."
