LINE 3: The curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, "In faith,
LINE 4: then, señor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it was
LINE 5: not for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what
LINE 6: he was about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they
LINE 7: were all on the march there because they were special scoundrels."
LINE 8: "Blockhead!" said Don Quixote at this, "it is no business or concern of
LINE 9: knights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains,
LINE 10: or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and
LINE 11: suffer as they do because of their faults or because of their
LINE 12: misfortunes. It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of
LINE 13: help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I
LINE 14: encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people,
LINE 15: and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the
LINE 16: rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the
LINE 17: sacred dignity of the señor licentiate and his honoured person, I say
LINE 18: he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and
LINE 19: this I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;" and
LINE 20: so saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his
LINE 21: morion; for the barber's basin, which according to him was Mambrino's
LINE 22: helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the
LINE 23: damage done to it by the galley slaves.
LINE 24: Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly
LINE 25: understood Don Quixote's crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza
LINE 26: were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on
LINE 27: observing his irritation, "Sir Knight, remember the boon you have
LINE 28: promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any
LINE 29: other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the
LINE 30: licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that
LINE 31: unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even
LINE 32: bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that
LINE 33: tended towards disrespect of your worship."
LINE 34: "That I swear heartily," said the curate, "and I would have even
LINE 35: plucked off a moustache."
LINE 36: "I will hold my peace, señora," said Don Quixote, "and I will curb the
LINE 37: natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace
LINE 38: and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this
LINE 39: consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do
LINE 40: so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are
LINE 41: the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am
LINE 42: to take vengeance on your behalf?"
LINE 43: "That I will do with all my heart," replied Dorothea, "if it will not
LINE 44: be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes."
LINE 45: "It will not be wearisome, señora," said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea
LINE 46: replied, "Well, if that be so, give me your attention." As soon as she
LINE 47: said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to
LINE 48: hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for
LINE 49: herself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as
LINE 50: his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle,
LINE 51: and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to
LINE 52: think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.
LINE 53: "First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is—" and here
LINE 54: she stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had given
LINE 55: her; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and
LINE 56: said, "It is no wonder, señora, that your highness should be confused
LINE 57: and embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such
LINE 58: afflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory,
LINE 59: so that they do not even remember their own names, as is the case now
LINE 60: with your ladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the Princess
LINE 61: Micomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and with
LINE 62: this cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection
LINE 63: all you may wish to tell us."
LINE 64: "That is the truth," said the damsel; "but I think from this on I shall
LINE 65: have no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe
LINE 66: into port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio
LINE 67: the Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became
LINE 68: aware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was
LINE 69: to die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this
LINE 70: life, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all
LINE 71: this, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his
LINE 72: certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island
LINE 73: close to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name—for it is
LINE 74: averred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he
LINE 75: always looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of
LINE 76: malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at—that he
LINE 77: knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition
LINE 78: would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not
LINE 79: leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid
LINE 80: all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however,
LINE 81: as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a
LINE 82: marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it
LINE 83: has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be
LINE 84: ever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead,
LINE 85: and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait
LINE 86: and attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but
LINE 87: that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to
LINE 88: avoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for
LINE 89: there would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant's
LINE 90: devilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set
LINE 91: out for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a
LINE 92: certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the
LINE 93: whole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don
LINE 94: Azote or Don Gigote."
LINE 95: "'Don Quixote,' he must have said, señora," observed Sancho at this,
LINE 96: "otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance."
LINE 97: "That is it," said Dorothea; "he said, moreover, that he would be tall
LINE 98: of stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left
LINE 99: shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like
LINE 100: bristles."
LINE 101: On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, "Here, Sancho my son,
LINE 102: bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight
LINE 103: that sage king foretold."
LINE 104: "What does your worship want to strip for?" said Dorothea.
LINE 105: "To see if I have that mole your father spoke of," answered Don
LINE 106: Quixote.
LINE 107: "There is no occasion to strip," said Sancho; "for I know your worship
LINE 108: has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark
LINE 109: of a strong man."
LINE 110: "That is enough," said Dorothea, "for with friends we must not look too
LINE 111: closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the
LINE 112: backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where
LINE 113: it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the
LINE 114: truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending
LINE 115: myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the
LINE 116: features of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this
LINE 117: knight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all
LINE 118: La Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such
LINE 119: accounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me he was the
LINE 120: very one I had come in search of."
LINE 121: "But how did you land at Osuna, señora," asked Don Quixote, "when it is
LINE 122: not a seaport?"
LINE 123: But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying,
LINE 124: "The princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the
LINE 125: first place where she heard of your worship was Osuna."
LINE 126: "That is what I meant to say," said Dorothea.
LINE 127: "And that would be only natural," said the curate. "Will your majesty
LINE 128: please proceed?"
LINE 129: "There is no more to add," said Dorothea, "save that in finding Don
LINE 130: Quixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard
LINE 131: myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy
LINE 132: and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me
LINE 133: whithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face
LINE 134: to face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and
LINE 135: restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must
LINE 136: come to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient
LINE 137: foretold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or
LINE 138: Greek characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted
LINE 139: knight, after having cut the giant's throat, should be disposed to
LINE 140: marry me I was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful
LINE 141: wife, and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person."
LINE 142: "What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?" said Don Quixote at this.
LINE 143: "Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got
LINE 144: a kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!"
LINE 145: "On my oath it is so," said Sancho; "and foul fortune to him who won't
LINE 146: marry after slitting Señor Pandahilado's windpipe! And then, how
LINE 147: illfavoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!"
LINE 148: And so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of
LINE 149: extreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea's
LINE 150: mule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give
LINE 151: him her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen
LINE 152: and mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see
LINE 153: the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea
LINE 154: therefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her
LINE 155: kingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and
LINE 156: enjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all
LINE 157: laughing again.
LINE 158: "This, sirs," continued Dorothea, "is my story; it only remains to tell
LINE 159: you that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have
LINE 160: none left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a
LINE 161: great tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came
LINE 162: to land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole
LINE 163: course of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed;
LINE 164: and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I
LINE 165: ought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the
LINE 166: beginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the
LINE 167: sufferers of their memory."
LINE 168: "They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess," said
LINE 169: Don Quixote, "however great and unexampled those which I shall endure
LINE 170: in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have
LINE 171: promised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until
LINE 172: I find myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head
LINE 173: I trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this—I will
LINE 174: not say good sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried away
LINE 175: mine"—(this he said between his teeth, and then continued), "and when
LINE 176: it has been cut off and you have been put in peaceful possession of
LINE 177: your realm it shall be left to your own decision to dispose of your
LINE 178: person as may be most pleasing to you; for so long as my memory is
LINE 179: occupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by her—I
LINE 180: say no more—it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate
LINE 181: marriage, even with a Phœnix."
LINE 182: The last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so
LINE 183: disagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great
LINE 184: irritation:
LINE 185: "By my oath, Señor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for
LINE 186: how can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted
LINE 187: princess as this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every
LINE 188: stone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea
LINE 189: fairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far
LINE 190: as to say she does not come up to the shoe of this one here. A poor
LINE 191: chance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your worship
LINE 192: goes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil's
LINE 193: name, marry, marry, and take this kingdom that comes to hand without
LINE 194: any trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or governor of a
LINE 195: province, and for the rest let the devil take it all."
LINE 196: Don Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady
LINE 197: Dulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying
LINE 198: anything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks
LINE 199: that he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea
LINE 200: cried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on
LINE 201: the spot.
LINE 202: "Do you think," he said to him after a pause, "you scurvy clown, that
LINE 203: you are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always
LINE 204: offending and I always pardoning? Don't fancy it, impious scoundrel,
LINE 205: for that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going
LINE 206: against the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar,
LINE 207: that were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm I should
LINE 208: not have strength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper's
LINE 209: tongue, what think you has won this kingdom and cut off this giant's
LINE 210: head and made you a marquis (for all this I count as already
LINE 211: accomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, employing my arm
LINE 212: as the instrument of her achievements? She fights in me and conquers in
LINE 213: me, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and being to her. O
LINE 214: whoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raised
LINE 215: from the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and the return you make
LINE 216: for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred it
LINE 217: upon you!"
LINE 218: Sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and
LINE 219: rising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind
LINE 220: Dorothea's palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:
LINE 221: "Tell me, señor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this great
LINE 222: princess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so,
LINE 223: how can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Let
LINE 224: your worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her
LINE 225: here as if showered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to
LINE 226: my lady Dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept
LINE 227: mistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the
LINE 228: truth is to be told, I like them both; though I have never seen the
LINE 229: lady Dulcinea."
LINE 230: "How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!" exclaimed Don Quixote;
LINE 231: "hast thou not just now brought me a message from her?"
LINE 232: "I mean," said Sancho, "that I did not see her so much at my leisure
LINE 233: that I could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms
LINE 234: piecemeal; but taken in the lump I like her."
LINE 235: "Now I forgive thee," said Don Quixote; "and do thou forgive me the
LINE 236: injury I have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our
LINE 237: control."
LINE 238: "That I see," replied Sancho, "and with me the wish to speak is always
LINE 239: the first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what I
LINE 240: have on the tip of my tongue."
LINE 241: "For all that, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "take heed of what thou
LINE 242: sayest, for the pitcher goes so often to the well—I need say no more to
LINE 243: thee."
LINE 244: "Well, well," said Sancho, "God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and
LINE 245: will judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship
LINE 246: in not doing it."
LINE 247: "That is enough," said Dorothea; "run, Sancho, and kiss your lord's
LINE 248: hand and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your
LINE 249: praise and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso,
LINE 250: of whom I know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust
LINE 251: in God, for you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like
LINE 252: a prince."
LINE 253: Sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master's hand, which
LINE 254: Don Quixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as
LINE 255: soon as he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he
LINE 256: had questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss
LINE 257: with him. Sancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in
LINE 258: advance Don Quixote said to him, "Since thy return I have had no
LINE 259: opportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission
LINE 260: and the answer thou hast brought back, and now that chance has granted
LINE 261: us the time and opportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst give
LINE 262: me by such good news."
LINE 263: "Let your worship ask what you will," answered Sancho, "for I shall
LINE 264: find a way out of all as I found a way in; but I implore you, señor,
LINE 265: not to be so revengeful in future."
LINE 266: "Why dost thou say that, Sancho?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 267: "I say it," he returned, "because those blows just now were more
LINE 268: because of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other
LINE 269: night, than for what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and
LINE 270: reverence as I would a relic—though there is nothing of that about
LINE 271: her—merely as something belonging to your worship."
LINE 272: "Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho," said Don Quixote,
LINE 273: "for it is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that,
LINE 274: and thou knowest the common saying, 'for a fresh sin a fresh penance.'"
LINE 275: While this was going on they saw coming along the road they were
LINE 276: following a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be
LINE 277: a gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he
LINE 278: saw asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de
LINE 279: Pasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass,
LINE 280: for it was, in fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape
LINE 281: recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being
LINE 282: able to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they
LINE 283: were his own. Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did
LINE 284: so he shouted to him, "Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure,
LINE 285: release my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass,
LINE 286: leave my delight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up what
LINE 287: is not thine."
LINE 288: There was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the
LINE 289: first one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and
LINE 290: got clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him
LINE 291: he said, "How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my
LINE 292: comrade?" all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a
LINE 293: human being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and
LINE 294: caressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up
LINE 295: and congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially,
LINE 296: who told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order
LINE 297: for the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.
LINE 298: While the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the
LINE 299: curate observed to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as
LINE 300: well in the story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it
LINE 301: bore to those of the books of chivalry. She said that she had many
LINE 302: times amused herself reading them; but that she did not know the
LINE 303: situation of the provinces or seaports, and so she had said at
LINE 304: haphazard that she had landed at Osuna.
LINE 305: "So I saw," said the curate, "and for that reason I made haste to say
LINE 306: what I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strange
LINE 307: thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these
LINE 308: figments and lies, simply because they are in the style and manner of
LINE 309: the absurdities of his books?"
LINE 310: "So it is," said Cardenio; "and so uncommon and unexampled, that were
LINE 311: one to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be
LINE 312: any wit keen enough to imagine it."
LINE 313: "But another strange thing about it," said the curate, "is that, apart
LINE 314: from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection
LINE 315: with his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them
LINE 316: in a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear
LINE 317: and composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no
LINE 318: one would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound
LINE 319: understanding."
LINE 320: While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his
LINE 321: with Sancho, saying:
LINE 322: "Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell
LINE 323: me now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst
LINE 324: thou find Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her?
LINE 325: What did she answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter?
LINE 326: Who copied it out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to
LINE 327: thee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying
LINE 328: to give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of
LINE 329: it."
LINE 330: "Señor," replied Sancho, "if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out
LINE 331: the letter for me, for I carried no letter at all."
LINE 332: "It is as thou sayest," said Don Quixote, "for the notebook in which I
LINE 333: wrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure,
LINE 334: which gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do
LINE 335: on finding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst
LINE 336: return from the place where thou didst first miss it."
LINE 337: "So I should have done," said Sancho, "if I had not got it by heart
LINE 338: when your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan,
LINE 339: who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in
LINE 340: all the days of his life, though he had read many a letter of
LINE 341: excommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that."
LINE 342: "And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 343: "No, señor," replied Sancho, "for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing
LINE 344: there was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I
LINE 345: recollect any of it, it is that about 'Scrubbing,' I mean to say
LINE 346: 'Sovereign Lady,' and the end 'Yours till death, the Knight of the
LINE 347: Rueful Countenance;' and between these two I put into it more than
LINE 348: three hundred 'my souls' and 'my life's' and 'my eyes."
