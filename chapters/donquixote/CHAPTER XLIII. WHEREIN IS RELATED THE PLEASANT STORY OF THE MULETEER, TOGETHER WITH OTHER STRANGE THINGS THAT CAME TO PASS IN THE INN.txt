LINE 3: Ah me, Love's mariner am I
LINE 4: On Love's deep ocean sailing;
LINE 5: I know not where the haven lies,
LINE 6: I dare not hope to gain it.
LINE 7: One solitary distant star
LINE 8: Is all I have to guide me,
LINE 9: A brighter orb than those of old
LINE 10: That Palinurus lighted.
LINE 11: And vaguely drifting am I borne,
LINE 12: I know not where it leads me;
LINE 13: I fix my gaze on it alone,
LINE 14: Of all beside it heedless.
LINE 15: But over-cautious prudery,
LINE 16: And coyness cold and cruel,
LINE 17: When most I need it, these, like clouds,
LINE 18: Its longed-for light refuse me.
LINE 19: Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes
LINE 20: As thou above me beamest,
LINE 21: When thou shalt hide thee from my sight
LINE 22: I'll know that death is near me.
LINE 23: The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair
LINE 24: to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side
LINE 25: to side, she woke her, saying:
LINE 26: "Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have
LINE 27: the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps,
LINE 28: in all thy life."
LINE 29: Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what
LINE 30: Dorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said,
LINE 31: and Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines,
LINE 32: as the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she
LINE 33: were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her
LINE 34: arms round Dorothea she said:
LINE 35: "Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest
LINE 36: kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so
LINE 37: as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician."
LINE 38: "What art thou talking about, child?" said Dorothea. "Why, they say
LINE 39: this singer is a muleteer!"
LINE 40: "Nay, he is the lord of many places," replied Clara, "and that one in
LINE 41: my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless
LINE 42: he be willing to surrender it."
LINE 43: Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed
LINE 44: to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any
LINE 45: promise of, so she said to her:
LINE 46: "You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Señora Clara;
LINE 47: explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying
LINE 48: about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?
LINE 49: But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I
LINE 50: get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your
LINE 51: transports, for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a
LINE 52: new air."
LINE 53: "Let him, in Heaven's name," returned Clara; and not to hear him she
LINE 54: stopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again
LINE 55: surprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran
LINE 56: in this fashion:
LINE 57: Sweet Hope, my stay,
LINE 58: That onward to the goal of thy intent
LINE 59: Dost make thy way,
LINE 60: Heedless of hindrance or impediment,
LINE 61: Have thou no fear
LINE 62: If at each step thou findest death is near.
LINE 63: No victory,
LINE 64: No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know;
LINE 65: Unblest is he
LINE 66: That a bold front to Fortune dares not show,
LINE 67: But soul and sense
LINE 68: In bondage yieldeth up to indolence.
LINE 69: If Love his wares
LINE 70: Do dearly sell, his right must be contest;
LINE 71: What gold compares
LINE 72: With that whereon his stamp he hath imprest?
LINE 73: And all men know
LINE 74: What costeth little that we rate but low.
LINE 75: Love resolute
LINE 76: Knows not the word "impossibility;"
LINE 77: And though my suit
LINE 78: Beset by endless obstacles I see,
LINE 79: Yet no despair
LINE 80: Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.
LINE 81: Here the voice ceased and Clara's sobs began afresh, all which excited
LINE 82: Dorothea's curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so
LINE 83: sweet and weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was
LINE 84: going to say before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear
LINE 85: her, winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to
LINE 86: her ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone
LINE 87: else, and said:
LINE 88: "This singer, dear señora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of
LINE 89: two villages, who lives opposite my father's house at Madrid; and
LINE 90: though my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter,
LINE 91: and lattice-work in summer, in some way—I know not how—this gentleman,
LINE 92: who was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I
LINE 93: cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it
LINE 94: from the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I was
LINE 95: forced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what it
LINE 96: was he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to link
LINE 97: one hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though I
LINE 98: should have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I
LINE 99: knew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing
LINE 100: him no favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to
LINE 101: raise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly,
LINE 102: at which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going
LINE 103: mad. Meanwhile the time for my father's departure arrived, which he
LINE 104: became aware of, but not from me, for I had never been able to tell him
LINE 105: of it. He fell sick, of grief I believe, and so the day we were going
LINE 106: away I could not see him to take farewell of him, were it only with the
LINE 107: eyes. But after we had been two days on the road, on entering the
LINE 108: posada of a village a day's journey from this, I saw him at the inn
LINE 109: door in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, that if I did
LINE 110: not carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossible
LINE 111: for me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I was surprised, and glad;
LINE 112: he watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he always hides
LINE 113: himself when he crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where we
LINE 114: halt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for love of me he
LINE 115: makes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die of
LINE 116: sorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not with
LINE 117: what object he has come; or how he could have got away from his father,
LINE 118: who loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because he
LINE 119: deserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I can
LINE 120: tell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heard
LINE 121: them say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I
LINE 122: see him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my
LINE 123: father should recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have never
LINE 124: spoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that I
LINE 125: could not live without him. This, dear señora, is all I have to tell
LINE 126: you about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from
LINE 127: it alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of
LINE 128: hearts and towns, as I told you already."
LINE 129: "Say no more, Doña Clara," said Dorothea at this, at the same time
LINE 130: kissing her a thousand times over, "say no more, I tell you, but wait
LINE 131: till day comes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours so
LINE 132: that it may have the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves."
LINE 133: "Ah, señora," said Doña Clara, "what end can be hoped for when his
LINE 134: father is of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think I
LINE 135: was not fit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as to
LINE 136: marrying without the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for all
LINE 137: the world. I would not ask anything more than that this youth should go
LINE 138: back and leave me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance
LINE 139: we shall have to travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier;
LINE 140: though I daresay the remedy I propose will do me very little good. I
LINE 141: don't know how the devil this has come about, or how this love I have
LINE 142: for him got in; I such a young girl, and he such a mere boy; for I
LINE 143: verily believe we are both of an age, and I am not sixteen yet; for I
LINE 144: will be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next, my father says."
LINE 145: Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Doña Clara
LINE 146: spoke. "Let us go to sleep now, señora," said she, "for the little of
LINE 147: the night that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight,
LINE 148: and we will set all to rights, or it will go hard with me."
LINE 149: With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the
LINE 150: inn. The only persons not asleep were the landlady's daughter and her
LINE 151: servant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote's
LINE 152: humour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on
LINE 153: horseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or
LINE 154: at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his
LINE 155: nonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn
LINE 156: that looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through
LINE 157: which they used to throw out the straw. At this hole the two
LINE 158: demi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse,
LINE 159: leaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth such deep and
LINE 160: doleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots with
LINE 161: each of them; and they could hear him, too, saying in a soft, tender,
LINE 162: loving tone, "Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection of all beauty,
LINE 163: summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary of
LINE 164: virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, and
LINE 165: delectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Art thou,
LINE 166: perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hath
LINE 167: exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give me
LINE 168: tidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment,
LINE 169: envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro
LINE 170: some gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,
LINE 171: meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she may
LINE 172: mitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,
LINE 173: what glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, and
LINE 174: lastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, oh
LINE 175: sun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise
LINE 176: betimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of
LINE 177: thee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see
LINE 178: her and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more
LINE 179: jealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made
LINE 180: thee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the
LINE 181: Peneus (for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on
LINE 182: that occasion) in thy jealousy and love."
LINE 183: Don Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady's
LINE 184: daughter began to signal to him, saying, "Señor, come over here,
LINE 185: please."
LINE 186: At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the
LINE 187: light of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that someone
LINE 188: was calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be
LINE 189: a window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such
LINE 190: as he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately
LINE 191: suggested itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion,
LINE 192: the fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by
LINE 193: love for him, was once more endeavouring to win his affections; and
LINE 194: with this idea, not to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he
LINE 195: turned Rocinante's head and approached the hole, and as he perceived
LINE 196: the two wenches he said:
LINE 197: "I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your
LINE 198: thoughts of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a
LINE 199: return can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle
LINE 200: birth, for which you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom
LINE 201: love renders incapable of submission to any other than her whom, the
LINE 202: first moment his eyes beheld her, he made absolute mistress of his
LINE 203: soul. Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not,
LINE 204: by any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show myself
LINE 205: more ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that
LINE 206: there is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided
LINE 207: it be not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that
LINE 208: sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that
LINE 209: you require of me a lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or
LINE 210: even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial."
LINE 211: "My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight," said Maritornes
LINE 212: at this.
LINE 213: "What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?" replied Don
LINE 214: Quixote.
LINE 215: "Only one of your fair hands," said Maritornes, "to enable her to vent
LINE 216: over it the great passion, passion which has brought her to this
LINE 217: loophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father
LINE 218: had heard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear."
LINE 219: "I should like to see that tried," said Don Quixote; "but he had better
LINE 220: beware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end
LINE 221: that ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender
LINE 222: limbs of a love-stricken daughter."
LINE 223: Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had
LINE 224: asked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole
LINE 225: and went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza's
LINE 226: ass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had
LINE 227: planted himself standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to reach the
LINE 228: grated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving
LINE 229: her his hand, he said, "Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of
LINE 230: the evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand
LINE 231: of woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of
LINE 232: my entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that
LINE 233: you may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the
LINE 234: muscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer
LINE 235: what must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand."
LINE 236: "That we shall see presently," said Maritornes, and making a running
LINE 237: knot on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from
LINE 238: the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the
LINE 239: straw-loft.
LINE 240: Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,
LINE 241: "Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it
LINE 242: not so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution
LINE 243: has given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a
LINE 244: part; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so
LINE 245: cruelly."
LINE 246: But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for
LINE 247: as soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to
LINE 248: die with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was
LINE 249: impossible for him to release himself.
LINE 250: He was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passed
LINE 251: through the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in
LINE 252: mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante
LINE 253: were to stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the
LINE 254: least movement, although from the patience and imperturbable
LINE 255: disposition of Rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would
LINE 256: stand without budging for a whole century. Finding himself fast, then,
LINE 257: and that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was
LINE 258: done by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle
LINE 259: that enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in
LINE 260: his heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the
LINE 261: castle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a
LINE 262: settled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an
LINE 263: adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not
LINE 264: reserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not try
LINE 265: it again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release
LINE 266: himself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were in
LINE 267: vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move, but
LINE 268: try as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for it
LINE 269: but to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished for
LINE 270: the sword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any
LINE 271: power; then he cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the
LINE 272: world would sustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted,
LINE 273: for that he believed he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to
LINE 274: thinking of his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he called to his
LINE 275: worthy squire Sancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and stretched upon the
LINE 276: pack-saddle of his ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother
LINE 277: that bore him; then he called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to
LINE 278: come to his aid; then he invoked his good friend Urganda to succour
LINE 279: him; and then, at last, morning found him in such a state of
LINE 280: desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing like a bull, for he
LINE 281: had no hope that day would bring any relief to his suffering, which he
LINE 282: believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he was enchanted; and of this
LINE 283: he was convinced by seeing that Rocinante never stirred, much or
LINE 284: little, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were to remain in
LINE 285: this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until the malign
LINE 286: influence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more sage
LINE 287: enchanter should disenchant him.
LINE 288: But he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had
LINE 289: hardly begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on
LINE 290: horseback, well equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their
LINE 291: saddle-bows. They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn,
LINE 292: which was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he
LINE 293: was, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and
LINE 294: imperious tone, "Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no
LINE 295: right to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that
LINE 296: they who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of
LINE 297: throwing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread over the
LINE 298: whole surface of the earth. Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is
LINE 299: broad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not
LINE 300: to open to you."
LINE 301: "What the devil fortress or castle is this," said one, "to make us
LINE 302: stand on such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us;
LINE 303: we are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we
LINE 304: are in haste."
LINE 305: "Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?" said Don
LINE 306: Quixote.
LINE 307: "I don't know what you look like," replied the other; "but I know that
LINE 308: you are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle."
LINE 309: "A castle it is," returned Don Quixote, "nay, more, one of the best in
LINE 310: this whole province, and it has within it people who have had the
LINE 311: sceptre in the hand and the crown on the head."
LINE 312: "It would be better if it were the other way," said the traveller, "the
LINE 313: sceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe there
LINE 314: is within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to
LINE 315: have those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as
LINE 316: this, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people
LINE 317: entitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters."
LINE 318: "You know but little of the world," returned Don Quixote, "since you
LINE 319: are ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry."
LINE 320: But the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with
LINE 321: Don Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that
LINE 322: the host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got
LINE 323: up to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the
LINE 324: horses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante,
LINE 325: who melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless,
LINE 326: supporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all,
LINE 327: flesh, though he looked as if he were made of wood, he could not help
LINE 328: giving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him
LINE 329: attentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his
LINE 330: footing; and slipping off the saddle, he would have come to the ground,
LINE 331: but for being suspended by the arm, which caused him such agony that he
LINE 332: believed either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; and
LINE 333: he hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet,
LINE 334: which was all the worse for him; for, finding how little was wanted to
LINE 335: enable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled and stretched himself
LINE 336: as much as he could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing the
LINE 337: torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at "touch and no touch,"
LINE 338: who aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch
LINE 339: themselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a
LINE 340: very little more they will reach the ground.
