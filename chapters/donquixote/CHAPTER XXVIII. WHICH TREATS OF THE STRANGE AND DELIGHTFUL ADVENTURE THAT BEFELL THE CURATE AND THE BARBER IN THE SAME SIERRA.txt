LINE 3: Happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight Don
LINE 4: Quixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his
LINE 5: having formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive
LINE 6: and restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of
LINE 7: knight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light
LINE 8: entertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also of
LINE 9: the tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less
LINE 10: pleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which,
LINE 11: resuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the
LINE 12: curate was going to offer consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted
LINE 13: by a voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones:
LINE 14: "O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret
LINE 15: grave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? If
LINE 16: the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe
LINE 17: is me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these
LINE 18: rocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven,
LINE 19: than that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for
LINE 20: counsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!"
LINE 21: All this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as
LINE 22: it seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up
LINE 23: to look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they
LINE 24: discovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in
LINE 25: the dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to
LINE 26: see as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that
LINE 27: flowed past. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them,
LINE 28: being fully occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they
LINE 29: looked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other
LINE 30: stones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them
LINE 31: with surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods
LINE 32: or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress suggested;
LINE 33: and so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in
LINE 34: front, made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some
LINE 35: fragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing closely
LINE 36: what the youth was about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown
LINE 37: jacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth; he wore besides
LINE 38: breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera;
LINE 39: and he had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which
LINE 40: verily seemed to be of pure alabaster.

LINE 43: As soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a
LINE 44: towel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised his
LINE 45: face, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a
LINE 46: beauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:
LINE 47: "As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being."
LINE 48: The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side to
LINE 49: side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of
LINE 50: the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a
LINE 51: peasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of
LINE 52: them had ever beheld, or even Cardenio's if they had not seen and known
LINE 53: Luscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda
LINE 54: could compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her
LINE 55: shoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her all
LINE 56: round beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form
LINE 57: was visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had
LINE 58: seemed like bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like pieces
LINE 59: of driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only the
LINE 60: admiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she
LINE 61: was. With this object they resolved to show themselves, and at the stir
LINE 62: they made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head,
LINE 63: and parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands, she looked
LINE 64: to see who had made the noise, and the instant she perceived them she
LINE 65: started to her feet, and without waiting to put on her shoes or gather
LINE 66: up her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she
LINE 67: had beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight;
LINE 68: but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, her delicate
LINE 69: feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which,
LINE 70: the three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her first
LINE 71: said:
LINE 72: "Stay, señora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only
LINE 73: desire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so
LINE 74: heedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it."
LINE 75: Taken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words.
LINE 76: They, however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on
LINE 77: to say:
LINE 78: "What your dress would hide, señora, is made known to us by your hair;
LINE 79: a clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your
LINE 80: beauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like
LINE 81: these where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve
LINE 82: your distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long
LINE 83: as life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make
LINE 84: the sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention.
LINE 85: And so, señora, or señor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the
LINE 86: fears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with
LINE 87: your good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each
LINE 88: one of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble."
LINE 89: While the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if
LINE 90: spell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a
LINE 91: word, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has
LINE 92: never seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing
LINE 93: some further words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke
LINE 94: silence and said:
LINE 95: "Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me,
LINE 96: and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to
LINE 97: deal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further
LINE 98: pretence of what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out
LINE 99: of courtesy than for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank
LINE 100: you, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under the
LINE 101: obligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though I
LINE 102: fear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you
LINE 103: as much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest
LINE 104: anything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them. However,
LINE 105: that my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, now
LINE 106: that you have discovered me to be a woman, and see that I am young,
LINE 107: alone, and in this dress, things that taken together or separately
LINE 108: would be enough to destroy any good name, I feel bound to tell what I
LINE 109: would willingly keep secret if I could."
LINE 110: All this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without
LINE 111: any hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they
LINE 112: were not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as
LINE 113: they again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her
LINE 114: promise, she without further pressing, first modestly covering her feet
LINE 115: and gathering up her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three
LINE 116: placed around her, and, after an effort to restrain some tears that
LINE 117: came to her eyes, in a clear and steady voice began her story thus:
LINE 118: "In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title
LINE 119: which makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This
LINE 120: nobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to
LINE 121: his good qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be
LINE 122: the treachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are
LINE 123: this lord's vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had
LINE 124: conferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left
LINE 125: to desire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in
LINE 126: which I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of
LINE 127: theirs in not having been nobly born. It is true they are not so low
LINE 128: that they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition, but neither
LINE 129: are they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that my
LINE 130: mishap comes of their humble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plain
LINE 131: homely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, as the
LINE 132: saying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and
LINE 133: free-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered
LINE 134: gentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth and
LINE 135: nobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as
LINE 136: they have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionate
LINE 137: parents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents
LINE 138: indulged.
LINE 139: "I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their
LINE 140: old age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their
LINE 141: wishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew
LINE 142: their worth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of
LINE 143: their possessions. Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants;
LINE 144: through my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and
LINE 145: reaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and
LINE 146: herds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has
LINE 147: or can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress
LINE 148: with an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot
LINE 149: well describe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had given
LINE 150: the requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other
LINE 151: labourers, I passed in such employments as are not only allowable but
LINE 152: necessary for young girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion,
LINE 153: and spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted
LINE 154: them for a while, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or
LINE 155: playing the harp, for experience taught me that music soothes the
LINE 156: troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led
LINE 157: in my parents' house and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not
LINE 158: out of ostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you may
LINE 159: see how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy
LINE 160: condition I have described, to the misery I am in at present. The truth
LINE 161: is, that while I was leading this busy life, in a retirement that might
LINE 162: compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except
LINE 163: the servants of the house (for when I went to Mass it was so early in
LINE 164: the morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and the women
LINE 165: of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes
LINE 166: scarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the
LINE 167: eyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx's
LINE 168: cannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don
LINE 169: Fernando; for that is the name of the younger son of the duke I told
LINE 170: of."
LINE 171: The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio
LINE 172: changed colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that
LINE 173: the curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad
LINE 174: fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but
LINE 175: Cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the
LINE 176: peasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was.
LINE 177: She, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing
LINE 178: her story, went on to say:
LINE 179: "And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he
LINE 180: was smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it
LINE 181: displayed itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my
LINE 182: woes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don
LINE 183: Fernando for declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household,
LINE 184: he gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was
LINE 185: like a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could
LINE 186: sleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, no
LINE 187: one knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges,
LINE 188: containing more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all
LINE 189: which not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as
LINE 190: if he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me
LINE 191: yield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred
LINE 192: bearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his
LINE 193: importunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction
LINE 194: to find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction,
LINE 195: and I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters (for
LINE 196: however ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us to
LINE 197: hear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right was
LINE 198: opposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who
LINE 199: now very plainly perceived Don Fernando's purpose, for he cared very
LINE 200: little if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided
LINE 201: their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade
LINE 202: me consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I
LINE 203: might conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the
LINE 204: contrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage;
LINE 205: and if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his
LINE 206: unreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to
LINE 207: anyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or
LINE 208: of any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good
LINE 209: name, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their
LINE 210: sound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando
LINE 211: a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however
LINE 212: remote.

LINE 215: "All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had
LINE 216: apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite—for that is the
LINE 217: name I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to
LINE 218: be, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no
LINE 219: occasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were
LINE 220: contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of
LINE 221: obtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors
LINE 222: to watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as
LINE 223: you shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other
LINE 224: companion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully
LINE 225: locked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I
LINE 226: know not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion
LINE 227: and these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my
LINE 228: retirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astounded
LINE 229: me that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no
LINE 230: power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one,
LINE 231: as he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for,
LINE 232: overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began
LINE 233: to make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have
LINE 234: had the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the
LINE 235: traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his
LINE 236: sighs for his sincerity.
LINE 237: "I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases
LINE 238: such as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying
LINE 239: protestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears
LINE 240: to anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of
LINE 241: bewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself,
LINE 242: I said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed,
LINE 243: 'If, as I am now in your arms, señor, I were in the claws of a fierce
LINE 244: lion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything
LINE 245: to the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it
LINE 246: or say it, than it would be possible that what was should not have
LINE 247: been; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul
LINE 248: secured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will
LINE 249: see if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your
LINE 250: vassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should
LINE 251: have any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born
LINE 252: peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and
LINE 253: gentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth
LINE 254: will have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor
LINE 255: your sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I
LINE 256: speak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should
LINE 257: be mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being
LINE 258: preserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield
LINE 259: him what you, señor, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you
LINE 260: should suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything
LINE 261: of me.' 'If that,' said this disloyal gentleman, 'be the only scruple
LINE 262: you feel, fairest Dorothea' (for that is the name of this unhappy
LINE 263: being), 'see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from
LINE 264: which nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be
LINE 265: witnesses of this pledge.'"
LINE 266: c28d.jpg (289K)

LINE 268: When Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh
LINE 269: agitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but
LINE 270: he was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of
LINE 271: what he already all but knew, so he merely said:
LINE 272: "What! is Dorothea your name, señora? I have heard of another of the
LINE 273: same name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed;
LINE 274: by-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it
LINE 275: will excite your compassion."
LINE 276: Dorothea was struck by Cardenio's words as well as by his strange and
LINE 277: miserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to
LINE 278: tell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was
LINE 279: courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure
LINE 280: that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she
LINE 281: endured already.
LINE 282: "I would not let the occasion pass, señora," replied Cardenio, "of
LINE 283: telling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far
LINE 284: there has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to
LINE 285: know it."
LINE 286: "Be it as it may," replied Dorothea, "what happened in my story was
LINE 287: that Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it
LINE 288: as a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and
LINE 289: extravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though
LINE 290: before he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well
LINE 291: what he was doing, and think of the anger his father would feel at
LINE 292: seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him
LINE 293: not to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was not
LINE 294: enough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love
LINE 295: he bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot
LINE 296: to follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages
LINE 297: so unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to
LINE 298: afford the enjoyment they began with.
LINE 299: "All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I
LINE 300: cannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his
LINE 301: purpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself
LINE 302: about difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I
LINE 303: argued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, 'I shall
LINE 304: not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty
LINE 305: station, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more
LINE 306: likely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank.
LINE 307: Then, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well
LINE 308: avail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his
LINE 309: inclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I
LINE 310: shall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him
LINE 311: by scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use
LINE 312: force, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving
LINE 313: my innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be
LINE 314: in this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that
LINE 315: this gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?'
LINE 316: "All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment;
LINE 317: but the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears
LINE 318: he shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace,
LINE 319: which, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have
LINE 320: conquered a heart even more free and coy than mine—these were the
LINE 321: things that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to
LINE 322: my ruin. I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness
LINE 323: on earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and
LINE 324: repeated his oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to
LINE 325: the former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter
LINE 326: should he fail to keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his
LINE 327: sighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which he had never
LINE 328: allowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to be
LINE 329: one, and he became a traitor and a perjured man.
LINE 330: "The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so
LINE 331: quickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has
LINE 332: attained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of
LINE 333: pleasure. I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and
LINE 334: by the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted
LINE 335: him, gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he
LINE 336: told me, though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he
LINE 337: came, that I might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and
LINE 338: sincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring
LINE 339: off his finger and placed it upon mine. He then took his departure and
LINE 340: I was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I
LINE 341: was left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what
LINE 342: had taken place, and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur to
LINE 343: me, to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in
LINE 344: concealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as yet I was unable to make
LINE 345: up my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil. I told
LINE 346: Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he might see me on
LINE 347: other nights in the same way, until it should be his pleasure to let
LINE 348: the matter become known; but, except the following night, he came no
LINE 349: more, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in the
LINE 350: street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one;
LINE 351: although I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out
LINE 352: hunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad and
LINE 353: dreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I began to
LINE 354: doubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don
LINE 355: Fernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof
LINE 356: of her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was forced to
LINE 357: put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance,
LINE 358: not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and
LINE 359: drive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was suddenly
LINE 360: brought to an end, for the time came when all such considerations were
LINE 361: disregarded, and there was no further question of honour, when my
LINE 362: patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad. The
LINE 363: reason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don
LINE 364: Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare
LINE 365: beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though not
LINE 366: so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a
LINE 367: match; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the
LINE 368: betrothal some strange things had happened."
LINE 369: Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his
LINE 370: shoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of
LINE 371: tears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her
LINE 372: story, but went on in these words:
LINE 373: "This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck
LINE 374: with a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I
LINE 375: scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying
LINE 376: aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was
LINE 377: the victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a
LINE 378: resolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to
LINE 379: assume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father's, one of
LINE 380: the zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the
LINE 381: whole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the
LINE 382: city where I heard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for
LINE 383: my boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my
LINE 384: purpose, offered to bear me company, as he said, to the end of the
LINE 385: world. I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman's dress, and
LINE 386: some jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of
LINE 387: the night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth
LINE 388: from the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and
LINE 389: on foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my
LINE 390: eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already
LINE 391: done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what
LINE 392: conscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a
LINE 393: half, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda's
LINE 394: parents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought
LINE 395: to know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at
LINE 396: the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such
LINE 397: notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in
LINE 398: the street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando's betrothal with
LINE 399: Luscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying 'Yes,'
LINE 400: she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom
LINE 401: approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found
LINE 402: a paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she
LINE 403: could not be Don Fernando's bride, because she was already Cardenio's,
LINE 404: who, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of distinction of
LINE 405: the same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only
LINE 406: in obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper
LINE 407: made it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the
LINE 408: betrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which
LINE 409: was confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her
LINE 410: clothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had
LINE 411: befooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had
LINE 412: recovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that
LINE 413: had been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those
LINE 414: who were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don
LINE 415: Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her
LINE 416: prostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was
LINE 417: really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides
LINE 418: that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal;
LINE 419: and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had
LINE 420: quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the
LINE 421: wrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one
LINE 422: should ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the
LINE 423: city, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that
LINE 424: Luscinda was missing from her father's house and from the city, for she
LINE 425: was not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who
LINE 426: knew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my
LINE 427: hopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to
LINE 428: find him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet
LINE 429: entirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven
LINE 430: had put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him
LINE 431: to recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that as
LINE 432: a Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects.
LINE 433: All this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without
LINE 434: comfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life
LINE 435: that I now abhor.
LINE 436: "But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find
LINE 437: Don Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great
LINE 438: reward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my
LINE 439: age and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who
LINE 440: came with me had taken me away from my father's house; a thing that cut
LINE 441: me to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was
LINE 442: not enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with
LINE 443: whom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my
LINE 444: consideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with
LINE 445: my servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to
LINE 446: me, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most
LINE 447: thickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one
LINE 448: evil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the
LINE 449: beginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my
LINE 450: worthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in
LINE 451: this lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty,
LINE 452: sought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes
LINE 453: seemed to present him, and with little shame and less fear of God and
LINE 454: respect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that I
LINE 455: replied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language,
LINE 456: he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and began
LINE 457: to use violence.

LINE 460: "But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good
LINE 461: intentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little
LINE 462: exertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead
LINE 463: or alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible
LINE 464: in my terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any
LINE 465: other thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and
LINE 466: escaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders.
LINE 467: It is now I know not how many months since with this object I came
LINE 468: here, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place
LINE 469: in the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him
LINE 470: as herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have
LINE 471: now unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains were
LINE 472: unavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and
LINE 473: harboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not
LINE 474: always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipice
LINE 475: or ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion,
LINE 476: as I had in the servant's case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave him
LINE 477: and again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my
LINE 478: strength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into
LINE 479: hiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears
LINE 480: implore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and
LINE 481: strength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving
LINE 482: no trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished
LINE 483: matter for talk and scandal at home and abroad."
