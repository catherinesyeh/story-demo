LINE 3: The curate's plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the
LINE 4: contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in
LINE 5: execution. They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving
LINE 6: her in pledge a new cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a
LINE 7: beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to
LINE 8: stick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these things
LINE 9: for, and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of Don
LINE 10: Quixote, and how this disguise was intended to get him away from the
LINE 11: mountain where he then was. The landlord and landlady immediately came
LINE 12: to the conclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man and
LINE 13: master of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that had
LINE 14: passed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so
LINE 15: silent about. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style
LINE 16: that left nothing to be desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with
LINE 17: black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green
LINE 18: velvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the
LINE 19: petticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The curate
LINE 20: would not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen
LINE 21: cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip
LINE 22: of black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he
LINE 23: concealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, which
LINE 24: was broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself
LINE 25: in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber
LINE 26: mounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white,
LINE 27: for it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.
LINE 28: They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she
LINE 29: was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them
LINE 30: success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had
LINE 31: in hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck
LINE 32: the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that
LINE 33: fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself
LINE 34: that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the
LINE 35: barber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be
LINE 36: the distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire's part,
LINE 37: which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was
LINE 38: resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil
LINE 39: take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the
LINE 40: pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the
LINE 41: barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their
LINE 42: plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what
LINE 43: to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and
LINE 44: give up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. The
LINE 45: barber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction,
LINE 46: and as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where
LINE 47: Don Quixote was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his
LINE 48: beard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went
LINE 49: along telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in the
LINE 50: Sierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of the valise and
LINE 51: its contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a trifle
LINE 52: covetous.
LINE 53: The next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid the
LINE 54: broom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master,
LINE 55: and recognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that
LINE 56: they would do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver
LINE 57: his master; for they had already told him that going in this guise and
LINE 58: dressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue
LINE 59: his master from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged
LINE 60: him strictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knew
LINE 61: them, and should he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to
LINE 62: Dulcinea, to say that he had, and that, as she did not know how to
LINE 63: read, she had given an answer by word of mouth, saying that she
LINE 64: commanded him, on pain of her displeasure, to come and see her at once;
LINE 65: and it was a very important matter for himself, because in this way and
LINE 66: with what they meant to say to him they felt sure of bringing him back
LINE 67: to a better mode of life and inducing him to take immediate steps to
LINE 68: become an emperor or monarch, for there was no fear of his becoming an
LINE 69: archbishop. All this Sancho listened to and fixed it well in his
LINE 70: memory, and thanked them heartily for intending to recommend his master
LINE 71: to be an emperor instead of an archbishop, for he felt sure that in the
LINE 72: way of bestowing rewards on their squires emperors could do more than
LINE 73: archbishops-errant. He said, too, that it would be as well for him to
LINE 74: go on before them to find him, and give him his lady's answer; for that
LINE 75: perhaps might be enough to bring him away from the place without
LINE 76: putting them to all this trouble. They approved of what Sancho
LINE 77: proposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back word of
LINE 78: having found his master.
LINE 79: Sancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one
LINE 80: through which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks
LINE 81: and trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with
LINE 82: all the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the
LINE 83: hour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more
LINE 84: inviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho's return, which they
LINE 85: did. They were reposing, then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied
LINE 86: by the notes of any instrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone,
LINE 87: reached their ears, at which they were not a little astonished, as the
LINE 88: place did not seem to them likely quarters for one who sang so well;
LINE 89: for though it is often said that shepherds of rare voice are to be
LINE 90: found in the woods and fields, this is rather a flight of the poet's
LINE 91: fancy than the truth. And still more surprised were they when they
LINE 92: perceived that what they heard sung were the verses not of rustic
LINE 93: shepherds, but of the polished wits of the city; and so it proved, for
LINE 94: the verses they heard were these:
LINE 95: What makes my quest of happiness seem vain?
LINE 96: Disdain.
LINE 97: What bids me to abandon hope of ease?
LINE 98: Jealousies.
LINE 99: What holds my heart in anguish of suspense?
LINE 100: Absence.
LINE 101: If that be so, then for my grief
LINE 102: Where shall I turn to seek relief,
LINE 103: When hope on every side lies slain
LINE 104: By Absence, Jealousies, Disdain?
LINE 105: What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?
LINE 106: Love.
LINE 107: What at my glory ever looks askance?
LINE 108: Chance.
LINE 109: Whence is permission to afflict me given?
LINE 110: Heaven.
LINE 111: If that be so, I but await
LINE 112: The stroke of a resistless fate,
LINE 113: Since, working for my woe, these three,
LINE 114: Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.
LINE 115: What must I do to find a remedy?
LINE 116: Die.
LINE 117: What is the lure for love when coy and strange?
LINE 118: Change.
LINE 119: What, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?
LINE 120: Madness.
LINE 121: If that be so, it is but folly
LINE 122: To seek a cure for melancholy:
LINE 123: Ask where it lies; the answer saith
LINE 124: In Change, in Madness, or in Death.
LINE 125: The hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill of
LINE 126: the singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the two
LINE 127: listeners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding,
LINE 128: however, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved to
LINE 129: go in search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as
LINE 130: they were about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which
LINE 131: once more fell upon their ears, singing this
LINE 132: SONNET
LINE 133: When heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst go
LINE 134: Soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky,
LINE 135: And take thy seat among the saints on high,
LINE 136: It was thy will to leave on earth below
LINE 137: Thy semblance, and upon it to bestow
LINE 138: Thy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy,
LINE 139: Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye,
LINE 140: And makes its vileness bright as virtue show.
LINE 141: Friendship, return to us, or force the cheat
LINE 142: That wears it now, thy livery to restore,
LINE 143: By aid whereof sincerity is slain.
LINE 144: If thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit,
LINE 145: This earth will be the prey of strife once more,
LINE 146: As when prim√¶val discord held its reign.
LINE 147: The song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained
LINE 148: waiting attentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the
LINE 149: music had now turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to
LINE 150: find out who the unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his
LINE 151: sighs were piteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning the
LINE 152: corner of a rock they discovered a man of the same aspect and
LINE 153: appearance as Sancho had described to them when he told them the story
LINE 154: of Cardenio. He, showing no astonishment when he saw them, stood still
LINE 155: with his head bent down upon his breast like one in deep thought,
LINE 156: without raising his eyes to look at them after the first glance when
LINE 157: they suddenly came upon him. The curate, who was aware of his
LINE 158: misfortune and recognised him by the description, being a man of good
LINE 159: address, approached him and in a few sensible words entreated and urged
LINE 160: him to quit a life of such misery, lest he should end it there, which
LINE 161: would be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was then in his
LINE 162: right mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequently
LINE 163: carried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual among
LINE 164: the frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise,
LINE 165: especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a
LINE 166: well-known matter (for the curate's words gave him to understand as
LINE 167: much) so he replied to them thus:
LINE 168: "I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is
LINE 169: to succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this
LINE 170: remote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve
LINE 171: it not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some better
LINE 172: retreat, showing me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I
LINE 173: act in leading the life I do; but as they know, that if I escape from
LINE 174: this evil I shall fall into another still greater, perhaps they will
LINE 175: set me down as a weak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid of
LINE 176: reason; nor would it be any wonder, for I myself can perceive that the
LINE 177: effect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so
LINE 178: powerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like a
LINE 179: stone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel the truth
LINE 180: of it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have done
LINE 181: when the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot
LINE 182: in vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by telling
LINE 183: how it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable
LINE 184: beings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they
LINE 185: cannot help me at least they will not blame me, and the repugnance they
LINE 186: feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes. If it be, sirs,
LINE 187: that you are here with the same design as others have come with, before
LINE 188: you proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hear the story
LINE 189: of my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it you
LINE 190: will spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering
LINE 191: consolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it."
LINE 192: As they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own
LINE 193: lips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it,
LINE 194: promising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not
LINE 195: wish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly
LINE 196: the same words and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and
LINE 197: the goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don
LINE 198: Quixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale
LINE 199: was left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now
LINE 200: fortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end;
LINE 201: and so, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found
LINE 202: in the volume of "Amadis of Gaul," Cardenio said that he remembered it
LINE 203: perfectly and that it was in these words:
LINE 204: "_Luscinda to Cardenio._
LINE 205: "Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold
LINE 206: you in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this
LINE 207: obligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a
LINE 208: father who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any
LINE 209: constraint on my inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you
LINE 210: to have, if it be that you value me as you say and as I believe you
LINE 211: do."
LINE 212: "By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my
LINE 213: wife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don
LINE 214: Fernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and
LINE 215: this letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine
LINE 216: could be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda's
LINE 217: father was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I did
LINE 218: not dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;
LINE 219: not because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue,
LINE 220: and beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour
LINE 221: to any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me
LINE 222: to marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me.
LINE 223: In short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as
LINE 224: well on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged
LINE 225: me though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me
LINE 226: that what I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando
LINE 227: answered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and
LINE 228: persuade him to speak to Luscinda's father. O, ambitious Marius! O,
LINE 229: cruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous
LINE 230: Vellido! O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel,
LINE 231: vindictive, and perfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in his
LINE 232: fidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys
LINE 233: of his heart? What offence did I commit? What words did I utter, or
LINE 234: what counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy honour and
LINE 235: welfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? for
LINE 236: sure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from
LINE 237: on high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power on
LINE 238: earth can check their course nor human device stay their coming. Who
LINE 239: could have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman,
LINE 240: intelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services, one that could
LINE 241: win the object of his love wherever he might set his affections, could
LINE 242: have become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lamb
LINE 243: that was not even yet in my possession? But laying aside these useless
LINE 244: and unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread of my
LINE 245: unhappy story.
LINE 246: "To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the
LINE 247: execution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to
LINE 248: his elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for
LINE 249: six horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me
LINE 250: away that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had
LINE 251: purchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and the price
LINE 252: of which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this
LINE 253: treachery? Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from
LINE 254: that, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my
LINE 255: satisfaction at the good bargain that had been made. That night I spoke
LINE 256: with Luscinda, and told her what had been agreed upon with Don
LINE 257: Fernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes
LINE 258: being realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don
LINE 259: Fernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she believed the
LINE 260: fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father
LINE 261: put off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this to
LINE 262: me her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat that
LINE 263: prevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me
LINE 264: she was striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn,
LINE 265: which I never before observed in her, for we always conversed, whenever
LINE 266: good fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest
LINE 267: gaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or
LINE 268: fears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune
LINE 269: that Heaven should have given her to me for my mistress; I glorified
LINE 270: her beauty, I extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me
LINE 271: back by praising in me what in her love for me she thought worthy of
LINE 272: praise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our
LINE 273: neighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my
LINE 274: boldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and
LINE 275: carry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that
LINE 276: separated us allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my
LINE 277: departure she wept, she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me
LINE 278: filled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such
LINE 279: strange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to
LINE 280: dash my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and the
LINE 281: pain that separation gives those who love tenderly. At last I took my
LINE 282: departure, sad and dejected, my heart filled with fancies and
LINE 283: suspicions, but not knowing well what it was I suspected or fancied;
LINE 284: plain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting
LINE 285: me.
LINE 286: "I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don
LINE 287: Fernando's brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,
LINE 288: for he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in
LINE 289: some place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his
LINE 290: brother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all
LINE 291: of which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother
LINE 292: had no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once.
LINE 293: "The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying
LINE 294: it, as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days
LINE 295: separated from Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful
LINE 296: mood I have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I
LINE 297: obeyed, though I felt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But
LINE 298: four days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he
LINE 299: gave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as
LINE 300: the writing was hers. I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded
LINE 301: that it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to me
LINE 302: when at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. Before
LINE 303: reading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and how
LINE 304: long he had been upon the road; he told me that as he happened to be
LINE 305: passing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a
LINE 306: very beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in her
LINE 307: eyes said to him hurriedly, 'Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, a
LINE 308: Christian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter
LINE 309: despatched without a moment's delay to the place and person named in
LINE 310: the address, all which is well known, and by this you will render a
LINE 311: great service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in
LINE 312: doing so take what is in this handkerchief;' and said he, 'with this
LINE 313: she threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a
LINE 314: hundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with the
LINE 315: letter I have given you. And then without waiting for any answer she
LINE 316: left the window, though not before she saw me take the letter and the
LINE 317: handkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as she
LINE 318: bade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would
LINE 319: have in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was to
LINE 320: you it was sent (for, se√±or, I know you very well), and also unable to
LINE 321: resist that beautiful lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else,
LINE 322: but to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from the
LINE 323: time when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know,
LINE 324: is eighteen leagues.'
LINE 325: "All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this,
LINE 326: I hung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could
LINE 327: scarcely stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:
LINE 328: The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine,
LINE 329: he has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your
LINE 330: advantage. I have to tell you, se√±or, that he has demanded me for a
LINE 331: wife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando's
LINE 332: superiority over you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in two
LINE 333: days hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so
LINE 334: privately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few
LINE 335: of the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it be
LINE 336: urgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether I
LINE 337: love you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall
LINE 338: be forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he
LINE 339: has pledged.
LINE 340: "Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set
LINE 341: out at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now
LINE 342: saw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own
LINE 343: pleasure that had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The
LINE 344: exasperation I felt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of
LINE 345: losing the prize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lent
LINE 346: me wings; so that almost flying I reached home the same day, by the
LINE 347: hour which served for speaking with Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and
LINE 348: left the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy man who
LINE 349: had brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so
LINE 350: kind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of our
LINE 351: loves. She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as she ought to
LINE 352: have recognised me, or I her. But who is there in the world that can
LINE 353: boast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable
LINE 354: nature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as soon as Luscinda
LINE 355: saw me she said, 'Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and the
LINE 356: treacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me in
LINE 357: the hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my
LINE 358: death before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend,
LINE 359: but contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be
LINE 360: prevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent
LINE 361: more deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a
LINE 362: first proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.' I replied to her
LINE 363: distractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply,
LINE 364: 'May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a
LINE 365: dagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself
LINE 366: if fortune be against us.'
LINE 367: "I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that
LINE 368: they called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the
LINE 369: night of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my
LINE 370: eyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house,
LINE 371: nor was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was
LINE 372: that I should be present at what might take place on the occasion, I
LINE 373: nerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the
LINE 374: entrances and outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret
LINE 375: pervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I
LINE 376: found an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window
LINE 377: of the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two
LINE 378: tapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see all
LINE 379: that took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart
LINE 380: I suffered as I stood there‚Äîthe thoughts that came to me‚Äîthe
LINE 381: reflections that passed through my mind? They were such as cannot be,
LINE 382: nor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that the
LINE 383: bridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress, without ornament of any
LINE 384: kind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of Luscinda's and except
LINE 385: the servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber. Soon
LINE 386: afterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, attended by her
LINE 387: mother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her rank
LINE 388: and beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety and
LINE 389: distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she
LINE 390: wore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white,
LINE 391: and the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel,
LINE 392: surpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with
LINE 393: the precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the
LINE 394: hall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my
LINE 395: peace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored
LINE 396: enemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and
LINE 397: recall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may
LINE 398: seek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not
LINE 399: weary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of
LINE 400: those that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each
LINE 401: incident seems to call for many words."
LINE 402: To this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of
LINE 403: listening to him, but that the details he mentioned interested them
LINE 404: greatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the
LINE 405: same attention as the main story.
LINE 406: "To proceed, then," continued Cardenio: "all being assembled in the
LINE 407: hall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the
LINE 408: hand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, 'Will you, Se√±ora
LINE 409: Luscinda, take Se√±or Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful
LINE 410: husband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?' I thrust my head and neck
LINE 411: out from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing
LINE 412: heart set myself to listen to Luscinda's answer, awaiting in her reply
LINE 413: the sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at
LINE 414: that moment to rush forward crying aloud, 'Luscinda, Luscinda! have a
LINE 415: care what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art
LINE 416: mine and canst not be another's; reflect that thy utterance of "Yes"
LINE 417: and the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherous
LINE 418: Don Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?
LINE 419: Remember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy
LINE 420: wishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!' Fool that I
LINE 421: am! now that I am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have done
LINE 422: what I did not do: now that I have allowed my precious treasure to be
LINE 423: robbed from me, I curse the robber, on whom I might have taken
LINE 424: vengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for bewailing my fate;
LINE 425: in short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little wonder is it if I
LINE 426: am now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.
LINE 427: "The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long
LINE 428: time withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger
LINE 429: to save her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of
LINE 430: the truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, 'I
LINE 431: will:' Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood
LINE 432: linked by a knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then
LINE 433: approached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her
LINE 434: heart, fell fainting in her mother's arms. It only remains now for me
LINE 435: to tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw
LINE 436: all my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved
LINE 437: falsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost
LINE 438: rendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it
LINE 439: seemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the
LINE 440: air refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears;
LINE 441: it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame
LINE 442: glowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion by
LINE 443: Luscinda's fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air
LINE 444: a sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized at
LINE 445: once and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as
LINE 446: he had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his
LINE 447: hand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in
LINE 448: the efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting
LINE 449: fit.
LINE 450: "Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out
LINE 451: regardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do
LINE 452: some frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous
LINE 453: indignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don
LINE 454: Fernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress. But my
LINE 455: fate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so
LINE 456: ordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason
LINE 457: which has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to take
LINE 458: vengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken,
LINE 459: as all thought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to take
LINE 460: it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved,
LINE 461: perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to them
LINE 462: had I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is
LINE 463: protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word,
LINE 464: I quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my
LINE 465: mule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him
LINE 466: farewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to
LINE 467: turn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the
LINE 468: open country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by the
LINE 469: stillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of
LINE 470: being heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in
LINE 471: maledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge
LINE 472: the wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false,
LINE 473: thankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had
LINE 474: blinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer it
LINE 475: to one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, in
LINE 476: the midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found
LINE 477: excuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the
LINE 478: seclusion of her parents' house, trained and schooled to obey them
LINE 479: always, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they
LINE 480: offered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and
LINE 481: noble birth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have been
LINE 482: thought out of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, a
LINE 483: suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said,
LINE 484: had she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that in
LINE 485: choosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her,
LINE 486: for before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could not
LINE 487: have desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more
LINE 488: eligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking
LINE 489: the last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I
LINE 490: had already given her mine, for I should have come forward to support
LINE 491: any assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the
LINE 492: conclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a
LINE 493: craving for rank, had made her forget the words with which she had
LINE 494: deceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable
LINE 495: passion.
LINE 496: "Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder
LINE 497: of the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these
LINE 498: mountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking
LINE 499: any path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not
LINE 500: which side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in
LINE 501: what direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that
LINE 502: it was in this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither,
LINE 503: intending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these
LINE 504: crags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think
LINE 505: more likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it
LINE 506: bore in me. I was left on foot, worn out, famishing, without anyone to
LINE 507: help me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus I lay stretched on
LINE 508: the ground, how long I know not, after which I rose up free from
LINE 509: hunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were the
LINE 510: persons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they had
LINE 511: found me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I had
LINE 512: lost my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always in
LINE 513: full possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do a
LINE 514: thousand mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in these
LINE 515: solitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the dear name of her
LINE 516: who is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and
LINE 517: when I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and weary that I
LINE 518: can scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork
LINE 519: tree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and
LINE 520: goatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish me
LINE 521: with food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think
LINE 522: I may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out
LINE 523: of my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain
LINE 524: me, and make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they
LINE 525: tell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the
LINE 526: road, and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force
LINE 527: from the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do
LINE 528: pass the wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven's will to
LINE 529: bring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer
LINE 530: recollect the beauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by
LINE 531: Don Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, I
LINE 532: will turn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only
LINE 533: implore it to have full mercy on my soul, for in myself I feel no power
LINE 534: or strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of my
LINE 535: own accord chosen to place it.
LINE 536: "Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one
LINE 537: that can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not
LINE 538: trouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests
LINE 539: as likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the
LINE 540: medicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will
LINE 541: not take it. I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it
LINE 542: is her pleasure to be another's, when she is or should be mine, let it
LINE 543: be mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She
LINE 544: by her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive
LINE 545: to gratify her wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show
LINE 546: generations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which all
LINE 547: others in misfortune have a superabundance, for to them the
LINE 548: impossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation, while to me it
LINE 549: is the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings, for I think that even
LINE 550: in death there will not be an end of them."
LINE 551: Here Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full
LINE 552: of misfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to
LINE 553: address some words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that
LINE 554: reached his ear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the
LINE 555: Fourth Part of this narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious
LINE 556: historian, Cid Hamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.
