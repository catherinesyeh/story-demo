LINE 3: The sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took
LINE 4: leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of
LINE 5: Chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had
LINE 6: seen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more
LINE 7: than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,
LINE 8: they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which
LINE 9: ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass
LINE 10: there the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning
LINE 11: to come on oppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning
LINE 12: Rocinante and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in
LINE 13: abundance, they ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very
LINE 14: peacefully and sociably master and man made their repast on what they
LINE 15: found in them.

LINE 18: Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling
LINE 19: sure, from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence,
LINE 20: that all the mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an
LINE 21: impropriety. Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep,
LINE 22: so ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of
LINE 23: Galician ponies belonging to certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it
LINE 24: is to take their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where
LINE 25: grass and water abound; and that where Don Quixote chanced to be suited
LINE 26: the Yanguesans' purpose very well. It so happened, then, that Rocinante
LINE 27: took a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and
LINE 28: abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without
LINE 29: asking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened
LINE 30: to make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred
LINE 31: their pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth to
LINE 32: such effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without
LINE 33: a saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that
LINE 34: the carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came
LINE 35: running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought
LINE 36: him sorely battered to the ground.
LINE 37: By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of
LINE 38: Rocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:
LINE 39: "So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base
LINE 40: folk of low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in
LINE 41: taking due vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our
LINE 42: eyes."
LINE 43: "What the devil vengeance can we take," answered Sancho, "if they are
LINE 44: more than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more
LINE 45: than one and a half?"
LINE 46: "I count for a hundred," replied Don Quixote, and without more words he
LINE 47: drew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by
LINE 48: the example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don
LINE 49: Quixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather
LINE 50: jerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The
LINE 51: Yanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were
LINE 52: so many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into
LINE 53: the middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at
LINE 54: the second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote
LINE 55: fared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing,
LINE 56: and fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who
LINE 57: had not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can
LINE 58: pound in angry boorish hands.

LINE 61: Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the
LINE 62: haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving
LINE 63: the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.
LINE 64: Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his
LINE 65: master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, "Señor Don
LINE 66: Quixote, ah, Señor Don Quixote!"
LINE 67: "What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?" answered Don Quixote in the same
LINE 68: feeble suffering tone as Sancho.
LINE 69: "I would like, if it were possible," answered Sancho Panza, "your
LINE 70: worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas,
LINE 71: if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for
LINE 72: broken bones as well as for wounds."
LINE 73: "If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?"
LINE 74: said Don Quixote; "but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a
LINE 75: knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise,
LINE 76: I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its
LINE 77: cunning."
LINE 78: "But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our
LINE 79: feet?" answered Sancho Panza.
LINE 80: "For myself I must say I cannot guess how many," said the battered
LINE 81: knight Don Quixote; "but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no
LINE 82: business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights
LINE 83: like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having
LINE 84: transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this
LINE 85: chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother
LINE 86: Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I
LINE 87: am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the
LINE 88: welfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabble of this
LINE 89: sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against
LINE 90: them, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise
LINE 91: them to thy heart's content, and if any knights come to their aid and
LINE 92: defence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my
LINE 93: might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what
LINE 94: the might of this strong arm of mine is equal to"—so uplifted had the
LINE 95: poor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.
LINE 96: But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as to
LINE 97: let it pass without saying in reply, "Señor, I am a man of peace, meek
LINE 98: and quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and
LINE 99: children to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your
LINE 100: worship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw
LINE 101: sword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God
LINE 102: I forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have
LINE 103: been, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble
LINE 104: or commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever."
LINE 105: To all which his master said in reply, "I wish I had breath enough to
LINE 106: speak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would
LINE 107: abate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.
LINE 108: Come now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse,
LINE 109: should turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that
LINE 110: safely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those
LINE 111: islands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning
LINE 112: it I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible
LINE 113: through not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor
LINE 114: possessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy
LINE 115: lordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and
LINE 116: provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well
LINE 117: disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some
LINE 118: move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance may
LINE 119: do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good
LINE 120: sense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself,
LINE 121: whatever may befall him."
LINE 122: "In what has now befallen us," answered Sancho, "I'd have been well
LINE 123: pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,
LINE 124: but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than
LINE 125: for arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help
LINE 126: Rocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of
LINE 127: all this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to
LINE 128: be a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right
LINE 129: that it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is
LINE 130: nothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty
LINE 131: slashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was
LINE 132: coming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a great
LINE 133: storm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?"
LINE 134: "And yet thine, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "ought to be used to such
LINE 135: squalls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain
LINE 136: they must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not
LINE 137: that I imagine—why do I say imagine?—know of a certainty that all these
LINE 138: annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I
LINE 139: would lay me down here to die of pure vexation."
LINE 140: To this the squire replied, "Señor, as these mishaps are what one reaps
LINE 141: of chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their
LINE 142: own fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after
LINE 143: two harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his
LINE 144: infinite mercy helps us."
LINE 145: "Know, friend Sancho," answered Don Quixote, "that the life of
LINE 146: knights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and
LINE 147: neither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for
LINE 148: knights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in
LINE 149: the case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly
LINE 150: acquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of
LINE 151: some who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have
LINE 152: mentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers
LINE 153: misfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself
LINE 154: in the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is
LINE 155: positively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two
LINE 156: hundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the
LINE 157: pillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of
LINE 158: no small authority who says that the Knight of Phœbus, being caught in
LINE 159: a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on
LINE 160: falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,
LINE 161: where they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,
LINE 162: of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not
LINE 163: been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his,
LINE 164: it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well suffer
LINE 165: in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities
LINE 166: which they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have
LINE 167: thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen
LINE 168: by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in
LINE 169: the law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler
LINE 170: strikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in
LINE 171: fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he
LINE 172: struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst
LINE 173: imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have
LINE 174: therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with
LINE 175: which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one
LINE 176: of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger."
LINE 177: "They gave me no time to see that much," answered Sancho, "for hardly
LINE 178: had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders
LINE 179: with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes
LINE 180: and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and
LINE 181: where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or
LINE 182: not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they
LINE 183: will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders."
LINE 184: "For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza," said Don Quixote, "that
LINE 185: there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain
LINE 186: which death does not remove."
LINE 187: "And what greater misfortune can there be," replied Panza, "than the
LINE 188: one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If
LINE 189: our mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,
LINE 190: it would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the
LINE 191: plasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right."
LINE 192: "No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to
LINE 193: do," returned Don Quixote, "and let us see how Rocinante is, for it
LINE 194: seems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the
LINE 195: lot of the poor beast."
LINE 196: "There is nothing wonderful in that," replied Sancho, "since he is a
LINE 197: knight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come
LINE 198: off scot-free where we come out scotched."
LINE 199: "Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring
LINE 200: relief to it," said Don Quixote; "I say so because this little beast
LINE 201: may now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle
LINE 202: where I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any
LINE 203: dishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old
LINE 204: Silenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he
LINE 205: entered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on
LINE 206: a handsome ass."
LINE 207: "It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says," answered
LINE 208: Sancho, "but there is a great difference between going mounted and
LINE 209: going slung like a sack of manure."
LINE 210: To which Don Quixote replied, "Wounds received in battle confer honour
LINE 211: instead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I
LINE 212: told thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy
LINE 213: beast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere
LINE 214: night come on and surprise us in these wilds."
LINE 215: "And yet I have heard your worship say," observed Panza, "that it is
LINE 216: very meet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that
LINE 217: they esteem it very good fortune."
LINE 218: "That is," said Don Quixote, "when they cannot help it, or when they
LINE 219: are in love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have
LINE 220: remained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the
LINE 221: inclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it;
LINE 222: and one of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he
LINE 223: took up his abode on the Peña Pobre for—I know not if it was eight
LINE 224: years or eight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any
LINE 225: rate he stayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the
LINE 226: Princess Oriana had against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and
LINE 227: make haste before a mishap like Rocinante's befalls the ass."
LINE 228: "The very devil would be in it in that case," said Sancho; and letting
LINE 229: off thirty "ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty
LINE 230: maledictions and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him
LINE 231: there, he raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow
LINE 232: without power to bring himself upright, but with all his pains he
LINE 233: saddled his ass, who too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the
LINE 234: excessive licence of the day; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for
LINE 235: him, had he possessed a tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither
LINE 236: Sancho nor his master would have been behind him.

LINE 239: To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante
LINE 240: with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded
LINE 241: more or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road
LINE 242: might be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from
LINE 243: good to better, he had not gone a short league when the road came in
LINE 244: sight, and on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the
LINE 245: delight of Don Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it
LINE 246: was an inn, and his master that it was not one, but a castle, and the
LINE 247: dispute lasted so long that before the point was settled they had time
LINE 248: to reach it, and into it Sancho entered with all his team without any
LINE 249: further controversy.
