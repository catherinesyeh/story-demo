LINE 3: Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of
LINE 4: having recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage
LINE 5: in his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and
LINE 6: the Marquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the
LINE 7: mountainside, a story known by heart by the children, not forgotten by
LINE 8: the young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for
LINE 9: all that not a whit truer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to
LINE 10: him to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a
LINE 11: show of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with
LINE 12: feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the
LINE 13: wood is said to have uttered:
LINE 14: Where art thou, lady mine, that thou
LINE 15: My sorrow dost not rue?
LINE 16: Thou canst not know it, lady mine,
LINE 17: Or else thou art untrue.
LINE 18: And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:
LINE 19: O noble Marquis of Mantua,
LINE 20: My Uncle and liege lord!

LINE 23: As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to
LINE 24: come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had
LINE 25: been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched
LINE 26: there, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter
LINE 27: with him that he complained so dolefully.
LINE 28: Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua,
LINE 29: his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in
LINE 30: which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the
LINE 31: Emperor's son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.
LINE 32: The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of
LINE 33: the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face,
LINE 34: which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he
LINE 35: recognised him and said, "Señor Quixada" (for so he appears to have
LINE 36: been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a
LINE 37: quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), "who has brought your
LINE 38: worship to this pass?" But to all questions the other only went on with
LINE 39: his ballad.
LINE 40: Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate
LINE 41: and backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no
LINE 42: blood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the
LINE 43: ground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which
LINE 44: seemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms,
LINE 45: even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and
LINE 46: leading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road
LINE 47: for the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was
LINE 48: talking.

LINE 51: Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could
LINE 52: not sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to
LINE 53: heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him.
LINE 54: And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head
LINE 55: tales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he
LINE 56: bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of
LINE 57: Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away
LINE 58: to his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and
LINE 59: what ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that
LINE 60: the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read
LINE 61: the story in the "Diana" of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written,
LINE 62: applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went along
LINE 63: cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from
LINE 64: which, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad,
LINE 65: and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness
LINE 66: of this harangue of Don Quixote's; who, at the end of it, said, "Señor
LINE 67: Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I
LINE 68: have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have
LINE 69: done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in
LINE 70: this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen."
LINE 71: To this the peasant answered, "Señor—sinner that I am!—cannot your
LINE 72: worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of
LINE 73: Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is
LINE 74: neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Señor
LINE 75: Quixada?"
LINE 76: "I know who I am," replied Don Quixote, "and I know that I may be not
LINE 77: only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even
LINE 78: all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have
LINE 79: done all together and each of them on his own account."
LINE 80: With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just
LINE 81: as night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a
LINE 82: little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in
LINE 83: such a miserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time
LINE 84: he entered the village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he found
LINE 85: all in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who
LINE 86: were great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to
LINE 87: them in a loud voice, "What does your worship think can have befallen
LINE 88: my master, Señor Licentiate Pero Perez?" for so the curate was called;
LINE 89: "it is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack,
LINE 90: or the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and
LINE 91: it is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of
LINE 92: chivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,
LINE 93: have upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying
LINE 94: to himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world
LINE 95: in quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that
LINE 96: have brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in
LINE 97: all La Mancha!"
LINE 98: The niece said the same, and, more: "You must know, Master
LINE 99: Nicholas"—for that was the name of the barber—"it was often my uncle's
LINE 100: way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books
LINE 101: of misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up
LINE 102: his sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he
LINE 103: would say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat
LINE 104: that flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the
LINE 105: wounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug
LINE 106: of cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a
LINE 107: most precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician and
LINE 108: friend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myself
LINE 109: for never having told your worships of my uncle's vagaries, that you
LINE 110: might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn
LINE 111: all these accursed books—for he has a great number—that richly deserve
LINE 112: to be burned like heretics."
LINE 113: "So say I too," said the curate, "and by my faith to-morrow shall not
LINE 114: pass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to
LINE 115: the flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend
LINE 116: seems to have behaved."
LINE 117: All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was
LINE 118: the matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, "Open, your
LINE 119: worships, to Señor Baldwin and to Señor the Marquis of Mantua, who
LINE 120: comes badly wounded, and to Señor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the
LINE 121: valiant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive."
LINE 122: At these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their
LINE 123: friend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass
LINE 124: because he could not, they ran to embrace him.
LINE 125: "Hold!" said he, "for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault;
LINE 126: carry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and
LINE 127: see to my wounds."
LINE 128: "See there! plague on it!" cried the housekeeper at this: "did not my
LINE 129: heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed
LINE 130: with your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here
LINE 131: without fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred
LINE 132: times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship
LINE 133: to such a pass."
LINE 134: They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds
LINE 135: could find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a
LINE 136: severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants,
LINE 137: the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.
LINE 138: "So, so!" said the curate, "are there giants in the dance? By the sign
LINE 139: of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over."
LINE 140: They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all
LINE 141: was—give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was
LINE 142: what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant
LINE 143: at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and
LINE 144: the nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which
LINE 145: made the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day,
LINE 146: which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with
LINE 147: him to Don Quixote's house.
