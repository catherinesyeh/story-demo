LINE 3: My family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and
LINE 4: nature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in
LINE 5: the general poverty of those communities my father passed for being
LINE 6: even a rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as
LINE 7: clever in preserving his property as he was in spending it. This
LINE 8: tendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having
LINE 9: been a soldier in his youth, for the soldier's life is a school in
LINE 10: which the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and
LINE 11: if any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of
LINE 12: rare occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered on
LINE 13: prodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man
LINE 14: who has children to succeed to his name and position. My father had
LINE 15: three, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make choice of a
LINE 16: profession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist his propensity,
LINE 17: he resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of his
LINE 18: prodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without which
LINE 19: Alexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us all
LINE 20: three aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat to
LINE 21: the following effect:
LINE 22: "My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said
LINE 23: than that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not
LINE 24: love you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no
LINE 25: self-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned;
LINE 26: therefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a
LINE 27: father, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do
LINE 28: with you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature
LINE 29: deliberation decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line of
LINE 30: life or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour
LINE 31: and profit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is to
LINE 32: divide my property into four parts; three I will give to you, to each
LINE 33: his portion without making any difference, and the other I will retain
LINE 34: to live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life Heaven
LINE 35: may be pleased to grant me. But I wish each of you on taking possession
LINE 36: of the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall
LINE 37: indicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind very
LINE 38: true—as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long practical
LINE 39: experience—and the one I refer to says, 'The church, or the sea, or the
LINE 40: king's house;' as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants to
LINE 41: flourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or go to sea,
LINE 42: adopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king's service in his
LINE 43: household, for they say, 'Better a king's crumb than a lord's favour.'
LINE 44: I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should
LINE 45: follow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in the
LINE 46: wars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in
LINE 47: his household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great
LINE 48: distinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full shares
LINE 49: in money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the
LINE 50: end. Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as
LINE 51: I have laid it before you."
LINE 52: Having called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him not
LINE 53: to strip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased, for
LINE 54: we were young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with his
LINE 55: wishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms and
LINE 56: thereby serve God and my king. My second brother having made the same
LINE 57: proposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion that
LINE 58: fell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, said
LINE 59: he would rather follow the church, or go to complete his studies at
LINE 60: Salamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choice
LINE 61: of our professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time he
LINE 62: mentioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he had
LINE 63: given to each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousand
LINE 64: ducats apiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid
LINE 65: for it down, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on the
LINE 66: same day took leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it
LINE 67: seemed to me inhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his
LINE 68: old age, I induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats, as the
LINE 69: remainder would be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed. My
LINE 70: two brothers, moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so
LINE 71: that there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money,
LINE 72: besides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell to him which
LINE 73: he preferred to retain in land instead of selling it. Finally, as I
LINE 74: said, we took leave of him, and of our uncle whom I have mentioned, not
LINE 75: without sorrow and tears on both sides, they charging us to let them
LINE 76: know whenever an opportunity offered how we fared, whether well or ill.
LINE 77: We promised to do so, and when he had embraced us and given us his
LINE 78: blessing, one set out for Salamanca, the other for Seville, and I for
LINE 79: Alicante, where I had heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in a
LINE 80: cargo of wool for Genoa.
LINE 81: It is now some twenty-two years since I left my father's house, and all
LINE 82: that time, though I have written several letters, I have had no news
LINE 83: whatever of him or of my brothers; my own adventures during that period
LINE 84: I will now relate briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after
LINE 85: a prosperous voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided
LINE 86: myself with arms and a few soldier's accoutrements; thence it was my
LINE 87: intention to go and take service in Piedmont, but as I was already on
LINE 88: the road to Alessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of
LINE 89: Alva was on his way to Flanders. I changed my plans, joined him, served
LINE 90: under him in the campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of the
LINE 91: Counts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous
LINE 92: captain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my
LINE 93: arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius
LINE 94: V. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common
LINE 95: enemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous
LINE 96: island of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable
LINE 97: and disastrous. It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of
LINE 98: Austria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming as
LINE 99: commander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of the
LINE 100: vast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred my
LINE 101: heart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which
LINE 102: was expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certain
LINE 103: promises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should
LINE 104: be promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake myself,
LINE 105: as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just
LINE 106: arrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian
LINE 107: fleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I
LINE 108: took part in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a
LINE 109: captain of infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck rather
LINE 110: than my merits raised me; and that day—so fortunate for Christendom,
LINE 111: because then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the error
LINE 112: under which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea—on
LINE 113: that day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken,
LINE 114: among all that were there made happy (for the Christians who died that
LINE 115: day were happier than those who remained alive and victorious) I alone
LINE 116: was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might have
LINE 117: expected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that
LINE 118: famous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my
LINE 119: hands.
LINE 120: It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and
LINE 121: successful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese
LINE 122: galley (only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly
LINE 123: wounded), the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my
LINE 124: company were placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do
LINE 125: in such a case, I leaped on board the enemy's galley, which, sheering
LINE 126: off from that which had attacked it, prevented my men from following
LINE 127: me, and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in
LINE 128: such numbers that I was unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered
LINE 129: with wounds; El Uchali, as you know, sirs, made his escape with his
LINE 130: entire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in his power, the only sad
LINE 131: being among so many filled with joy, and the only captive among so many
LINE 132: free; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in the
LINE 133: Turkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that day.
LINE 134: They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my
LINE 135: master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and
LINE 136: carried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of
LINE 137: Malta. The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found
LINE 138: myself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three
LINE 139: lanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the
LINE 140: whole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and
LINE 141: janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be
LINE 142: attacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or
LINE 143: shoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed,
LINE 144: in so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it
LINE 145: otherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on
LINE 146: our side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God's
LINE 147: will and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment
LINE 148: to chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an
LINE 149: island near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of the
LINE 150: harbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On this expedition
LINE 151: was taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of the
LINE 152: famous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galley
LINE 153: called the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that father
LINE 154: of his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don Álvaro de
LINE 155: Bazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what took
LINE 156: place at the capture of the Prize.
LINE 157: The son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,
LINE 158: that, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was
LINE 159: bearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped
LINE 160: their oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end
LINE 161: of the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from
LINE 162: bench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before
LINE 163: he had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so
LINE 164: great, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and the
LINE 165: hatred with which they hated him.
LINE 166: We returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three,
LINE 167: it became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom
LINE 168: from the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to
LINE 169: the hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the
LINE 170: world, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the
LINE 171: loss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess,
LINE 172: he made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than
LINE 173: he was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta
LINE 174: and the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all
LINE 175: these events were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any
LINE 176: hope of freedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for
LINE 177: I was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my
LINE 178: misfortunes. At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before
LINE 179: which places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers,
LINE 180: and more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of
LINE 181: Africa, and in the train of all this great host such munitions and
LINE 182: engines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they might
LINE 183: have covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The first
LINE 184: to fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell,
LINE 185: not by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and
LINE 186: should have done, but because experiment proved how easily
LINE 187: entrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to
LINE 188: be found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards;
LINE 189: and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so
LINE 190: high that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as if
LINE 191: from a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain
LINE 192: the defence.
LINE 193: It was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up
LINE 194: in the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the
LINE 195: landing-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little
LINE 196: knowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there
LINE 197: were barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number,
LINE 198: however resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers like
LINE 199: those of the enemy? And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold
LINE 200: that is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined
LINE 201: enemies in their own country? But many thought, and I thought so too,
LINE 202: that it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain in
LINE 203: permitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief,
LINE 204: that devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wasted
LINE 205: there to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture by
LINE 206: the invincible Charles V.; as if to make that eternal, as it is and
LINE 207: will be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell;
LINE 208: but the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended
LINE 209: it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed
LINE 210: in twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of three
LINE 211: hundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and
LINE 212: manifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they
LINE 213: had defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or tower
LINE 214: which was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan
LINE 215: Zanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon
LINE 216: terms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the
LINE 217: Goletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and took
LINE 218: the loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to
LINE 219: Constantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also took
LINE 220: the commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese
LINE 221: gentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two
LINE 222: fortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,
LINE 223: knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was
LINE 224: shown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea
LINE 225: Doria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by
LINE 226: some Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted
LINE 227: himself, and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to
LINE 228: Tabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese
LINE 229: employed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried
LINE 230: it to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth
LINE 231: of our Castilian proverb, that "though the treason may please, the
LINE 232: traitor is hated;" for they say he ordered those who brought him the
LINE 233: present to be hanged for not having brought him alive.

LINE 236: Among the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro
LINE 237: de Aguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who
LINE 238: had been ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare
LINE 239: intelligence, who had in particular a special gift for what they call
LINE 240: poetry. I say so because his fate brought him to my galley and to my
LINE 241: bench, and made him a slave to the same master; and before we left the
LINE 242: port this gentleman composed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on the
LINE 243: Goletta and the other on the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them,
LINE 244: for I have them by heart, and I think they will be liked rather than
LINE 245: disliked.
LINE 246: The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don
LINE 247: Fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when
LINE 248: he came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, "Before your worship
LINE 249: proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don
LINE 250: Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of."
LINE 251: "All I know is," replied the captive, "that after having been in
LINE 252: Constantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in
LINE 253: company with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I
LINE 254: cannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the
LINE 255: Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result
LINE 256: of the journey was."
LINE 257: "Well then, you are right," returned the gentleman, "for that Don Pedro
LINE 258: is my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich,
LINE 259: married, and with three children."
LINE 260: "Thanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him," said the
LINE 261: captive; "for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with
LINE 262: recovering lost liberty."
LINE 263: "And what is more," said the gentleman, "I know the sonnets my brother
LINE 264: made."
LINE 265: "Then let your worship repeat them," said the captive, "for you will
LINE 266: recite them better than I can."
LINE 267: "With all my heart," said the gentleman; "that on the Goletta runs
LINE 268: thus."
