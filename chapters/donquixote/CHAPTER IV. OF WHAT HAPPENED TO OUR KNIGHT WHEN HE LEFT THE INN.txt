LINE 3: Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so
LINE 4: exhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was
LINE 5: like to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his
LINE 6: host as to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that
LINE 7: referring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide
LINE 8: himself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing
LINE 9: a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very
LINE 10: well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object
LINE 11: he turned his horse's head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus
LINE 12: reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly
LINE 13: seemed to tread the earth.
LINE 14: He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to
LINE 15: come feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heard
LINE 16: them he exclaimed, "Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,
LINE 17: that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I
LINE 18: have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries,
LINE 19: no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my
LINE 20: aid and protection;" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction
LINE 21: whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into
LINE 22: the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and
LINE 23: stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,
LINE 24: from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty
LINE 25: farmer was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with
LINE 26: scoldings and commands, repeating, "Your mouth shut and your eyes
LINE 27: open!" while the youth made answer, "I won't do it again, master mine;
LINE 28: by God's passion I won't do it again, and I'll take more care of the
LINE 29: flock another time."
LINE 30: Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,
LINE 31: "Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot
LINE 32: defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance" (for there was a
LINE 33: lance leaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), "and I will
LINE 34: make you know that you are behaving as a coward." The farmer, seeing
LINE 35: before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his
LINE 36: head, gave himself up for dead, and made answer meekly, "Sir Knight,
LINE 37: this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch
LINE 38: a flock of sheep that I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose
LINE 39: one every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and knavery
LINE 40: he says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I
LINE 41: owe him, and before God, and on my soul, he lies."
LINE 42: "Lies before me, base clown!" said Don Quixote. "By the sun that shines
LINE 43: on us I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at once
LINE 44: without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an
LINE 45: end of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly."

LINE 48: The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of
LINE 49: whom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.
LINE 50: He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it
LINE 51: up, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay
LINE 52: it down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.
LINE 53: The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had
LINE 54: sworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were
LINE 55: to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given
LINE 56: him, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.
LINE 57: "All that is very well," said Don Quixote; "but let the shoes and the
LINE 58: blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him
LINE 59: without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid
LINE 60: for, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood
LINE 61: from him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on
LINE 62: that score he owes you nothing."
LINE 63: "The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres
LINE 64: come home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real."
LINE 65: "I go with him!" said the youth. "Nay, God forbid! No, señor, not for
LINE 66: the world; for once alone with me, he would flay me like a Saint
LINE 67: Bartholomew."
LINE 68: "He will do nothing of the kind," said Don Quixote; "I have only to
LINE 69: command, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of
LINE 70: knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the
LINE 71: payment."
LINE 72: "Consider what you are saying, señor," said the youth; "this master of
LINE 73: mine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for
LINE 74: he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar."
LINE 75: "That matters little," replied Don Quixote; "there may be Haldudos
LINE 76: knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works."
LINE 77: "That is true," said Andres; "but this master of mine—of what works is
LINE 78: he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?"
LINE 79: "I do not refuse, brother Andres," said the farmer, "be good enough to
LINE 80: come along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there
LINE 81: are in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and
LINE 82: perfumed."
LINE 83: "For the perfumery I excuse you," said Don Quixote; "give it to him in
LINE 84: reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;
LINE 85: if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and
LINE 86: punish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a
LINE 87: lizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you,
LINE 88: that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous
LINE 89: Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so,
LINE 90: God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn
LINE 91: under those penalties that have been already declared to you."
LINE 92: So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The
LINE 93: farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared
LINE 94: the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and
LINE 95: said, "Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that
LINE 96: undoer of wrongs has commanded me."
LINE 97: "My oath on it," said Andres, "your worship will be well advised to
LINE 98: obey the command of that good knight—may he live a thousand years—for,
LINE 99: as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he
LINE 100: will come back and do as he said."
LINE 101: "My oath on it, too," said the farmer; "but as I have a strong
LINE 102: affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the
LINE 103: payment;" and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave
LINE 104: him such a flogging that he left him for dead.
LINE 105: "Now, Master Andres," said the farmer, "call on the undoer of wrongs;
LINE 106: you will find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have
LINE 107: quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive." But at
LINE 108: last he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in
LINE 109: order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.
LINE 110: Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look
LINE 111: for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had
LINE 112: happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for
LINE 113: all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.
LINE 114: Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly
LINE 115: satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a
LINE 116: very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road
LINE 117: towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice,
LINE 118: "Well mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O
LINE 119: Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy
LINE 120: lot to hold subject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a
LINE 121: knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as
LINE 122: all the world knows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and
LINE 123: hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that ever
LINE 124: injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked
LINE 125: the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing
LINE 126: that tender child."
LINE 127: He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he
LINE 128: was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to
LINE 129: consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted
LINE 130: for a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante
LINE 131: his head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out
LINE 132: his first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable.
LINE 133: After he had gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party
LINE 134: of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on
LINE 135: their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along
LINE 136: under their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers
LINE 137: on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy
LINE 138: possessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him to
LINE 139: imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books,
LINE 140: here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt.
LINE 141: So with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly in
LINE 142: his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his
LINE 143: breast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting
LINE 144: the approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered and
LINE 145: held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he
LINE 146: exclaimed with a haughty gesture, "All the world stand, unless all the
LINE 147: world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the
LINE 148: Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso."
LINE 149: The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the
LINE 150: strange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at
LINE 151: once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn
LINE 152: quietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of
LINE 153: them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very
LINE 154: sharp-witted, said to him, "Sir Knight, we do not know who this good
LINE 155: lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such
LINE 156: beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we
LINE 157: will confess the truth that is on your part required of us."
LINE 158: "If I were to show her to you," replied Don Quixote, "what merit would
LINE 159: you have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that
LINE 160: without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend
LINE 161: it; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant
LINE 162: rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of
LINE 163: knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of
LINE 164: your breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the
LINE 165: cause I maintain."
LINE 166: "Sir Knight," replied the trader, "I entreat your worship in the name
LINE 167: of this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our
LINE 168: consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard
LINE 169: of, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and
LINE 170: Queens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to
LINE 171: show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain
LINE 172: of wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we
LINE 173: shall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay,
LINE 174: I believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though her
LINE 175: portrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and
LINE 176: sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship,
LINE 177: say all in her favour that you desire."
LINE 178: "She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble," said Don Quixote,
LINE 179: burning with rage, "nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and
LINE 180: civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than
LINE 181: a Guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered
LINE 182: against beauty like that of my lady."
LINE 183: And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had
LINE 184: spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived
LINE 185: that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone
LINE 186: hard with the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his
LINE 187: master, rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried
LINE 188: to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs,
LINE 189: helmet, and the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was
LINE 190: struggling to get up he kept saying, "Fly not, cowards and caitiffs!
LINE 191: stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, am I stretched here."

LINE 194: One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good
LINE 195: nature in him, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style,
LINE 196: was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming
LINE 197: up to him he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one
LINE 198: of them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding
LINE 199: and in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His
LINE 200: masters called out not to lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but
LINE 201: the muleteer's blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game until
LINE 202: he had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining
LINE 203: fragments of the lance he finished with a discharge upon the unhappy
LINE 204: victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him never
LINE 205: ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they
LINE 206: seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders
LINE 207: continued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about the
LINE 208: poor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when he found himself alone made
LINE 209: another effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how
LINE 210: was he to rise after having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to
LINE 211: pieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed to him that
LINE 212: this was a regular knight-errant's mishap, and entirely, he considered,
LINE 213: the fault of his horse. However, battered in body as he was, to rise
LINE 214: was beyond his power.
