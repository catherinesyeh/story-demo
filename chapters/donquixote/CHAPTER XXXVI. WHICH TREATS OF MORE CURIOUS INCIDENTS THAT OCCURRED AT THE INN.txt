LINE 3: Just at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of the
LINE 4: inn, exclaimed, "Here comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop here
LINE 5: we may say _gaudeamus_."
LINE 6: "What are they?" said Cardenio.
LINE 7: "Four men," said the landlord, "riding _à la jineta_, with lances and
LINE 8: bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman in
LINE 9: white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants
LINE 10: on foot."
LINE 11: "Are they very near?" said the curate.
LINE 12: "So near," answered the landlord, "that here they come."
LINE 13: Hearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into Don
LINE 14: Quixote's room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole
LINE 15: party the host had described entered the inn, and the four that were on
LINE 16: horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, and
LINE 17: came forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and
LINE 18: one of them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood at
LINE 19: the entrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All this
LINE 20: time neither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word,
LINE 21: only on sitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let
LINE 22: her arms fall like one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot
LINE 23: then led the horses away to the stable. Observing this the curate,
LINE 24: curious to know who these people in such a dress and preserving such
LINE 25: silence were, went to where the servants were standing and put the
LINE 26: question to one of them, who answered him.
LINE 27: "Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to
LINE 28: be people of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady
LINE 29: you saw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him
LINE 30: respect, and nothing is done except what he directs and orders."
LINE 31: "And the lady, who is she?" asked the curate.
LINE 32: "That I cannot tell you either," said the servant, "for I have not seen
LINE 33: her face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and utter
LINE 34: such groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it
LINE 35: is no wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my
LINE 36: comrade and I have only been in their company two days, for having met
LINE 37: us on the road they begged and persuaded us to accompany them to
LINE 38: Andalusia, promising to pay us well."
LINE 39: "And have you heard any of them called by his name?" asked the curate.
LINE 40: "No, indeed," replied the servant; "they all preserve a marvellous
LINE 41: silence on the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except
LINE 42: the poor lady's sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel
LINE 43: sure that wherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as
LINE 44: far as one can judge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more
LINE 45: likely, about to become one; and perhaps it is because taking the vows
LINE 46: is not of her own free will, that she is so unhappy as she seems to
LINE 47: be."
LINE 48: "That may well be," said the curate, and leaving them he returned to
LINE 49: where Dorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by natural
LINE 50: compassion drew near to her and said, "What are you suffering from,
LINE 51: señora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how to
LINE 52: relieve, I offer you my services with all my heart."
LINE 53: To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated
LINE 54: her offers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman
LINE 55: with the veil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest,
LINE 56: approached and said to Dorothea, "Do not give yourself the trouble,
LINE 57: señora, of making any offers to that woman, for it is her way to give
LINE 58: no thanks for anything that is done for her; and do not try to make her
LINE 59: answer unless you want to hear some lie from her lips."
LINE 60: "I have never told a lie," was the immediate reply of her who had been
LINE 61: silent until now; "on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and
LINE 62: so ignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition;
LINE 63: and this I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth
LINE 64: that has made you false and a liar."
LINE 65: Cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close to
LINE 66: the speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote's room between
LINE 67: them, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,
LINE 68: "Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached my
LINE 69: ears?" Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing
LINE 70: the speaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing
LINE 71: which the gentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step.
LINE 72: In her agitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had
LINE 73: covered her face fell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable
LINE 74: and marvellous beauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her
LINE 75: eyes, everywhere she could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made
LINE 76: her look as if she had lost her senses, and so marked that it excited
LINE 77: the pity of Dorothea and all who beheld her, though they knew not what
LINE 78: caused it. The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being
LINE 79: so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to
LINE 80: his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and
LINE 81: Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw
LINE 82: that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The
LINE 83: instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from
LINE 84: the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the
LINE 85: barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen
LINE 86: completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her
LINE 87: face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it
LINE 88: was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if
LINE 89: death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of
LINE 90: Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from
LINE 91: his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised
LINE 92: her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea's cry as she fell fainting, and
LINE 93: imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the
LINE 94: room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his
LINE 95: arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three,
LINE 96: Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely
LINE 97: knowing what had happened to them.
LINE 98: They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando,
LINE 99: Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at
LINE 100: Cardenio. The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed
LINE 101: Don Fernando: "Leave me, Señor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you
LINE 102: owe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling
LINE 103: to the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neither
LINE 104: your importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts
LINE 105: have been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden
LINE 106: from our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; and
LINE 107: well you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able
LINE 108: to efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead
LINE 109: you, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your
LINE 110: affection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up
LINE 111: in the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may
LINE 112: be by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the
LINE 113: last moment of life."
LINE 114: Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words,
LINE 115: by means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando
LINE 116: did not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as
LINE 117: well as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of
LINE 118: bright and touching tears addressed him thus:
LINE 119: "If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine
LINE 120: arms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen
LINE 121: by this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt
LINE 122: have it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly
LINE 123: peasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst
LINE 124: raise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion
LINE 125: of innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy
LINE 126: importunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she opened
LINE 127: the gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her
LINE 128: liberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown
LINE 129: by my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thy
LINE 130: appearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I
LINE 131: would not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame;
LINE 132: it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that
LINE 133: have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow
LINE 134: thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help
LINE 135: being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear
LINE 136: thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou
LINE 137: wouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou
LINE 138: art mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio's; and it will
LINE 139: be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than
LINE 140: to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address
LINE 141: thyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert
LINE 142: not ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to
LINE 143: thy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and
LINE 144: if it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a
LINE 145: gentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy
LINE 146: at last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I
LINE 147: am, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,
LINE 148: for so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do
LINE 149: not by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the
LINE 150: streets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal
LINE 151: services they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not
LINE 152: deserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy
LINE 153: blood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no
LINE 154: nobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in
LINE 155: illustrious lineages it is not the woman's blood that is of account;
LINE 156: and, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art
LINE 157: wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I
LINE 158: have higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, señor, these
LINE 159: are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy
LINE 160: wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if
LINE 161: thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me;
LINE 162: witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which
LINE 163: thou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and
LINE 164: if all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its
LINE 165: silent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of
LINE 166: what I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment."
LINE 167: All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest
LINE 168: feeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don
LINE 169: Fernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened
LINE 170: to her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such
LINE 171: sobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not
LINE 172: softened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her
LINE 173: with no less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her
LINE 174: intelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words
LINE 175: of comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held
LINE 176: her fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after
LINE 177: regarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms,
LINE 178: and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:
LINE 179: "Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is
LINE 180: impossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many
LINE 181: truths."
LINE 182: Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground
LINE 183: when Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having
LINE 184: retreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside
LINE 185: and regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and
LINE 186: said as he clasped her in his arms, "If Heaven in its compassion is
LINE 187: willing to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant,
LINE 188: and fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that
LINE 189: now receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to
LINE 190: call thee mine."
LINE 191: At these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to
LINE 192: recognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that
LINE 193: it was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all
LINE 194: considerations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and
LINE 195: pressing her face close to his, said, "Yes, my dear lord, you are the
LINE 196: true master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose
LINE 197: again, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours."
LINE 198: A strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,
LINE 199: filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied
LINE 200: that Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take
LINE 201: vengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;
LINE 202: and the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she
LINE 203: clasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to
LINE 204: prevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, "What
LINE 205: is it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou
LINE 206: hast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife
LINE 207: is in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for
LINE 208: thee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has
LINE 209: done, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be
LINE 210: thy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and
LINE 211: constancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the
LINE 212: face and bosom of her lawful husband. For God's sake I entreat of thee,
LINE 213: for thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy
LINE 214: anger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in
LINE 215: peace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven
LINE 216: permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy
LINE 217: lofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason has
LINE 218: more influence than passion."
LINE 219: All the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda
LINE 220: in his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he
LINE 221: saw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist
LINE 222: as best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him
LINE 223: his life. But now Don Fernando's friends, as well as the curate and the
LINE 224: barber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy
LINE 225: Sancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating
LINE 226: him to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her
LINE 227: reasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed,
LINE 228: what she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was
LINE 229: not, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of
LINE 230: Providence that they had all met in a place where no one could have
LINE 231: expected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death
LINE 232: could part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were to
LINE 233: separate them they would think their death most happy; and that in a
LINE 234: case that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conquering
LINE 235: and putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of
LINE 236: his own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had
LINE 237: granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of
LINE 238: Dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excel
LINE 239: her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the
LINE 240: surpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him
LINE 241: that if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he
LINE 242: could not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing
LINE 243: so he would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who
LINE 244: know and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of
LINE 245: humble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself
LINE 246: to the level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon
LINE 247: an equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of
LINE 248: passion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he
LINE 249: is not to be blamed who gives way to it.
LINE 250: To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don
LINE 251: Fernando's manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was
LINE 252: touched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he
LINE 253: could not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the
LINE 254: good advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and
LINE 255: embracing Dorothea, saying to her, "Rise, dear lady, it is not right
LINE 256: that what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if
LINE 257: until now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by
LINE 258: Heaven's decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love
LINE 259: me, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is
LINE 260: that you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous
LINE 261: wrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you
LINE 262: mine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this,
LINE 263: turn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see
LINE 264: in them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained
LINE 265: the object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all
LINE 266: my wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy years
LINE 267: with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live
LINE 268: with my Dorothea;" and with these words he once more embraced her and
LINE 269: pressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to take
LINE 270: great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and
LINE 271: repentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and
LINE 272: almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own
LINE 273: happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a
LINE 274: heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping;
LINE 275: though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was
LINE 276: not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great
LINE 277: favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and
LINE 278: then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don
LINE 279: Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in
LINE 280: language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising
LINE 281: them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy.
LINE 282: He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far
LINE 283: removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that
LINE 284: she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his
LINE 285: companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been
LINE 286: longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she
LINE 287: had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city
LINE 288: after he had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared
LINE 289: that she was Cardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant
LINE 290: to kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her
LINE 291: parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and
LINE 292: resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should
LINE 293: offer. The next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her
LINE 294: father's house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone.
LINE 295: Finally, at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a
LINE 296: convent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she were
LINE 297: not to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this,
LINE 298: taking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place
LINE 299: where she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were
LINE 300: known he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent;
LINE 301: and watching a time when the porter's lodge was open he left two to
LINE 302: guard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest of
LINE 303: Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of
LINE 304: the nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they
LINE 305: reached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they
LINE 306: required for taking her away; all which they were able to do in
LINE 307: complete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable
LINE 308: distance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in
LINE 309: his power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself
LINE 310: did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in
LINE 311: silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching
LINE 312: heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.
