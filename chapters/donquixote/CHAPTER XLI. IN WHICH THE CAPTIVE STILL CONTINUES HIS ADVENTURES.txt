LINE 3: Before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an
LINE 4: excellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make
LINE 5: the transaction safe and lend a colour to it, he thought it well to
LINE 6: make, as he did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leagues
LINE 7: from Algiers on the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade in
LINE 8: dried figs. Two or three times he made this voyage in company with the
LINE 9: Tagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins in
LINE 10: Barbary, and those of Granada Mudéjares; but in the Kingdom of Fez they
LINE 11: call the Mudéjares Elches, and they are the people the king chiefly
LINE 12: employs in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he
LINE 13: anchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden
LINE 14: where Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with the
LINE 15: two Moorish lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, either
LINE 16: going through his prayers, or else practising as a part what he meant
LINE 17: to perform in earnest. And thus he would go to Zoraida's garden and ask
LINE 18: for fruit, which her father gave him, not knowing him; but though, as
LINE 19: he afterwards told me, he sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her who
LINE 20: he was, and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of the
LINE 21: Christians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had never
LINE 22: been able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be
LINE 23: seen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with
LINE 24: Christian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and
LINE 25: communication, even more than might be considered proper. But for my
LINE 26: part I should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it
LINE 27: might have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. But
LINE 28: God, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our
LINE 29: renegade's well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how safely he could go to
LINE 30: Shershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he liked, and
LINE 31: that the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I was
LINE 32: ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to
LINE 33: look out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above
LINE 34: those who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday,
LINE 35: which he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelve
LINE 36: Spaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the
LINE 37: city; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because
LINE 38: there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the
LINE 39: rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that
LINE 40: their master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order
LINE 41: to finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said
LINE 42: nothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come
LINE 43: out stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting
LINE 44: for me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately,
LINE 45: with orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not
LINE 46: to say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that
LINE 47: spot.
LINE 48: This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step
LINE 49: had to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that
LINE 50: she might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise
LINE 51: if we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the
LINE 52: Christians' vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, to go
LINE 53: to the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before my
LINE 54: departure I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The first
LINE 55: person I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that all
LINE 56: over Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives
LINE 57: and Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other
LINE 58: nation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all
LINE 59: understand one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me
LINE 60: what I wanted in his garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I
LINE 61: was a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew as a certainty that he was a
LINE 62: very great friend of his), and that I wanted some herbs to make a
LINE 63: salad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what my
LINE 64: master demanded for me. While these questions and answers were
LINE 65: proceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time
LINE 66: before, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are
LINE 67: by no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians,
LINE 68: or, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming
LINE 69: to where her father stood with me; moreover her father, seeing her
LINE 70: approaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be beyond my power
LINE 71: now to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, the
LINE 72: brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself before
LINE 73: my eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from
LINE 74: her fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head.
LINE 75: On her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for
LINE 76: so bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set
LINE 77: with so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued
LINE 78: them at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were
LINE 79: worth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the
LINE 80: highest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking
LINE 81: themselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are
LINE 82: therefore more among the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida's
LINE 83: father had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and the
LINE 84: purest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred
LINE 85: thousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was
LINE 86: mistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been
LINE 87: beautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be
LINE 88: imagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for,
LINE 89: as everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its
LINE 90: seasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally
LINE 91: the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more
LINE 92: frequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herself
LINE 93: before me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely
LINE 94: beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I
LINE 95: had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt
LINE 96: as though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me
LINE 97: relief and happiness.
LINE 98: As she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a
LINE 99: captive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come
LINE 100: for salad.
LINE 101: She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have
LINE 102: spoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not
LINE 103: ransomed.
LINE 104: I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might
LINE 105: be seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand
LINE 106: five hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, "Hadst thou been my
LINE 107: father's, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for
LINE 108: twice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and
LINE 109: make yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors."
LINE 110: "That may be, lady," said I; "but indeed I dealt truthfully with my
LINE 111: master, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world."
LINE 112: "And when dost thou go?" said Zoraida.
LINE 113: "To-morrow, I think," said I, "for there is a vessel here from France
LINE 114: which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her."
LINE 115: "Would it not be better," said Zoraida, "to wait for the arrival of
LINE 116: ships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not
LINE 117: your friends?"
LINE 118: "No," said I; "though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now
LINE 119: coming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it
LINE 120: is more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to
LINE 121: return to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not
LINE 122: allow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if
LINE 123: it be delayed."
LINE 124: "No doubt thou art married in thine own country," said Zoraida, "and
LINE 125: for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife."
LINE 126: "I am not married," I replied, "but I have given my promise to marry on
LINE 127: my arrival there."
LINE 128: "And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?" said Zoraida.
LINE 129: "So beautiful," said I, "that, to describe her worthily and tell thee
LINE 130: the truth, she is very like thee."
LINE 131: At this her father laughed very heartily and said, "By Allah,
LINE 132: Christian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who
LINE 133: is the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well
LINE 134: and thou wilt see I am telling the truth."
LINE 135: Zoraida's father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of
LINE 136: these words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language,
LINE 137: that, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more
LINE 138: by signs than by words.
LINE 139: While we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running
LINE 140: up, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the
LINE 141: garden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The
LINE 142: old man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to
LINE 143: speak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the
LINE 144: soldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are
LINE 145: under their power that they treat them worse than if they were their
LINE 146: slaves. Her father said to Zoraida, "Daughter, retire into the house
LINE 147: and shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou,
LINE 148: Christian, pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe
LINE 149: to thy own country."
LINE 150: I bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with
LINE 151: Zoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade
LINE 152: her; but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden,
LINE 153: turning to me with her eyes full of tears she said, "Tameji, cristiano,
LINE 154: tameji?" that is to say, "Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?"
LINE 155: I made answer, "Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on
LINE 156: the watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest
LINE 157: us; for most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians."
LINE 158: This I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed
LINE 159: between us, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble
LINE 160: steps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it (and it
LINE 161: might have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered
LINE 162: it), just as we were moving on in the manner and position I have
LINE 163: described, with her arm round my neck, her father, as he returned after
LINE 164: having sent away the Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceived
LINE 165: that he saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not to
LINE 166: remove her arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closer to me and
LINE 167: laid her head on my breast, bending her knees a little and showing all
LINE 168: the signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem
LINE 169: as though I were supporting her against my will. Her father came
LINE 170: running up to where we were, and seeing his daughter in this state
LINE 171: asked what was the matter with her; she, however, giving no answer, he
LINE 172: said, "No doubt she has fainted in alarm at the entrance of those
LINE 173: dogs," and taking her from mine he drew her to his own breast, while
LINE 174: she sighing, her eyes still wet with tears, said again, "Ameji,
LINE 175: cristiano, ameji"—"Go, Christian, go." To this her father replied,
LINE 176: "There is no need, daughter, for the Christian to go, for he has done
LINE 177: thee no harm, and the Turks have now gone; feel no alarm, there is
LINE 178: nothing to hurt thee, for as I say, the Turks at my request have gone
LINE 179: back the way they came."

LINE 182: "It was they who terrified her, as thou hast said, señor," said I to
LINE 183: her father; "but since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displease
LINE 184: her: peace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this
LINE 185: garden for herbs if need be, for my master says there are nowhere
LINE 186: better herbs for salad than here."
LINE 187: "Come back for any thou hast need of," replied Hadji Morato; "for my
LINE 188: daughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or any
LINE 189: Christian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that
LINE 190: it was time for thee to look for thy herbs."
LINE 191: With this I at once took my leave of both; and she, looking as though
LINE 192: her heart were breaking, retired with her father. While pretending to
LINE 193: look for herbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studied
LINE 194: carefully all the approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of the
LINE 195: house and everything that could be taken advantage of to make our task
LINE 196: easy.

LINE 199: Having done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken place
LINE 200: to the renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience to
LINE 201: the hour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possession
LINE 202: of the prize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely
LINE 203: Zoraida. The time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed
LINE 204: for arrived; and, all following out the arrangement and plan which,
LINE 205: after careful consideration and many a long discussion, we had decided
LINE 206: upon, we succeeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday
LINE 207: following the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the
LINE 208: renegade anchored his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot
LINE 209: where she was. The Christians who were to row were ready and in hiding
LINE 210: in different places round about, all waiting for me, anxious and
LINE 211: elated, and eager to attack the vessel they had before their eyes; for
LINE 212: they did not know the renegade's plan, but expected that they were to
LINE 213: gain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who were
LINE 214: on board the vessel. As soon, then, as I and my comrades made our
LINE 215: appearance, all those that were in hiding seeing us came and joined us.
LINE 216: It was now the time when the city gates are shut, and there was no one
LINE 217: to be seen in all the space outside. When we were collected together we
LINE 218: debated whether it would be better first to go for Zoraida, or to make
LINE 219: prisoners of the Moorish rowers who rowed in the vessel; but while we
LINE 220: were still uncertain our renegade came up asking us what kept us, as it
LINE 221: was now the time, and all the Moors were off their guard and most of
LINE 222: them asleep. We told him why we hesitated, but he said it was of more
LINE 223: importance first to secure the vessel, which could be done with the
LINE 224: greatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for Zoraida.
LINE 225: We all approved of what he said, and so without further delay, guided
LINE 226: by him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board first, drew his
LINE 227: cutlass and said in Morisco, "Let no one stir from this if he does not
LINE 228: want it to cost him his life." By this almost all the Christians were
LINE 229: on board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captain
LINE 230: speak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking to
LINE 231: his arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted without
LINE 232: saying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured them,
LINE 233: threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they would be
LINE 234: all put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of our
LINE 235: party being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking
LINE 236: the renegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato's garden, and
LINE 237: as good luck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as
LINE 238: if it had not been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we
LINE 239: reached the house without being perceived by anybody. The lovely
LINE 240: Zoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived
LINE 241: that there were people there, she asked in a low voice if we were
LINE 242: "Nizarani," as much as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answered
LINE 243: that we were, and begged her to come down. As soon as she recognised me
LINE 244: she did not delay an instant, but without answering a word came down
LINE 245: immediately, opened the door and presented herself before us all, so
LINE 246: beautiful and so richly attired that I cannot attempt to describe her.
LINE 247: The moment I saw her I took her hand and kissed it, and the renegade
LINE 248: and my two comrades did the same; and the rest, who knew nothing of the
LINE 249: circumstances, did as they saw us do, for it only seemed as if we were
LINE 250: returning thanks to her, and recognising her as the giver of our
LINE 251: liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco language if her father
LINE 252: was in the house. She replied that he was and that he was asleep.
LINE 253: "Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us," said the
LINE 254: renegade, "and everything of value in this fair mansion."
LINE 255: "Nay," said she, "my father must not on any account be touched, and
LINE 256: there is nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will
LINE 257: be quite enough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you
LINE 258: shall see," and so saying she went in, telling us she would return
LINE 259: immediately and bidding us keep quiet without making any noise.
LINE 260: I asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me,
LINE 261: I declared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the
LINE 262: wishes of Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of
LINE 263: gold crowns that she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father
LINE 264: awoke while this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came
LINE 265: to the window, and at once perceiving that all those who were there
LINE 266: were Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call
LINE 267: out in Arabic, "Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!" by which
LINE 268: cries we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but
LINE 269: the renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was for
LINE 270: him to effect his purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost
LINE 271: quickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of our
LINE 272: party; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost
LINE 273: fainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so
LINE 274: promptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with
LINE 275: his hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented him
LINE 276: from uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt to
LINE 277: speak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught sight of him
LINE 278: she covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father was
LINE 279: horror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had placed herself in
LINE 280: our hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on the move, and
LINE 281: carefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who had
LINE 282: remained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishap
LINE 283: having befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when we
LINE 284: were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the
LINE 285: hands of Zoraida's father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the
LINE 286: renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his
LINE 287: life. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and
LINE 288: still more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that
LINE 289: she lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any
LINE 290: reluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into
LINE 291: effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.
LINE 292: Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with
LINE 293: the oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound,
LINE 294: bade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors
LINE 295: and setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself
LINE 296: in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be
LINE 297: carried away captive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade
LINE 298: repeated this to me, and I replied that I was very willing to do so;
LINE 299: but he replied that it was not advisable, because if they were left
LINE 300: there they would at once raise the country and stir up the city, and
LINE 301: lead to the despatch of swift cruisers in pursuit, and our being taken,
LINE 302: by sea or land, without any possibility of escape; and that all that
LINE 303: could be done was to set them free on the first Christian ground we
LINE 304: reached. On this point we all agreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was
LINE 305: explained, together with the reasons that prevented us from doing at
LINE 306: once what she desired, was satisfied likewise; and then in glad silence
LINE 307: and with cheerful alacrity each of our stout rowers took his oar, and
LINE 308: commending ourselves to God with all our hearts, we began to shape our
LINE 309: course for the island of Majorca, the nearest Christian land. Owing,
LINE 310: however, to the Tramontana rising a little, and the sea growing
LINE 311: somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep a straight course for
LINE 312: Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in the direction of Oran, not
LINE 313: without great uneasiness on our part lest we should be observed from
LINE 314: the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not more than sixty
LINE 315: miles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on that course
LINE 316: one of the galliots that usually come with goods from Tetuan; although
LINE 317: each of us for himself and all of us together felt confident that, if
LINE 318: we were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were not a cruiser, not
LINE 319: only should we not be lost, but that we should take a vessel in which
LINE 320: we could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we pursued our course
LINE 321: Zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her father, and
LINE 322: I felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us.
LINE 323: c41d.jpg (266K)
LINE 324: Full Size
LINE 325: We might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some three
LINE 326: musket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without
LINE 327: anyone to see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a
LINE 328: little to sea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about
LINE 329: two leagues the word was given to row by batches, while we ate
LINE 330: something, for the vessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was
LINE 331: not a time to take any rest; let food be served out to those who were
LINE 332: not rowing, but they would not leave their oars on any account. This
LINE 333: was done, but now a stiff breeze began to blow, which obliged us to
LINE 334: leave off rowing and make sail at once and steer for Oran, as it was
LINE 335: impossible to make any other course. All this was done very promptly,
LINE 336: and under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear,
LINE 337: except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition. We
LINE 338: gave the Moorish rowers some food, and the renegade comforted them by
LINE 339: telling them that they were not held as captives, as we should set them
LINE 340: free on the first opportunity.
LINE 341: The same was said to Zoraida's father, who replied, "Anything else,
LINE 342: Christian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and
LINE 343: good behaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will
LINE 344: give me my liberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the
LINE 345: danger of depriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously,
LINE 346: especially as you know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive
LINE 347: on restoring it; and if you will only name that, I here offer you all
LINE 348: you require for myself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for
LINE 349: her alone, for she is the greatest and most precious part of my soul."
LINE 350: As he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all with
LINE 351: compassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw him
LINE 352: weeping she was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw
LINE 353: her arms round him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way to
LINE 354: such an outburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep
LINE 355: them company.
LINE 356: But when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels about
LINE 357: her, he said to her in his own language, "What means this, my daughter?
LINE 358: Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged
LINE 359: befell us, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now,
LINE 360: without having had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee
LINE 361: any joyful tidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking
LINE 362: thyself, I see thee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my
LINE 363: power to give thee when fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this;
LINE 364: for it causes me greater anxiety and surprise than even this misfortune
LINE 365: itself."
LINE 366: The renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his daughter; she,
LINE 367: however, returned him no answer. But when he observed in one corner of
LINE 368: the vessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, which
LINE 369: he well knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden,
LINE 370: he was still more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come into
LINE 371: our hands, and what there was in it. To which the renegade, without
LINE 372: waiting for Zoraida to reply, made answer, "Do not trouble thyself by
LINE 373: asking thy daughter Zoraida so many questions, señor, for the one
LINE 374: answer I will give thee will serve for all; I would have thee know that
LINE 375: she is a Christian, and that it is she who has been the file for our
LINE 376: chains and our deliverer from captivity. She is here of her own free
LINE 377: will, as glad, I imagine, to find herself in this position as he who
LINE 378: escapes from darkness into the light, from death to life, and from
LINE 379: suffering to glory."
LINE 380: "Daughter, is this true, what he says?" cried the Moor.
LINE 381: "It is," replied Zoraida.
LINE 382: "That thou art in truth a Christian," said the old man, "and that thou
LINE 383: hast given thy father into the power of his enemies?"
LINE 384: To which Zoraida made answer, "A Christian I am, but it is not I who
LINE 385: have placed thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave
LINE 386: thee or do thee harm, but only to do good to myself."
LINE 387: "And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?" said he.
LINE 388: "Ask thou that," said she, "of Lela Marien, for she can tell thee
LINE 389: better than I."
LINE 390: The Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness he
LINE 391: flung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would have
LINE 392: been drowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a
LINE 393: little on the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save
LINE 394: him, and we all hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew
LINE 395: him in half drowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such
LINE 396: distress that she wept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he
LINE 397: were already dead. We turned him upon his face and he voided a great
LINE 398: quantity of water, and at the end of two hours came to himself.
LINE 399: Meanwhile, the wind having changed we were compelled to head for the
LINE 400: land, and ply our oars to avoid being driven on shore; but it was our
LINE 401: good fortune to reach a creek that lies on one side of a small
LINE 402: promontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the "Cava rumia," which
LINE 403: in our language means "the wicked Christian woman;" for it is a
LINE 404: tradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain was lost, lies
LINE 405: buried at that spot; "cava" in their language meaning "wicked woman,"
LINE 406: and "rumia" "Christian;" moreover, they count it unlucky to anchor
LINE 407: there when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. For
LINE 408: us, however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a
LINE 409: haven of safety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up. We
LINE 410: posted a look-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands,
LINE 411: and ate of the stores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and Our
LINE 412: Lady with all our hearts to help and protect us, that we might give a
LINE 413: happy ending to a beginning so prosperous. At the entreaty of Zoraida
LINE 414: orders were given to set on shore her father and the other Moors who
LINE 415: were still bound, for she could not endure, nor could her tender heart
LINE 416: bear to see her father in bonds and her fellow-countrymen prisoners
LINE 417: before her eyes. We promised her to do this at the moment of departure,
LINE 418: for as it was uninhabited we ran no risk in releasing them at that
LINE 419: place.
LINE 420: Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for
LINE 421: after a while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm,
LINE 422: inviting us once more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeing
LINE 423: this we unbound the Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which
LINE 424: they were filled with amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida's
LINE 425: father, who had now completely recovered his senses, he said:
LINE 426: "Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced at
LINE 427: your giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the affection she
LINE 428: bears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presence
LINE 429: offers to the execution of her base designs. And think not that it is
LINE 430: her belief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change
LINE 431: her religion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more
LINE 432: freely practised in your country than in ours." Then turning to
LINE 433: Zoraida, while I and another of the Christians held him fast by both
LINE 434: arms, lest he should do some mad act, he said to her, "Infamous girl,
LINE 435: misguided maiden, whither in thy blindness and madness art thou going
LINE 436: in the hands of these dogs, our natural enemies? Cursed be the hour
LINE 437: when I begot thee! Cursed the luxury and indulgence in which I reared
LINE 438: thee!"
LINE 439: But seeing that he was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put him
LINE 440: on shore, and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations
LINE 441: aloud; calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound
LINE 442: us, to make an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail,
LINE 443: we could no longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how he
LINE 444: plucked out his beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground.
LINE 445: But once he raised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear
LINE 446: what he said. "Come back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive
LINE 447: thee all; let those men have the money, for it is theirs now, and come
LINE 448: back to comfort thy sorrowing father, who will yield up his life on
LINE 449: this barren strand if thou dost leave him."
LINE 450: c41e.jpg (281K)
LINE 451: Full Size
LINE 452: All this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she
LINE 453: could say in answer was, "Allah grant that Lela Marien, who has made me
LINE 454: become a Christian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father. Allah
LINE 455: knows that I could not do otherwise than I have done, and that these
LINE 456: Christians owe nothing to my will; for even had I wished not to
LINE 457: accompany them, but remain at home, it would have been impossible for
LINE 458: me, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this
LINE 459: purpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, it
LINE 460: seems wicked."
LINE 461: But neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said
LINE 462: this; and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our
LINE 463: voyage, in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we
LINE 464: made sure of finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by
LINE 465: daybreak. But, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without
LINE 466: being attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock
LINE 467: to it, our fortune, or perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at
LINE 468: his daughter (for whatever kind of father they may come from these are
LINE 469: always to be dreaded), brought it about that when we were now in
LINE 470: mid-sea, and the night about three hours spent, as we were running with
LINE 471: all sail set and oars lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us the
LINE 472: trouble of using them, we saw by the light of the moon, which shone
LINE 473: brilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail close to us, luffing
LINE 474: up and standing across our course, and so close that we had to strike
LINE 475: sail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put the helm hard up
LINE 476: to let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were,
LINE 477: whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in
LINE 478: French our renegade said, "Let no one answer, for no doubt these are
LINE 479: French corsairs who plunder all comers."
LINE 480: c41f.jpg (268K)
LINE 481: Full Size
LINE 482: Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a
LINE 483: little ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they
LINE 484: fired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with
LINE 485: one they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail
LINE 486: into the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball
LINE 487: into our vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing
LINE 488: any further damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to
LINE 489: shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were
LINE 490: beginning to fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as
LINE 491: many as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their
LINE 492: matches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we
LINE 493: were, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us
LINE 494: that this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an
LINE 495: answer. Our renegade took the trunk containing Zoraida's wealth and
LINE 496: dropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did. In short
LINE 497: we went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all
LINE 498: they wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as if
LINE 499: they had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even
LINE 500: the anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did
LINE 501: not distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her of
LINE 502: her rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most
LINE 503: precious jewel that she valued more than all. The desires, however, of
LINE 504: those people do not go beyond money, but of that their covetousness is
LINE 505: insatiable, and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that
LINE 506: they would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they had
LINE 507: been worth anything to them. It was the advice of some of them to throw
LINE 508: us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their purpose was to
LINE 509: trade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves out as Bretons,
LINE 510: and if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as the
LINE 511: robbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the one who had
LINE 512: plundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the prize he
LINE 513: had got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass the
LINE 514: Straits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for La
LINE 515: Rochelle, from which he had sailed. So they agreed by common consent to
LINE 516: give us the skiff belonging to their ship and all we required for the
LINE 517: short voyage that remained to us, and this they did the next day on
LINE 518: coming in sight of the Spanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt,
LINE 519: all our sufferings and miseries were as completely forgotten as if they
LINE 520: had never been endured by us, such is the delight of recovering lost
LINE 521: liberty.
LINE 522: It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving
LINE 523: us two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know
LINE 524: not what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave
LINE 525: her some forty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from
LINE 526: her those same garments which she has on now. We got into the boat,
LINE 527: returning them thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves
LINE 528: grateful rather than indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the
LINE 529: straits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we had before
LINE 530: us, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so
LINE 531: near that we might easily, we thought, land before the night was far
LINE 532: advanced. But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky was
LINE 533: clouded, and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us
LINE 534: a prudent thing to make for the shore, as several of us advised, saying
LINE 535: we ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from
LINE 536: any habitation, for in this way we should be relieved from the
LINE 537: apprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the Tetuan
LINE 538: corsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall and are on the Spanish coast
LINE 539: by daybreak, where they commonly take some prize, and then go home to
LINE 540: sleep in their own houses. But of the conflicting counsels the one
LINE 541: which was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and land where
LINE 542: we could if the sea were calm enough to permit us. This was done, and a
LINE 543: little before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofty
LINE 544: mountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on
LINE 545: which to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the sand, and all
LINE 546: sprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction
LINE 547: returned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to us
LINE 548: on our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions it contained, and
LINE 549: drew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the mountain,
LINE 550: for even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuade
LINE 551: ourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.
LINE 552: The dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we
LINE 553: completed the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation
LINE 554: or any shepherds' huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we
LINE 555: might, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we
LINE 556: perceive. However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not
LINE 557: but be that ere long we must see someone who could tell us where we
LINE 558: were. But what distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over
LINE 559: that rough ground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she
LINE 560: was more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she
LINE 561: would never again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very
LINE 562: patiently and cheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone
LINE 563: rather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell
LINE 564: fell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and
LINE 565: looking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed a
LINE 566: young shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his
LINE 567: knife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising his
LINE 568: head, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the
LINE 569: first who presented themselves to his sight were the renegade and
LINE 570: Zoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he imagined that all the
LINE 571: Moors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with marvellous swiftness
LINE 572: into the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a prodigious
LINE 573: outcry, exclaiming, "The Moors—the Moors have landed! To arms, to
LINE 574: arms!" We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowing
LINE 575: what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise
LINE 576: the country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to see
LINE 577: what was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his
LINE 578: Turkish garments and put on a captive's jacket or coat which one of our
LINE 579: party gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and
LINE 580: so commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw
LINE 581: the shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be
LINE 582: down upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not
LINE 583: passed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we
LINE 584: perceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a
LINE 585: hand-gallop. As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for them;
LINE 586: but as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest of,
LINE 587: saw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of them
LINE 588: asked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having
LINE 589: raised the call to arms. I said "Yes," and as I was about to explain to
LINE 590: him what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of the
LINE 591: Christians of our party recognised the horseman who had put the
LINE 592: question to us, and before I could say anything more he exclaimed:
LINE 593: "Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if
LINE 594: I do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga
LINE 595: unless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to
LINE 596: recollect that you, señor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante,
LINE 597: my uncle."
LINE 598: The Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman
LINE 599: threw himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:
LINE 600: "Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I
LINE 601: mourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin
LINE 602: that are still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that
LINE 603: they may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that
LINE 604: thou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and those
LINE 605: of all this company, I conclude that ye have had a miraculous
LINE 606: restoration to liberty."
LINE 607: "It is true," replied the young man, "and by-and-by we will tell you
LINE 608: all."
LINE 609: As soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives,
LINE 610: they dismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to
LINE 611: the city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some
LINE 612: of them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where
LINE 613: we had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed
LINE 614: on the horse of the young man's uncle. The whole town came out to meet
LINE 615: us, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had
LINE 616: gone on in advance. They were not astonished to see liberated captives
LINE 617: or captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both
LINE 618: one and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida,
LINE 619: which was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling
LINE 620: as by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all
LINE 621: fear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face,
LINE 622: that unless my affection for her were deceiving me, I would venture to
LINE 623: say that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world—at least,
LINE 624: that I had ever seen. We went straight to the church to return thanks
LINE 625: to God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she
LINE 626: said there were faces there like Lela Marien's. We told her they were
LINE 627: her images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her what
LINE 628: they meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the very
LINE 629: same Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having great
LINE 630: intelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he
LINE 631: said to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us all
LINE 632: in different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and
LINE 633: myself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his
LINE 634: parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us
LINE 635: with as much kindness as they did their own son.
LINE 636: We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having
LINE 637: informed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for
LINE 638: the city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the
LINE 639: Church through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released
LINE 640: captives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him,
LINE 641: and Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns
LINE 642: which the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of
LINE 643: which I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present
LINE 644: attending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we are
LINE 645: now going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers
LINE 646: has had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made
LINE 647: me the companion of Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned to
LINE 648: me, however happy, that I would rather have. The patience with which
LINE 649: she endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and the
LINE 650: eagerness she shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill me
LINE 651: with admiration, and bind me to serve her all my life; though the
LINE 652: happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine, is disturbed and
LINE 653: marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her in
LINE 654: my own country, or whether time and death may not have made such
LINE 655: changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that I
LINE 656: shall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive.
LINE 657: I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an
LINE 658: interesting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I
LINE 659: can say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my
LINE 660: fear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.
