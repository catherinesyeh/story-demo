LINE 3: Just then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions
LINE 4: from the village, came up and said, "Do you know what is going on in
LINE 5: the village, comrades?"
LINE 6: "How could we know it?" replied one of them.
LINE 7: "Well, then, you must know," continued the young man, "this morning
LINE 8: that famous student-shepherd called Chrysostom died, and it is rumoured
LINE 9: that he died of love for that devil of a village girl the daughter of
LINE 10: Guillermo the Rich, she that wanders about the wolds here in the dress
LINE 11: of a shepherdess."
LINE 12: "You mean Marcela?" said one.
LINE 13: "Her I mean," answered the goatherd; "and the best of it is, he has
LINE 14: directed in his will that he is to be buried in the fields like a Moor,
LINE 15: and at the foot of the rock where the Cork-tree spring is, because, as
LINE 16: the story goes (and they say he himself said so), that was the place
LINE 17: where he first saw her. And he has also left other directions which the
LINE 18: clergy of the village say should not and must not be obeyed because
LINE 19: they savour of paganism. To all which his great friend Ambrosio the
LINE 20: student, he who, like him, also went dressed as a shepherd, replies
LINE 21: that everything must be done without any omission according to the
LINE 22: directions left by Chrysostom, and about this the village is all in
LINE 23: commotion; however, report says that, after all, what Ambrosio and all
LINE 24: the shepherds his friends desire will be done, and to-morrow they are
LINE 25: coming to bury him with great ceremony where I said. I am sure it will
LINE 26: be something worth seeing; at least I will not fail to go and see it
LINE 27: even if I knew I should not return to the village to-morrow."
LINE 28: "We will do the same," answered the goatherds, "and cast lots to see
LINE 29: who must stay to mind the goats of all."
LINE 30: "Thou sayest well, Pedro," said one, "though there will be no need of
LINE 31: taking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don't suppose
LINE 32: it is virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that
LINE 33: ran into my foot the other day will not let me walk."
LINE 34: "For all that, we thank thee," answered Pedro.
LINE 35: Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the
LINE 36: shepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead
LINE 37: man was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,
LINE 38: who had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which
LINE 39: he returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned
LINE 40: and deeply read. "Above all, they said, he was learned in the science
LINE 41: of the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and
LINE 42: the moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact
LINE 43: time."
LINE 44: "Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two
LINE 45: luminaries," said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with
LINE 46: trifles, went on with his story, saying, "Also he foretold when the
LINE 47: year was going to be one of abundance or estility."
LINE 48: "Sterility, you mean," said Don Quixote.
LINE 49: "Sterility or estility," answered Pedro, "it is all the same in the
LINE 50: end. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who
LINE 51: believed him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,
LINE 52: bidding them 'sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow
LINE 53: pulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the
LINE 54: three following not a drop will be got.'"
LINE 55: "That science is called astrology," said Don Quixote.
LINE 56: "I do not know what it is called," replied Pedro, "but I know that he
LINE 57: knew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months
LINE 58: had passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared
LINE 59: dressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the
LINE 60: long gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,
LINE 61: Ambrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took to
LINE 62: the shepherd's dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is
LINE 63: dead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he made
LINE 64: carols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young
LINE 65: men of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When the
LINE 66: villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's
LINE 67: dress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them
LINE 68: to make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our
LINE 69: Chrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in
LINE 70: chattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a
LINE 71: large sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute
LINE 72: owner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good
LINE 73: comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a
LINE 74: countenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he
LINE 75: had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these
LINE 76: wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,
LINE 77: with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell
LINE 78: you now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,
LINE 79: and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it
LINE 80: all the days of your life, though you should live more years than
LINE 81: sarna."
LINE 82: "Say Sarra," said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's
LINE 83: confusion of words.
LINE 84: "The sarna lives long enough," answered Pedro; "and if, señor, you must
LINE 85: go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of
LINE 86: it this twelvemonth."
LINE 87: "Pardon me, friend," said Don Quixote; "but, as there is such a
LINE 88: difference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have
LINE 89: answered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue
LINE 90: your story, and I will not object any more to anything."
LINE 91: "I say then, my dear sir," said the goatherd, "that in our village
LINE 92: there was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was
LINE 93: named Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great
LINE 94: wealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected
LINE 95: woman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with
LINE 96: that countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the
LINE 97: other; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust
LINE 98: that at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other
LINE 99: world. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a
LINE 100: wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an
LINE 101: uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up
LINE 102: with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother's, which was very
LINE 103: great, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would exceed it; and
LINE 104: so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld
LINE 105: her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater
LINE 106: number were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in
LINE 107: great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great
LINE 108: beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her
LINE 109: uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not
LINE 110: only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the
LINE 111: persons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man,
LINE 112: though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old
LINE 113: enough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any
LINE 114: eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl's property
LINE 115: brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in
LINE 116: praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would
LINE 117: have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is
LINE 118: talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am,
LINE 119: that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners
LINE 120: to speak well of him, especially in villages."
LINE 121: "That is the truth," said Don Quixote; "but go on, for the story is
LINE 122: very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace."
LINE 123: "May that of the Lord not be wanting to me," said Pedro; "that is the
LINE 124: one to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before
LINE 125: his niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular
LINE 126: of the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and
LINE 127: make a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other
LINE 128: answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so
LINE 129: young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At
LINE 130: these, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle
LINE 131: ceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in
LINE 132: age and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he—and he said
LINE 133: quite right—parents are not to settle children in life against their
LINE 134: will. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the
LINE 135: demure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite
LINE 136: of her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her,
LINE 137: took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village,
LINE 138: and tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and
LINE 139: her beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many
LINE 140: rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of
LINE 141: Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,
LINE 142: as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say
LINE 143: that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because
LINE 144: Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little
LINE 145: or rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the
LINE 146: semblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the
LINE 147: contrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches
LINE 148: over her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has
LINE 149: boasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope
LINE 150: however small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid
LINE 151: or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them
LINE 152: courteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his
LINE 153: intention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that of
LINE 154: matrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kind
LINE 155: of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague
LINE 156: had got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts
LINE 157: of those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her
LINE 158: scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they
LINE 159: know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,
LINE 160: and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her
LINE 161: character; and if you should remain here any time, señor, you would
LINE 162: hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the
LINE 163: rejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where
LINE 164: there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of
LINE 165: them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,
LINE 166: and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover
LINE 167: would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human
LINE 168: beauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there
LINE 169: love songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the
LINE 170: hours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,
LINE 171: without having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the
LINE 172: morning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or
LINE 173: respite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of
LINE 174: the sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate
LINE 175: heavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautiful
LINE 176: Marcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that know her are
LINE 177: waiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the happy
LINE 178: man that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining
LINE 179: possession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being such
LINE 180: well-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause
LINE 181: of Chrysostom's death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise
LINE 182: you, señor, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which will
LINE 183: be well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not
LINE 184: half a league from this place to where he directed he should be
LINE 185: buried."
LINE 186: "I will make a point of it," said Don Quixote, "and I thank you for the
LINE 187: pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale."
LINE 188: "Oh," said the goatherd, "I do not know even the half of what has
LINE 189: happened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in
LINE 190: with some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well
LINE 191: for you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your
LINE 192: wound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of
LINE 193: an untoward result."
LINE 194: Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on
LINE 195: his part begged his master to go into Pedro's hut to sleep. He did so,
LINE 196: and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea,
LINE 197: in imitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himself
LINE 198: between Rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been
LINE 199: discarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.

LINE 201: CHAPTER XIII.
LINE 202: IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHER
LINE 203: INCIDENTS
LINE 204: c13a.jpg (181K)
LINE 205: Full Size
LINE 206: But hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the
LINE 207: east, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell
LINE 208: him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of
LINE 209: Chrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired
LINE 210: nothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once,
LINE 211: which he did with all despatch, and with the same they all set out
LINE 212: forthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting
LINE 213: of two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in
LINE 214: black sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress
LINE 215: and bitter oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his
LINE 216: hand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in
LINE 217: handsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying
LINE 218: them. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring
LINE 219: one of the other which way each party was going, they learned that all
LINE 220: were bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.
LINE 221: One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, "It
LINE 222: seems to me, Señor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay
LINE 223: we shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it
LINE 224: cannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told
LINE 225: us, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess."
LINE 226: "So I think too," replied Vivaldo, "and I would delay not to say a day,
LINE 227: but four, for the sake of seeing it."
LINE 228: Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and
LINE 229: Chrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had met
LINE 230: these shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they
LINE 231: had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one
LINE 232: of them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a
LINE 233: shepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,
LINE 234: together with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were
LINE 235: going. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.
LINE 236: This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was
LINE 237: called Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to
LINE 238: go armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote
LINE 239: replied, "The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go
LINE 240: in any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented
LINE 241: for soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made
LINE 242: for those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though
LINE 243: unworthy, am the least of all."
LINE 244: The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to
LINE 245: settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo
LINE 246: proceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.
LINE 247: "Have not your worships," replied Don Quixote, "read the annals and
LINE 248: histories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King
LINE 249: Arthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus,
LINE 250: with regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received
LINE 251: all over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but
LINE 252: was changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he
LINE 253: is to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which
LINE 254: reason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman
LINE 255: ever killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this good king that
LINE 256: famous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was
LINE 257: instituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen
LINE 258: Guinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between and
LINE 259: confidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quintañona, whence
LINE 260: came that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain—
LINE 261: O never surely was there knight
LINE 262: So served by hand of dame,
LINE 263: As served was he Sir Lancelot hight
LINE 264: When he from Britain came—
LINE 265: with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love
LINE 266: and war. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went
LINE 267: on extending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the
LINE 268: world; and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty
LINE 269: Amadis of Gaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth
LINE 270: generation, and the valiant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never
LINE 271: sufficiently praised Tirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost we
LINE 272: have seen and heard and talked with the invincible knight Don Belianis
LINE 273: of Greece. This, then, sirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I have
LINE 274: spoken of is the order of his chivalry, of which, as I have already
LINE 275: said, I, though a sinner, have made profession, and what the aforesaid
LINE 276: knights professed that same do I profess, and so I go through these
LINE 277: solitudes and wilds seeking adventures, resolved in soul to oppose my
LINE 278: arm and person to the most perilous that fortune may offer me in aid of
LINE 279: the weak and needy."
LINE 280: By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of
LINE 281: Don Quixote's being out of his senses and of the form of madness that
LINE 282: overmastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all
LINE 283: felt on first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a
LINE 284: person of great shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to
LINE 285: beguile the short journey which they said was required to reach the
LINE 286: mountain, the scene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of
LINE 287: going on with his absurdities. So he said to him, "It seems to me,
LINE 288: Señor Knight-errant, that your worship has made choice of one of the
LINE 289: most austere professions in the world, and I imagine even that of the
LINE 290: Carthusian monks is not so austere."
LINE 291: "As austere it may perhaps be," replied our Don Quixote, "but so
LINE 292: necessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the
LINE 293: truth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders
LINE 294: does no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,
LINE 295: is, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of
LINE 296: the world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray
LINE 297: for, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our
LINE 298: swords, not under shelter but in the open air, a target for the
LINE 299: intolerable rays of the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of
LINE 300: winter. Thus are we God's ministers on earth and the arms by which his
LINE 301: justice is done therein. And as the business of war and all that
LINE 302: relates and belongs to it cannot be conducted without exceeding great
LINE 303: sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that those who make it their
LINE 304: profession have undoubtedly more labour than those who in tranquil
LINE 305: peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help the weak. I do
LINE 306: not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that the
LINE 307: knight-errant's calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; I
LINE 308: would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt
LINE 309: a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, a
LINE 310: wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt that
LINE 311: the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of their
LINE 312: lives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to be
LINE 313: emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat;
LINE 314: and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages
LINE 315: to help them they would have been completely baulked in their ambition
LINE 316: and disappointed in their hopes."
LINE 317: "That is my own opinion," replied the traveller; "but one thing among
LINE 318: many others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that
LINE 319: when they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous
LINE 320: adventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they
LINE 321: never at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to
LINE 322: God, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of
LINE 323: which they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as
LINE 324: if these were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat
LINE 325: of heathenism."
LINE 326: "Sir," answered Don Quixote, "that cannot be on any account omitted,
LINE 327: and the knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is
LINE 328: usual and customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on
LINE 329: engaging in any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn
LINE 330: his eyes towards her softly and lovingly, as though with them
LINE 331: entreating her to favour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is
LINE 332: about to undertake, and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say
LINE 333: certain words between his teeth, commending himself to her with all his
LINE 334: heart, and of this we have innumerable instances in the histories. Nor
LINE 335: is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending
LINE 336: themselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing so
LINE 337: while they are engaged in their task."
LINE 338: "For all that," answered the traveller, "I feel some doubt still,
LINE 339: because often I have read how words will arise between two
LINE 340: knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their
LINE 341: anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch
LINE 342: of field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they
LINE 343: come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend
LINE 344: themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is
LINE 345: that one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and
LINE 346: through by his antagonist's lance, and as for the other, it is only by
LINE 347: holding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the
LINE 348: ground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to
LINE 349: God in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better
LINE 350: if those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the
LINE 351: midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a
LINE 352: Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have not
LINE 353: ladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love."
LINE 354: "That is impossible," said Don Quixote: "I say it is impossible that
LINE 355: there could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as
LINE 356: natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most
LINE 357: certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a
LINE 358: knight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without
LINE 359: one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who
LINE 360: had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by
LINE 361: the door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber."
LINE 362: "Nevertheless," said the traveller, "if I remember rightly, I think I
LINE 363: have read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,
LINE 364: never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he
LINE 365: was not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight."
LINE 366: To which our Don Quixote made answer, "Sir, one solitary swallow does
LINE 367: not make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply
LINE 368: in love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took
LINE 369: his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in
LINE 370: short, it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress
LINE 371: of his will, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very
LINE 372: secretly, for he prided himself on being a reticent knight."
LINE 373: "Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,"
LINE 374: said the traveller, "it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,
LINE 375: as you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as
LINE 376: reticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the
LINE 377: name of all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name,
LINE 378: country, rank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself
LINE 379: fortunate if all the world knows that she is loved and served by such a
LINE 380: knight as your worship seems to be."
LINE 381: At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, "I cannot say
LINE 382: positively whether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world
LINE 383: should know I serve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so
LINE 384: courteously asked of me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El
LINE 385: Toboso, a village of La Mancha, her rank must be at least that of a
LINE 386: princess, since she is my queen and lady, and her beauty superhuman,
LINE 387: since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the
LINE 388: poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are
LINE 389: gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her eyebrows rainbows, her eyes
LINE 390: suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her teeth pearls, her neck
LINE 391: alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her fairness snow, and
LINE 392: what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and imagine, as rational
LINE 393: reflection can only extol, not compare."
LINE 394: "We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry," said Vivaldo.
LINE 395: To which Don Quixote replied, "She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,
LINE 396: Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the
LINE 397: Moncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or
LINE 398: Villanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas,
LINE 399: Alagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques,
LINE 400: Mendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of
LINE 401: Portugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that
LINE 402: though modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most
LINE 403: illustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let none
LINE 404: dispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the foot
LINE 405: of the trophy of Orlando's arms, saying,
LINE 406: These let none move
LINE 407: Who dareth not his might with Roland prove."
LINE 408: "Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo," said the traveller, "I
LINE 409: will not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha,
LINE 410: though, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached
LINE 411: my ears."
LINE 412: "What!" said Don Quixote, "has that never reached them?"
LINE 413: The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the
LINE 414: conversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds
LINE 415: perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. Sancho
LINE 416: Panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing
LINE 417: who he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt
LINE 418: any difficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del
LINE 419: Toboso, because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever
LINE 420: come to his knowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were
LINE 421: going along conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap
LINE 422: between two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in
LINE 423: sheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, as
LINE 424: afterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress. Six of
LINE 425: the number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers
LINE 426: and branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds said, "Those who
LINE 427: come there are the bearers of Chrysostom's body, and the foot of that
LINE 428: mountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him." They
LINE 429: therefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time those
LINE 430: who came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharp
LINE 431: pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They greeted
LINE 432: each other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompanied
LINE 433: him turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, they
LINE 434: saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of one
LINE 435: thirty years of age, and showing even in death that in life he had been
LINE 436: of comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on the bier itself
LINE 437: were laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and those who
LINE 438: were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all the
LINE 439: others who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of those
LINE 440: who had borne the body said to another, "Observe carefully, Ambrosio if
LINE 441: this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that what
LINE 442: he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with."
LINE 443: "This is the place," answered Ambrosio "for in it many a time did my
LINE 444: poor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told
LINE 445: me, that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race,
LINE 446: and here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as
LINE 447: honourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela
LINE 448: ended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his
LINE 449: wretched life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he
LINE 450: desired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion." Then turning to
LINE 451: Don Quixote and the travellers he went on to say, "That body, sirs, on
LINE 452: which you are looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul
LINE 453: on which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body
LINE 454: of Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy,
LINE 455: unapproached in gentle bearing, a phœnix in friendship, generous
LINE 456: without limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in
LINE 457: short, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in all
LINE 458: that makes up misfortune. He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he
LINE 459: was scorned; he wooed a wild beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued
LINE 460: the wind, he cried to the wilderness, he served ingratitude, and for
LINE 461: reward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut short
LINE 462: by a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man, as
LINE 463: these papers which you see could fully prove, had he not commanded me
LINE 464: to consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to the
LINE 465: earth."
LINE 466: "You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner
LINE 467: himself," said Vivaldo, "for it is neither right nor proper to do the
LINE 468: will of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have
LINE 469: been reasonable in Augustus Cæsar had he permitted the directions left
LINE 470: by the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,
LINE 471: Señor Ambrosio while you consign your friend's body to the earth, you
LINE 472: should not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order
LINE 473: in bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally
LINE 474: obey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the
LINE 475: cruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come
LINE 476: to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of
LINE 477: us who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken
LINE 478: and heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the
LINE 479: cause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of his
LINE 480: life; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of
LINE 481: Marcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship,
LINE 482: together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that
LINE 483: insane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death of
LINE 484: Chrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity and
LINE 485: pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes
LINE 486: that which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and in
LINE 487: consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might
LINE 488: by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosio, or at least I on my
LINE 489: own account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allow
LINE 490: me to carry away some of them."
LINE 491: And without waiting for the shepherd's answer, he stretched out his
LINE 492: hand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which
LINE 493: Ambrosio said, "Out of courtesy, señor, I will grant your request as to
LINE 494: those you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from
LINE 495: burning the remainder."
LINE 496: Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of
LINE 497: them at once, and saw that its title was "Lay of Despair."
LINE 498: Ambrosio hearing it said, "That is the last paper the unhappy man
LINE 499: wrote; and that you may see, señor, to what an end his misfortunes
LINE 500: brought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time
LINE 501: enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug."
LINE 502: "I will do so very willingly," said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders
LINE 503: were equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud
LINE 504: voice, found that it ran as follows.
