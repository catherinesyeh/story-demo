LINE 3: "What do you think now, gentlemen," said the barber, "of what these
LINE 4: gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?"
LINE 5: "And whoever says the contrary," said Don Quixote, "I will let him know
LINE 6: he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a
LINE 7: thousand times."
LINE 8: Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don
LINE 9: Quixote's humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his
LINE 10: delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing
LINE 11: the other barber he said:
LINE 12: "Señor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your
LINE 13: profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty
LINE 14: years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of
LINE 15: them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the
LINE 16: days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a
LINE 17: headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I
LINE 18: meant to say to soldiers' arms; and I say—saving better opinions and
LINE 19: always with submission to sounder judgments—that this piece we have now
LINE 20: before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no
LINE 21: barber's basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black,
LINE 22: and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a
LINE 23: helmet, is not a complete helmet."
LINE 24: "Certainly not," said Don Quixote, "for half of it is wanting, that is
LINE 25: to say the beaver."
LINE 26: "It is quite true," said the curate, who saw the object of his friend
LINE 27: the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with
LINE 28: him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don
LINE 29: Luis's affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so
LINE 30: taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid
LINE 31: little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.
LINE 32: "God bless me!" exclaimed their butt the barber at this; "is it
LINE 33: possible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a
LINE 34: basin but a helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole
LINE 35: university, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a
LINE 36: helmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this
LINE 37: gentleman has said."
LINE 38: "To me it looks like a pack-saddle," said Don Quixote; "but I have
LINE 39: already said that with that question I do not concern myself."
LINE 40: "As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison," said the curate, "it is
LINE 41: only for Señor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all
LINE 42: these gentlemen and I bow to his authority."
LINE 43: "By God, gentlemen," said Don Quixote, "so many strange things have
LINE 44: happened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have
LINE 45: sojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively
LINE 46: in reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my
LINE 47: belief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The
LINE 48: first time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble,
LINE 49: nor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night
LINE 50: I was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing
LINE 51: how or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward
LINE 52: to give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash
LINE 53: decision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a
LINE 54: helmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether
LINE 55: this is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a
LINE 56: positive opinion, but will leave it to your worships' better judgment.
LINE 57: Perhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of
LINE 58: this place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are
LINE 59: unfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really and
LINE 60: truly are, and not as they appear to me."
LINE 61: "There can be no question," said Don Fernando on this, "but that Señor
LINE 62: Don Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision
LINE 63: of this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take
LINE 64: the votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly
LINE 65: and fully."
LINE 66: To those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this
LINE 67: afforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it
LINE 68: seemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four
LINE 69: servants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three
LINE 70: other travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had the
LINE 71: appearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were;
LINE 72: but the one who above all was at his wits' end was the barber whose
LINE 73: basin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino's
LINE 74: helmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to
LINE 75: become a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernando
LINE 76: going from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them
LINE 77: to give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there
LINE 78: had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after
LINE 79: he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud,
LINE 80: "The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number
LINE 81: of opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I
LINE 82: desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this
LINE 83: is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of
LINE 84: a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your
LINE 85: ass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and
LINE 86: proved your case very badly."
LINE 87: "May I never share heaven," said the poor barber, "if your worships are
LINE 88: not all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to
LINE 89: me a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, 'laws go,'—I say no more;
LINE 90: and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin."
LINE 91: The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the
LINE 92: absurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:
LINE 93: "There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to
LINE 94: him, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing."
LINE 95: But said one of the four servants, "Unless, indeed, this is a
LINE 96: deliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so
LINE 97: intelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare
LINE 98: and assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as
LINE 99: I perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to the
LINE 100: conclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so
LINE 101: opposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself; for I swear
LINE 102: by"—and here he rapped out a round oath—"all the people in the world
LINE 103: will not make me believe that this is not a barber's basin and that a
LINE 104: jackass's pack-saddle."
LINE 105: "It might easily be a she-ass's," observed the curate.
LINE 106: "It is all the same," said the servant; "that is not the point; but
LINE 107: whether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say."
LINE 108: On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood,
LINE 109: who had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to
LINE 110: restrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, "It is a pack-saddle as
LINE 111: sure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say
LINE 112: anything else must be drunk."
LINE 113: "You lie like a rascally clown," returned Don Quixote; and lifting his
LINE 114: pike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow
LINE 115: at his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have
LINE 116: stretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against
LINE 117: the ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade
LINE 118: assaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.
LINE 119: The landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff
LINE 120: of office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of his
LINE 121: comrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he should
LINE 122: escape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned
LINE 123: upside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the
LINE 124: same; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis
LINE 125: cried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don
LINE 126: Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him; the
LINE 127: curate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady was
LINE 128: screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea
LINE 129: was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Doña Clara in a faint. The
LINE 130: barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gave
LINE 131: one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him
LINE 132: from escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took
LINE 133: his part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was
LINE 134: belabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling
LINE 135: for help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing
LINE 136: but cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps,
LINE 137: sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the
LINE 138: midst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don
LINE 139: Quixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick
LINE 140: of the discord of Agramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn
LINE 141: like thunder, he cried out:
LINE 142: "Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to
LINE 143: me as they value their lives!"
LINE 144: All paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, "Did I not tell
LINE 145: you, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of
LINE 146: devils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with
LINE 147: your own eyes how the discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and
LINE 148: been transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for
LINE 149: the sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for
LINE 150: the helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then,
LINE 151: you, Señor Judge, and you, señor curate; let the one represent King
LINE 152: Agramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by
LINE 153: God Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as
LINE 154: we are should slay one another for such trifling cause." The officers,
LINE 155: who did not understand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and found
LINE 156: themselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their
LINE 157: companions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both
LINE 158: his beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho
LINE 159: like a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the
LINE 160: four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they
LINE 161: gained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that they
LINE 162: must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a
LINE 163: disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the
LINE 164: present; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment,
LINE 165: and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote's
LINE 166: imagination.
LINE 167: All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the
LINE 168: Judge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him
LINE 169: to return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter
LINE 170: with them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the
LINE 171: curate as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it
LINE 172: stood, and what Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that
LINE 173: Don Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that
LINE 174: it was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia,
LINE 175: where he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his
LINE 176: quality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the
LINE 177: determination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at
LINE 178: present, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of Don
LINE 179: Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it
LINE 180: between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father
LINE 181: how matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don
LINE 182: Luis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father's
LINE 183: orders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of
LINE 184: King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the
LINE 185: enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made
LINE 186: a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved
LINE 187: them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand
LINE 188: once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.
LINE 189: It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the
LINE 190: rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the
LINE 191: contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely
LINE 192: to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been
LINE 193: thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some
LINE 194: warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one
LINE 195: against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be
LINE 196: arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very
LINE 197: good reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to
LINE 198: satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote's features corresponded; and
LINE 199: taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search
LINE 200: of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick
LINE 201: reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and
LINE 202: went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and
LINE 203: discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As
LINE 204: soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the
LINE 205: warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the
LINE 206: collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted
LINE 207: aloud, "Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it
LINE 208: in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be
LINE 209: arrested."
LINE 210: The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was
LINE 211: true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote's appearance, who, on his
LINE 212: part, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,
LINE 213: worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking
LINE 214: with rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all
LINE 215: his might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have
LINE 216: yielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord,
LINE 217: who had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid
LINE 218: them. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh
LINE 219: quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately
LINE 220: caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all
LINE 221: present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, "By
LINE 222: the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments
LINE 223: of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!"
LINE 224: Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual
LINE 225: contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the
LINE 226: coat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this,
LINE 227: however, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call
LINE 228: on them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was
LINE 229: required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on
LINE 230: whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the
LINE 231: capture of this robber and footpad of the highways.
LINE 232: Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly,
LINE 233: "Come now, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give
LINE 234: freedom to those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the
LINE 235: miserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous
LINE 236: beings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven
LINE 237: should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry,
LINE 238: or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to
LINE 239: respect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! Come
LINE 240: now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence
LINE 241: of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a
LINE 242: warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that did
LINE 243: not know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that
LINE 244: their law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts
LINE 245: their will? Who, I say again, was the fool that knows not that there
LINE 246: are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or
LINE 247: exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight,
LINE 248: and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? What
LINE 249: knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen's pin-money, king's dues,
LINE 250: toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making his
LINE 251: clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him
LINE 252: pay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was
LINE 253: not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will
LINE 254: and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there,
LINE 255: or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give,
LINE 256: single-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the
LINE 257: Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way?"
LINE 258: CHAPTER XLVI.
LINE 259: OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY
LINE 260: BROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON
LINE 261: QUIXOTE
LINE 262: c46a.jpg (163K)
LINE 263: Full Size
LINE 264: While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was
LINE 265: endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as
LINE 266: they might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not
LINE 267: press the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried
LINE 268: him off, they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which
LINE 269: the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with
LINE 270: inquiring into Don Quixote's madness, but only to execute his
LINE 271: superior's orders, and that once taken they might let him go three
LINE 272: hundred times if they liked.
LINE 273: "For all that," said the curate, "you must not take him away this time,
LINE 274: nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away."
LINE 275: In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad
LINE 276: things, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they
LINE 277: had not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to
LINE 278: allow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between
LINE 279: the barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with
LINE 280: much bitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the
LINE 281: question by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not
LINE 282: perfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they
LINE 283: changed the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to
LINE 284: Mambrino's helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote's
LINE 285: knowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a
LINE 286: full receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or
LINE 287: thenceforth for evermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the most
LINE 288: important and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants
LINE 289: of Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was
LINE 290: left to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and
LINE 291: good luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve
LINE 292: difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and
LINE 293: warriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to
LINE 294: a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which
LINE 295: gave Doña Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her
LINE 296: face just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she
LINE 297: did not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing
LINE 298: why, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but
LINE 299: particularly her Spaniard's, whom she followed with her eyes and clung
LINE 300: to with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the
LINE 301: barber had not escaped the landlord's notice, and he demanded Don
LINE 302: Quixote's reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his
LINE 303: wine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante
LINE 304: nor Sancho's ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the
LINE 305: very last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando
LINE 306: paid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score;
LINE 307: and all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded
LINE 308: one of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the
LINE 309: peace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was
LINE 310: the universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and
LINE 311: eloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled generosity of Don
LINE 312: Fernando.
LINE 313: Finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as
LINE 314: well as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to
LINE 315: continue the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great
LINE 316: adventure for which he had been called and chosen; and with this high
LINE 317: resolve he went and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not
LINE 318: allow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose,
LINE 319: and said, "It is a common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the
LINE 320: mother of good fortune,' and experience has often shown in important
LINE 321: affairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case
LINE 322: to a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself
LINE 323: more plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the
LINE 324: devices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to
LINE 325: defend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it
LINE 326: seems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is
LINE 327: useless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out
LINE 328: some day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned
LINE 329: by means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him,
LINE 330: and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself
LINE 331: in some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my efforts
LINE 332: and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little? Therefore,
LINE 333: lady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and let
LINE 334: us depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only
LINE 335: kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in
LINE 336: encountering your adversary."
LINE 337: Don Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply
LINE 338: of the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style
LINE 339: adapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him in these words, "I give
LINE 340: you thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to
LINE 341: whom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy,
LINE 342: display to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your
LINE 343: wishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are
LINE 344: women in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be
LINE 345: forthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in
LINE 346: accordance with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to
LINE 347: you the defence of her person, and placed in your hands the recovery of
LINE 348: her dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which your
LINE 349: wisdom may ordain."
LINE 350: "On, then, in God's name," said Don Quixote; "for, when a lady humbles
LINE 351: herself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and
LINE 352: placing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for
LINE 353: the common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my
LINE 354: eagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell
LINE 355: seen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and
LINE 356: get ready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the
LINE 357: castellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant."
LINE 358: Sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, "Ah!
LINE 359: master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears
LINE 360: of, begging all good bodies' pardon."
LINE 361: "What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the
LINE 362: world, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 363: "If your worship is angry," replied Sancho, "I will hold my tongue and
LINE 364: leave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good
LINE 365: servant should tell his master."
LINE 366: "Say what thou wilt," returned Don Quixote, "provided thy words be not
LINE 367: meant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving
LINE 368: like thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing."
LINE 369: "It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God," said Sancho,
LINE 370: "but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls
LINE 371: herself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my
LINE 372: mother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses
LINE 373: with one that is here every instant and behind every door."
LINE 374: Dorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that her
LINE 375: husband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not
LINE 376: looking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned,
LINE 377: and Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a
LINE 378: courtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable
LINE 379: or not caring to answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued,
LINE 380: "This I say, señor, because, if after we have travelled roads and
LINE 381: highways, and passed bad nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying
LINE 382: himself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours, there is no
LINE 383: need for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the
LINE 384: ass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stay
LINE 385: quiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to dinner."
LINE 386: Good God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the
LINE 387: audacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice
LINE 388: inarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed
LINE 389: living fire, he exclaimed, "Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and
LINE 390: ignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!
LINE 391: Hast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these
LINE 392: illustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless
LINE 393: thoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou born
LINE 394: monster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,
LINE 395: inventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect
LINE 396: due to royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under
LINE 397: pain of my wrath;" and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his
LINE 398: cheeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his
LINE 399: right foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his
LINE 400: heart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and
LINE 401: terrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that
LINE 402: instant and swallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round and
LINE 403: make his escape from the angry presence of his master.
LINE 404: But the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don
LINE 405: Quixote's humour, said, to mollify his wrath, "Be not irritated at the
LINE 406: absurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful
LINE 407: Countenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from
LINE 408: his good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would
LINE 409: bear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without
LINE 410: any hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this
LINE 411: castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I
LINE 412: say, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he
LINE 413: says he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty."
LINE 414: "I swear by God Omnipotent," exclaimed Don Quixote at this, "your
LINE 415: highness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come
LINE 416: before this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have
LINE 417: been impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know
LINE 418: well enough, from the poor fellow's goodness and harmlessness, that he
LINE 419: is incapable of bearing false witness against anybody."
LINE 420: "True, no doubt," said Don Fernando, "for which reason, Señor Don
LINE 421: Quixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your
LINE 422: favour, _sicut erat in principio_, before illusions of this sort had
LINE 423: taken away his senses."
LINE 424: Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for
LINE 425: Sancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for
LINE 426: the hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him
LINE 427: to kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, "Now, Sancho my son, thou
LINE 428: wilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee,
LINE 429: that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment."
LINE 430: "So it is, I believe," said Sancho, "except the affair of the blanket,
LINE 431: which came to pass in reality by ordinary means."
LINE 432: "Believe it not," said Don Quixote, "for had it been so, I would have
LINE 433: avenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could
LINE 434: I, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong."
LINE 435: They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the
LINE 436: landlord gave them a minute account of Sancho's flights, at which they
LINE 437: laughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out
LINE 438: of countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all
LINE 439: enchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch
LINE 440: that he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,
LINE 441: without any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by
LINE 442: beings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms,
LINE 443: as his master believed and protested.
LINE 444: The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it
LINE 445: seemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without
LINE 446: giving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don
LINE 447: Quixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona,
LINE 448: the curate and the barber might carry him away with them as they
LINE 449: proposed, and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home;
LINE 450: and in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an
LINE 451: oxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him after this
LINE 452: fashion. They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough
LINE 453: to hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his
LINE 454: companions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of the
LINE 455: Brotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice
LINE 456: of the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some in
LINE 457: one way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite
LINE 458: different from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, in
LINE 459: profound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking his
LINE 460: rest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleeping
LINE 461: tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized
LINE 462: him firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awoke
LINE 463: startled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at
LINE 464: the strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way
LINE 465: to the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him,
LINE 466: and took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the
LINE 467: enchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as
LINE 468: he could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the
LINE 469: concoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there
LINE 470: Sancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own
LINE 471: proper character, and he, though he was within very little of sharing
LINE 472: his master's infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these
LINE 473: disguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he
LINE 474: saw what came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did the
LINE 475: latter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was
LINE 476: that bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and nailed the bars
LINE 477: so firmly that they could not be easily burst open.

LINE 480: They then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the
LINE 481: room an awful voice—as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle
LINE 482: but the other, was able to make it—was heard to say, "O Knight of the
LINE 483: Rueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed
LINE 484: afflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy
LINE 485: accomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged
LINE 486: thee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion
LINE 487: and the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having first
LINE 488: humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony. And from
LINE 489: this marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave
LINE 490: whelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and
LINE 491: this shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in
LINE 492: his swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou,
LINE 493: O most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard on
LINE 494: face, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the
LINE 495: flower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for
LINE 496: soon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou shalt see
LINE 497: thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, and
LINE 498: the promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false;
LINE 499: and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, that thy
LINE 500: wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow then
LINE 501: the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that
LINE 502: thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it
LINE 503: is not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to
LINE 504: that place I wot of;" and as he brought the prophecy to a close he
LINE 505: raised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft
LINE 506: tone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined
LINE 507: to take what they heard seriously.
LINE 508: Don Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once
LINE 509: comprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to
LINE 510: him that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with
LINE 511: his beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed
LINE 512: the whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being
LINE 513: thoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and
LINE 514: with a deep sigh exclaimed, "Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast
LINE 515: foretold me so much good, I implore of thee that on my part thou
LINE 516: entreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, that he
LINE 517: leave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying
LINE 518: me away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as
LINE 519: those which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, and
LINE 520: I shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains
LINE 521: wherewith they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me,
LINE 522: not as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and
LINE 523: touching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon his
LINE 524: goodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil
LINE 525: fortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my
LINE 526: power to give him the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it,
LINE 527: at least his wages shall not be lost; for in my will, which is already
LINE 528: made, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him, measured, not
LINE 529: by his many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal."
LINE 530: Sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,
LINE 531: being tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions
LINE 532: lifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.
