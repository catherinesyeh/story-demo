LINE 3: "It cannot be, señor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be
LINE 4: hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well
LINE 5: to move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may
LINE 6: quench this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is
LINE 7: more distressing than hunger."
LINE 8: The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the
LINE 9: bridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon
LINE 10: him the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their
LINE 11: way, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;
LINE 12: but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as
LINE 13: if falling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered them
LINE 14: greatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came
LINE 15: they heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction
LINE 16: the sound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by
LINE 17: nature timid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with
LINE 18: a measured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that,
LINE 19: together with the furious din of the water, would have struck terror
LINE 20: into any heart but Don Quixote's. The night was, as has been said,
LINE 21: dark, and they had happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees,
LINE 22: whose leaves stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so
LINE 23: that, what with the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the
LINE 24: water, and the rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and
LINE 25: dread; more especially as they perceived that the strokes did not
LINE 26: cease, nor the wind lull, nor morning approach; to all which might be
LINE 27: added their ignorance as to where they were.

LINE 30: But Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante,
LINE 31: and bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and
LINE 32: said, "Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven's will have been born in
LINE 33: this our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it
LINE 34: is called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant
LINE 35: deeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights
LINE 36: of the Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he
LINE 37: who is to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes
LINE 38: and Tirantes, the Phœbuses and Belianises, with the whole herd of
LINE 39: famous knights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I
LINE 40: live such exploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their
LINE 41: brightest deeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the
LINE 42: gloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of
LINE 43: those trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came,
LINE 44: that seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down from
LINE 45: the lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that
LINE 46: wounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself
LINE 47: are enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars
LINE 48: himself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the
LINE 49: kind. Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentive
LINE 50: and stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom through
LINE 51: eagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be;
LINE 52: therefore tighten Rocinante's girths a little, and God be with thee;
LINE 53: wait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come not
LINE 54: back, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favour
LINE 55: and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to my
LINE 56: incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath died in
LINE 57: attempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers."
LINE 58: When Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most
LINE 59: pathetic way, saying:
LINE 60: "Señor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful
LINE 61: adventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn
LINE 62: about and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for
LINE 63: three days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will
LINE 64: there be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time
LINE 65: heard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach
LINE 66: that he who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt
LINE 67: God by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escape
LINE 68: save by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for your
LINE 69: worship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringing
LINE 70: you out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies that
LINE 71: were with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften that
LINE 72: hard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will have
LINE 73: hardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul up
LINE 74: to anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to come
LINE 75: and serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as
LINE 76: covetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just as
LINE 77: I had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your
LINE 78: worship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of it
LINE 79: you mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God's
LINE 80: sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship will
LINE 81: not entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till
LINE 82: morning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me
LINE 83: it cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn
LINE 84: is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm."
LINE 85: "How canst thou see, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "where it makes that
LINE 86: line, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when
LINE 87: the night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole
LINE 88: heaven?"
LINE 89: "That's true," said Sancho, "but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things
LINE 90: underground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason
LINE 91: to show that it now wants but little of day."
LINE 92: "Let it want what it may," replied Don Quixote, "it shall not be said
LINE 93: of me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from
LINE 94: doing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,
LINE 95: Sancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to
LINE 96: undertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care
LINE 97: to watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is
LINE 98: to tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall come
LINE 99: back shortly, alive or dead."
LINE 100: Sancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his
LINE 101: tears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have
LINE 102: recourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till
LINE 103: daylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly
LINE 104: and without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both Rocinante's
LINE 105: legs, so that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse
LINE 106: could only move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza
LINE 107: said:
LINE 108: "See there, señor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so
LINE 109: ordered it that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate,
LINE 110: and spur and strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as
LINE 111: they say, against the pricks."
LINE 112: Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels
LINE 113: into the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion
LINE 114: of the tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or
LINE 115: until Rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of
LINE 116: something other than Sancho's ingenuity. So he said to him, "As it is
LINE 117: so, Sancho, and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till
LINE 118: dawn smiles upon us, even though I weep while it delays its coming."
LINE 119: "There is no need to weep," answered Sancho, "for I will amuse your
LINE 120: worship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you
LINE 121: like to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass
LINE 122: after the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes
LINE 123: and the moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you
LINE 124: are looking forward to."
LINE 125: "What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?" said Don
LINE 126: Quixote. "Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their
LINE 127: rest in the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do
LINE 128: as thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my
LINE 129: character."
LINE 130: "Be not angry, master mine," replied Sancho, "I did not mean to say
LINE 131: that;" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the
LINE 132: saddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master's left
LINE 133: thigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him;
LINE 134: so much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a
LINE 135: regular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he
LINE 136: had proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread of
LINE 137: what he heard would let him; "Still," said he, "I will strive to tell a
LINE 138: story which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with
LINE 139: the telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your
LINE 140: attention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is to
LINE 141: come be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it—your
LINE 142: worship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their
LINE 143: tales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato
LINE 144: Zonzorino the Roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look for
LINE 145: it,' and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show
LINE 146: that your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any
LINE 147: quarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobody
LINE 148: forces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us."
LINE 149: "Go on with thy story, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and leave the choice
LINE 150: of our road to my care."
LINE 151: "I say then," continued Sancho, "that in a village of Estremadura there
LINE 152: was a goat-shepherd—that is to say, one who tended goats—which shepherd
LINE 153: or goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruiz
LINE 154: was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess
LINE 155: called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich
LINE 156: grazier—"
LINE 157: "If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho," said Don Quixote,
LINE 158: "repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these
LINE 159: two days; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or
LINE 160: else say nothing."
LINE 161: "Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling
LINE 162: this," answered Sancho, "and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it
LINE 163: right of your worship to ask me to make new customs."
LINE 164: "Tell it as thou wilt," replied Don Quixote; "and as fate will have it
LINE 165: that I cannot help listening to thee, go on."
LINE 166: "And so, lord of my soul," continued Sancho, as I have said, this
LINE 167: shepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild
LINE 168: buxom lass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had
LINE 169: little moustaches; I fancy I see her now."
LINE 170: "Then you knew her?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 171: "I did not know her," said Sancho, "but he who told me the story said
LINE 172: it was so true and certain that when I told it to another I might
LINE 173: safely declare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of
LINE 174: time, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion,
LINE 175: contrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into
LINE 176: hatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was
LINE 177: some little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and
LINE 178: trespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her
LINE 179: from that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determined
LINE 180: to quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again.
LINE 181: Torralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediately
LINE 182: smitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before."
LINE 183: "That is the natural way of women," said Don Quixote, "to scorn the one
LINE 184: that loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho."
LINE 185: "It came to pass," said Sancho, "that the shepherd carried out his
LINE 186: intention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the
LINE 187: plains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.
LINE 188: Torralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot
LINE 189: followed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her hand and a
LINE 190: scrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of
LINE 191: looking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of
LINE 192: paint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to
LINE 193: trouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say,
LINE 194: came with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that
LINE 195: time swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came
LINE 196: to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his
LINE 197: flock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceived
LINE 198: that Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with
LINE 199: her tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely
LINE 200: that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small
LINE 201: that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he
LINE 202: spoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred
LINE 203: goats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat
LINE 204: over; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and
LINE 205: again brought over another—let your worship keep count of the goats the
LINE 206: fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be
LINE 207: an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of
LINE 208: it. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was
LINE 209: miry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going
LINE 210: and coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, and
LINE 211: another."
LINE 212: "Take it for granted he brought them all across," said Don Quixote,
LINE 213: "and don't keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an
LINE 214: end of bringing them over this twelvemonth."
LINE 215: "How many have gone across so far?" said Sancho.
LINE 216: "How the devil do I know?" replied Don Quixote.
LINE 217: "There it is," said Sancho, "what I told you, that you must keep a good
LINE 218: count; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no
LINE 219: going any farther."
LINE 220: "How can that be?" said Don Quixote; "is it so essential to the story
LINE 221: to know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be
LINE 222: a mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?"
LINE 223: "No, señor, not a bit," replied Sancho; "for when I asked your worship
LINE 224: to tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not
LINE 225: know, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my
LINE 226: memory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment."
LINE 227: "So, then," said Don Quixote, "the story has come to an end?"
LINE 228: "As much as my mother has," said Sancho.
LINE 229: "In truth," said Don Quixote, "thou hast told one of the rarest
LINE 230: stories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have
LINE 231: imagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor
LINE 232: will be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy
LINE 233: excellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those
LINE 234: ceaseless strokes may have confused thy wits."
LINE 235: "All that may be," replied Sancho, "but I know that as to my story, all
LINE 236: that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count
LINE 237: of the passage of the goats begins."
LINE 238: "Let it end where it will, well and good," said Don Quixote, "and let
LINE 239: us see if Rocinante can go;" and again he spurred him, and again
LINE 240: Rocinante made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.
LINE 241: Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now
LINE 242: approaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that
LINE 243: it was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do
LINE 244: what no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had
LINE 245: penetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by
LINE 246: as much as the black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was,
LINE 247: however, also impossible; so what he did for peace's sake was to remove
LINE 248: his right hand, which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie
LINE 249: gently and silently the running string which alone held up his
LINE 250: breeches, so that on loosening it they at once fell down round his feet
LINE 251: like fetters; he then raised his shirt as well as he could and bared
LINE 252: his hind quarters, no slim ones. But, this accomplished, which he
LINE 253: fancied was all he had to do to get out of this terrible strait and
LINE 254: embarrassment, another still greater difficulty presented itself, for
LINE 255: it seemed to him impossible to relieve himself without making some
LINE 256: noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed his shoulders together,
LINE 257: holding his breath as much as he could; but in spite of his precautions
LINE 258: he was unlucky enough after all to make a little noise, very different
LINE 259: from that which was causing him so much fear.
LINE 260: c19c.jpg (308K)
LINE 261: Full Size
LINE 262: Don Quixote, hearing it, said, "What noise is that, Sancho?"
LINE 263: "I don't know, señor," said he; "it must be something new, for
LINE 264: adventures and misadventures never begin with a trifle." Once more he
LINE 265: tried his luck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise
LINE 266: or disturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given
LINE 267: him so much discomfort. But as Don Quixote's sense of smell was as
LINE 268: acute as his hearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that
LINE 269: the fumes rose almost in a straight line, it could not be but that some
LINE 270: should reach his nose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by
LINE 271: compressing it between his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone,
LINE 272: "Sancho, it strikes me thou art in great fear."
LINE 273: "I am," answered Sancho; "but how does your worship perceive it now
LINE 274: more than ever?"
LINE 275: "Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of
LINE 276: ambergris," answered Don Quixote.
LINE 277: "Very likely," said Sancho, "but that's not my fault, but your
LINE 278: worship's, for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such
LINE 279: unwonted paces."
LINE 280: "Then go back three or four, my friend," said Don Quixote, all the time
LINE 281: with his fingers to his nose; "and for the future pay more attention to
LINE 282: thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great
LINE 283: familiarity with thee that has bred this contempt."
LINE 284: "I'll bet," replied Sancho, "that your worship thinks I have done
LINE 285: something I ought not with my person."
LINE 286: "It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho," returned Don Quixote.
LINE 287: With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the
LINE 288: night, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very
LINE 289: cautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as
LINE 290: Rocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all
LINE 291: mettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing—for as to
LINE 292: capering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote,
LINE 293: then, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a
LINE 294: signal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this time day had
LINE 295: fully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that
LINE 296: he was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade;
LINE 297: he perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but
LINE 298: could not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he
LINE 299: let Rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he
LINE 300: told him to wait for him there three days at most, as he had said
LINE 301: before, and if he should not have returned by that time, he might feel
LINE 302: sure it had been God's will that he should end his days in that
LINE 303: perilous adventure. He again repeated the message and commission with
LINE 304: which he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he was
LINE 305: not to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for before leaving
LINE 306: home he had made his will, in which he would find himself fully
LINE 307: recompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he had
LINE 308: served; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of that
LINE 309: danger, he might look upon the promised island as much more than
LINE 310: certain. Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting
LINE 311: words of his good master, and resolved to stay with him until the final
LINE 312: issue and end of the business. From these tears and this honourable
LINE 313: resolve of Sancho Panza's the author of this history infers that he
LINE 314: must have been of good birth and at least an old Christian; and the
LINE 315: feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to make him show
LINE 316: any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well as he could,
LINE 317: he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of the water and
LINE 318: of the strokes seemed to come.
LINE 319: Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,
LINE 320: his ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing
LINE 321: some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little
LINE 322: meadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of
LINE 323: water flung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely
LINE 324: constructed houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among
LINE 325: which came, they perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still
LINE 326: continued without intermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of
LINE 327: the water and of the blows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step
LINE 328: by step towards the houses, commending himself with all his heart to
LINE 329: his lady, imploring her support in that dread pass and enterprise, and
LINE 330: on the way commending himself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho
LINE 331: who never quitted his side, stretched his neck as far as he could and
LINE 332: peered between the legs of Rocinante to see if he could now discover
LINE 333: what it was that caused him such fear and apprehension. They went it
LINE 334: might be a hundred paces farther, when on turning a corner the true
LINE 335: cause, beyond the possibility of any mistake, of that dread-sounding
LINE 336: and to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept them all the night in
LINE 337: such fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; and it was (if,
LINE 338: reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fulling hammers
LINE 339: which by their alternate strokes made all the din.
LINE 340: When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid
LINE 341: from head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent
LINE 342: down upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced
LINE 343: at Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of
LINE 344: laughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his
LINE 345: vexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when
LINE 346: Sancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold
LINE 347: his sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.
LINE 348: Four times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out
LINE 349: afresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew
LINE 350: furious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, "Thou must know,
LINE 351: friend Sancho, that of Heaven's will I was born in this our iron age to
LINE 352: revive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved
LINE 353: perils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;" and here he went on
LINE 354: repeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard
LINE 355: the awful strokes.
LINE 356: Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,
LINE 357: was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two
LINE 358: such blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had
LINE 359: caught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless
LINE 360: indeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward
LINE 361: return in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it
LINE 362: still further, said to him very humbly, "Calm yourself, sir, for by God
LINE 363: I am only joking."
LINE 364: "Well, then, if you are joking I am not," replied Don Quixote. "Look
LINE 365: here, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,
LINE 366: had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the
LINE 367: courage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,
LINE 368: being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and
LINE 369: tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when
LINE 370: perhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,
LINE 371: low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn
LINE 372: me these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one
LINE 373: by one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,
LINE 374: then make what mockery you like of me."
LINE 375: "No more of that, señor," returned Sancho; "I own I went a little too
LINE 376: far with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made
LINE 377: between us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may
LINE 378: befall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),
LINE 379: was it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great
LINE 380: fear we were in?—at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see
LINE 381: now that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay
LINE 382: is."
LINE 383: "I do not deny," said Don Quixote, "that what happened to us may be
LINE 384: worth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is
LINE 385: not everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing."
LINE 386: "At any rate," said Sancho, "your worship knew how to hit the right
LINE 387: point with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the
LINE 388: shoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let
LINE 389: that pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say 'he
LINE 390: loves thee well that makes thee weep;' and moreover that it is the way
LINE 391: with great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a
LINE 392: pair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,
LINE 393: unless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms
LINE 394: on the mainland."
LINE 395: "It may be on the dice," said Don Quixote, "that all thou sayest will
LINE 396: come true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that
LINE 397: our first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the
LINE 398: future bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my
LINE 399: company; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they
LINE 400: are innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his
LINE 401: lord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault
LINE 402: of thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for
LINE 403: me; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There was
LINE 404: Gandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula
LINE 405: Firme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his
LINE 406: cap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, more
LINE 407: turquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire of
LINE 408: Galaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatness
LINE 409: of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the
LINE 410: whole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said
LINE 411: thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between
LINE 412: master and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so
LINE 413: that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more
LINE 414: respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked
LINE 415: with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits that
LINE 416: I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your
LINE 417: wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you."
LINE 418: "All that your worship says is very well," said Sancho, "but I should
LINE 419: like to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might
LINE 420: be necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a
LINE 421: knight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by
LINE 422: the day like bricklayers?"
LINE 423: "I do not believe," replied Don Quixote, "that such squires were ever
LINE 424: on wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned
LINE 425: thine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to
LINE 426: what may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in
LINE 427: these wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for
LINE 428: trifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in
LINE 429: this there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers."
LINE 430: "That is true," said Sancho, "since the mere noise of the hammers of a
LINE 431: fulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant
LINE 432: errant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open
LINE 433: my lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, but
LINE 434: only to honour you as my master and natural lord."
LINE 435: "By so doing," replied Don Quixote, "shalt thou live long on the face
LINE 436: of the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as
LINE 437: though they were parents."
