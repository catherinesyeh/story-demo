LINE 3: "Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for
LINE 4: yourselves now whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the
LINE 5: tears that flowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had
LINE 6: indulged in them more freely; and if you consider the nature of my
LINE 7: misfortune you will see that consolation is idle, as there is no
LINE 8: possible remedy for it. All I ask of you is, what you may easily and
LINE 9: reasonably do, to show me where I may pass my life unharassed by the
LINE 10: fear and dread of discovery by those who are in search of me; for
LINE 11: though the great love my parents bear me makes me feel sure of being
LINE 12: kindly received by them, so great is my feeling of shame at the mere
LINE 13: thought that I cannot present myself before them as they expect, that I
LINE 14: had rather banish myself from their sight for ever than look them in
LINE 15: the face with the reflection that they beheld mine stripped of that
LINE 16: purity they had a right to expect in me."
LINE 17: With these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread her
LINE 18: face showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart. In
LINE 19: theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes;
LINE 20: but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and
LINE 21: advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, "So then, señora, you are the
LINE 22: fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?" Dorothea was
LINE 23: astonished at hearing her father's name, and at the miserable
LINE 24: appearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how
LINE 25: wretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him:
LINE 26: "And who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father's name so
LINE 27: well? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the
LINE 28: whole story of my misfortunes."
LINE 29: "I am that unhappy being, señora," replied Cardenio, "whom, as you have
LINE 30: said, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate
LINE 31: Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your
LINE 32: present condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged,
LINE 33: bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only
LINE 34: possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to
LINE 35: me. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando,
LINE 36: and waited to hear the 'Yes' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself
LINE 37: his betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to see how her
LINE 38: fainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in her
LINE 39: bosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes
LINE 40: of ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and
LINE 41: leaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place in
LINE 42: Luscinda's hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end
LINE 43: here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would not
LINE 44: rid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps
LINE 45: to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if
LINE 46: that which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may
LINE 47: be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to
LINE 48: our misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot
LINE 49: marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so openly declared,
LINE 50: and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we may
LINE 51: reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is
LINE 52: still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we have
LINE 53: this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I
LINE 54: entreat you, señora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I
LINE 55: mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier
LINE 56: fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a
LINE 57: Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don
LINE 58: Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his
LINE 59: obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my
LINE 60: rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on
LINE 61: account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs,
LINE 62: which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself
LINE 63: to yours."
LINE 64: Cardenio's words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not
LINE 65: knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss
LINE 66: his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied
LINE 67: for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly,
LINE 68: begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where
LINE 69: they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures
LINE 70: to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do
LINE 71: what seemed to them most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him,
LINE 72: and accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had been
LINE 73: listening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly
LINE 74: words also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered his
LINE 75: services in any way that might be of use to them. He also explained to
LINE 76: them in a few words the object that had brought them there, and the
LINE 77: strange nature of Don Quixote's madness, and how they were waiting for
LINE 78: his squire, who had gone in search of him. Like the recollection of a
LINE 79: dream, the quarrel he had had with Don Quixote came back to Cardenio's
LINE 80: memory, and he described it to the others; but he was unable to say
LINE 81: what the dispute was about.

LINE 84: At this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from
LINE 85: Sancho Panza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling
LINE 86: aloud to them. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries
LINE 87: about Don Quixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his
LINE 88: shirt, lank, yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady
LINE 89: Dulcinea; and although he had told him that she commanded him to quit
LINE 90: that place and come to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had
LINE 91: answered that he was determined not to appear in the presence of her
LINE 92: beauty until he had done deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if
LINE 93: this went on, Sancho said, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor
LINE 94: as in duty bound, or even an archbishop, which was the least he could
LINE 95: be; for which reason they ought to consider what was to be done to get
LINE 96: him away from there. The licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy,
LINE 97: for they would fetch him away in spite of himself. He then told
LINE 98: Cardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote,
LINE 99: or at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that she could
LINE 100: play the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she
LINE 101: had there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might
LINE 102: trust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying
LINE 103: out their scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and
LINE 104: knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of
LINE 105: knights-errant.
LINE 106: "In that case," said the curate, "there is nothing more required than
LINE 107: to set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself
LINE 108: in our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for
LINE 109: your relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object."
LINE 110: Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some
LINE 111: rich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a
LINE 112: necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an
LINE 113: instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich
LINE 114: lady. All this, and more, she said, she had taken from home in case of
LINE 115: need, but that until then she had had no occasion to make use of it.
LINE 116: They were all highly delighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and
LINE 117: declared Don Fernando to be a man of very little taste when he rejected
LINE 118: such charms. But the one who admired her most was Sancho Panza, for it
LINE 119: seemed to him (what indeed was true) that in all the days of his life
LINE 120: he had never seen such a lovely creature; and he asked the curate with
LINE 121: great eagerness who this beautiful lady was, and what she wanted in
LINE 122: these out-of-the-way quarters.
LINE 123: "This fair lady, brother Sancho," replied the curate, "is no less a
LINE 124: personage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom
LINE 125: of Micomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of
LINE 126: him, which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has
LINE 127: done her; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has
LINE 128: acquired far and wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him."
LINE 129: "A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!" said Sancho Panza at this;
LINE 130: "especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury,
LINE 131: and right that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your
LINE 132: worship speaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed,
LINE 133: he happens to be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against
LINE 134: phantoms. But one thing among others I would beg of you, señor
LINE 135: licentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be
LINE 136: an archbishop, for that is what I'm afraid of, your worship would
LINE 137: recommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will
LINE 138: be disabled from taking archbishop's orders, and will easily come into
LINE 139: his empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking over
LINE 140: the matter carefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not do
LINE 141: for me that my master should become an archbishop, because I am no good
LINE 142: for the Church, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have a
LINE 143: wife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to
LINE 144: hold a place of profit under the Church, would be endless work; so
LINE 145: that, señor, it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once—for
LINE 146: as yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name."
LINE 147: "She is called the Princess Micomicona," said the curate; "for as her
LINE 148: kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name."
LINE 149: "There's no doubt of that," replied Sancho, "for I have known many to
LINE 150: take their name and title from the place where they were born and call
LINE 151: themselves Pedro of Alcalá, Juan of Úbeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and
LINE 152: it may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking
LINE 153: the names of their kingdoms."
LINE 154: "So it may," said the curate; "and as for your master's marrying, I
LINE 155: will do all in my power towards it:" with which Sancho was as much
LINE 156: pleased as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a
LINE 157: hold the absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had
LINE 158: evidently persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.
LINE 159: By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate's mule, and
LINE 160: the barber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told
LINE 161: Sancho to conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say
LINE 162: that he knew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master's
LINE 163: becoming an emperor entirely depended on his not recognising them;
LINE 164: neither the curate nor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them;
LINE 165: Cardenio lest he should remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with
LINE 166: him, and the curate as there was no necessity for his presence just
LINE 167: yet, so they allowed the others to go on before them, while they
LINE 168: themselves followed slowly on foot. The curate did not forget to
LINE 169: instruct Dorothea how to act, but she said they might make their minds
LINE 170: easy, as everything would be done exactly as the books of chivalry
LINE 171: required and described.

LINE 174: They had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered Don
LINE 175: Quixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without his
LINE 176: armour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho that
LINE 177: that was Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barber
LINE 178: following her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule
LINE 179: and came forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting with
LINE 180: great ease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote;
LINE 181: and though he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him
LINE 182: in this fashion:
LINE 183: "From this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until your
LINE 184: goodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honour
LINE 185: and renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolate
LINE 186: and afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong
LINE 187: arm corresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to
LINE 188: aid the helpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name,
LINE 189: hath come from far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes."
LINE 190: "I will not answer a word, beauteous lady," replied Don Quixote, "nor
LINE 191: will I listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise from
LINE 192: the earth."
LINE 193: "I will not rise, señor," answered the afflicted damsel, "unless of
LINE 194: your courtesy the boon I ask is first granted me."
LINE 195: "I grant and accord it," said Don Quixote, "provided without detriment
LINE 196: or prejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my
LINE 197: heart and freedom, it may be complied with."
LINE 198: "It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthy
LINE 199: lord," said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close to
LINE 200: his master's ear and said to him very softly, "Your worship may very
LINE 201: safely grant the boon she asks; it's nothing at all; only to kill a big
LINE 202: giant; and she who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen of
LINE 203: the great kingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia."
LINE 204: "Let her be who she may," replied Don Quixote, "I will do what is my
LINE 205: bounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what I
LINE 206: have professed;" and turning to the damsel he said, "Let your great
LINE 207: beauty rise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me."
LINE 208: "Then what I ask," said the damsel, "is that your magnanimous person
LINE 209: accompany me at once whither I will conduct you, and that you promise
LINE 210: not to engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me
LINE 211: of a traitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my
LINE 212: kingdom."
LINE 213: "I repeat that I grant it," replied Don Quixote; "and so, lady, you may
LINE 214: from this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and
LINE 215: let your failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help
LINE 216: of God and of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your
LINE 217: kingdom, and seated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm,
LINE 218: notwithstanding and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now
LINE 219: hands to the work, for in delay there is apt to be danger."
LINE 220: The distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands;
LINE 221: but Don Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight,
LINE 222: would by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with
LINE 223: great courtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to
LINE 224: Rocinante's girths, and to arm him without a moment's delay. Sancho
LINE 225: took down the armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and
LINE 226: having seen to the girths armed his master in a trice, who as soon as
LINE 227: he found himself in his armour exclaimed:
LINE 228: "Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady."
LINE 229: The barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his
LINE 230: laughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their fine
LINE 231: scheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, and
LINE 232: the promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in
LINE 233: compliance with it, he rose and took his lady's hand, and between them
LINE 234: they placed her upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and
LINE 235: the barber settled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on
LINE 236: foot, which made him feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want
LINE 237: of him now. But he bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his
LINE 238: master had now fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an
LINE 239: emperor; for he felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess,
LINE 240: and be king of Micomicon at least. The only thing that troubled him was
LINE 241: the reflection that this kingdom was in the land of the blacks, and
LINE 242: that the people they would give him for vassals would be all black; but
LINE 243: for this he soon found a remedy in his fancy, and said he to himself,
LINE 244: "What is it to me if my vassals are blacks? What more have I to do than
LINE 245: make a cargo of them and carry them to Spain, where I can sell them and
LINE 246: get ready money for them, and with it buy some title or some office in
LINE 247: which to live at ease all the days of my life? Not unless you go to
LINE 248: sleep and haven't the wit or skill to turn things to account and sell
LINE 249: three, six, or ten thousand vassals while you would be talking about
LINE 250: it! By God I will stir them up, big and little, or as best I can, and
LINE 251: let them be ever so black I'll turn them into white or yellow. Come,
LINE 252: come, what a fool I am!" And so he jogged on, so occupied with his
LINE 253: thoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about the hardship of
LINE 254: travelling on foot.
LINE 255: Cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes,
LINE 256: not knowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who
LINE 257: was very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their
LINE 258: purpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut
LINE 259: off Cardenio's beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he
LINE 260: gave him a black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet,
LINE 261: while Cardenio's appearance was so different from what it had been that
LINE 262: he would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having
LINE 263: effected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they were
LINE 264: disguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road before
LINE 265: them, for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not
LINE 266: allow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then
LINE 267: posted themselves on the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and
LINE 268: as soon as Don Quixote and his companions emerged from it the curate
LINE 269: began to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving to
LINE 270: recognise him, and after having stared at him for some time he hastened
LINE 271: towards him with open arms exclaiming, "A happy meeting with the mirror
LINE 272: of chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower
LINE 273: and cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of the
LINE 274: distressed, the quintessence of knights-errant!" And so saying he
LINE 275: clasped in his arms the knee of Don Quixote's left leg. He, astonished
LINE 276: at the stranger's words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, and
LINE 277: at length recognised him, very much surprised to see him there, and
LINE 278: made great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would not
LINE 279: allow, on which Don Quixote said, "Permit me, señor licentiate, for it
LINE 280: is not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a person
LINE 281: as your worship on foot."
LINE 282: "On no account will I allow it," said the curate; "your mightiness must
LINE 283: remain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest
LINE 284: deeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an
LINE 285: unworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches
LINE 286: of one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if
LINE 287: they have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed
LINE 288: Pegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor,
LINE 289: Muzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema,
LINE 290: a little distance from the great Complutum."
LINE 291: "Nor even that will I consent to, señor licentiate," answered Don
LINE 292: Quixote, "and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the
LINE 293: princess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle
LINE 294: of his mule to your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will
LINE 295: bear it."
LINE 296: "It will, I am sure," said the princess, "and I am sure, too, that I
LINE 297: need not order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to
LINE 298: allow a Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted."
LINE 299: "That he is," said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his
LINE 300: saddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but
LINE 301: unfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it
LINE 302: happened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying
LINE 303: ill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in
LINE 304: the air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in
LINE 305: quest of Don Quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or
LINE 306: head. As it was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the
LINE 307: ground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he
LINE 308: could do when he found himself without it was to cover his face hastily
LINE 309: with both his hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don
LINE 310: Quixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or
LINE 311: blood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:
LINE 312: "By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and
LINE 313: plucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off
LINE 314: designedly."
LINE 315: The curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme,
LINE 316: at once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master
LINE 317: Nicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast
LINE 318: had it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said
LINE 319: were a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see;
LINE 320: and as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared
LINE 321: well bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond
LINE 322: measure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him that charm when
LINE 323: he had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extend
LINE 324: beyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard
LINE 325: had been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated,
LINE 326: and when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.
LINE 327: "And so it is," said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on
LINE 328: the first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate
LINE 329: should mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they
LINE 330: reached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.
LINE 331: Three then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess,
LINE 332: and the curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho
LINE 333: Panza, Don Quixote said to the damsel:
LINE 334: "Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to
LINE 335: you;" but before she could answer the licentiate said:
LINE 336: c29d.jpg (345K)

LINE 338: "Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course? Is it
LINE 339: perchance towards that of Micomicon? It must be, or else I know little
LINE 340: about kingdoms."
LINE 341: She, being ready on all points, understood that she was to answer
LINE 342: "Yes," so she said "Yes, señor, my way lies towards that kingdom."
LINE 343: "In that case," said the curate, "we must pass right through my
LINE 344: village, and there your worship will take the road to Cartagena, where
LINE 345: you will be able to embark, fortune favouring; and if the wind be fair
LINE 346: and the sea smooth and tranquil, in somewhat less than nine years you
LINE 347: may come in sight of the great lake Meona, I mean Meotides, which is
LINE 348: little more than a hundred days' journey this side of your highness's
LINE 349: kingdom."

LINE 352: "Your worship is mistaken, señor," said she; "for it is not two years
LINE 353: since I set out from it, and though I never had good weather,
LINE 354: nevertheless I am here to behold what I so longed for, and that is my
LINE 355: lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose fame came to my ears as soon as I
LINE 356: set foot in Spain and impelled me to go in search of him, to commend
LINE 357: myself to his courtesy, and entrust the justice of my cause to the
LINE 358: might of his invincible arm."
LINE 359: "Enough; no more praise," said Don Quixote at this, "for I hate all
LINE 360: flattery; and though this may not be so, still language of the kind is
LINE 361: offensive to my chaste ears. I will only say, señora, that whether it
LINE 362: has might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to
LINE 363: your service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season,
LINE 364: I would ask the señor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought
LINE 365: him into these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am
LINE 366: filled with amazement."
LINE 367: "I will answer that briefly," replied the curate; "you must know then,
LINE 368: Señor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I
LINE 369: were going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who
LINE 370: went to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum
LINE 371: but that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which
LINE 372: is something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by
LINE 373: four footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they
LINE 374: stripped off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false
LINE 375: one, and even this young man here"—pointing to Cardenio—"they
LINE 376: completely transformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in the
LINE 377: neighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley
LINE 378: slaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very same spot by a
LINE 379: man of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards,
LINE 380: he released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been
LINE 381: out of his senses, or he must be as great a scoundrel as they, or some
LINE 382: man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep,
LINE 383: the fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded
LINE 384: justice, and opposed his king and lawful master, for he opposed his
LINE 385: just commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred
LINE 386: up the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and,
LINE 387: lastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain
LINE 388: to his body." Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the
LINE 389: adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his master
LINE 390: had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of
LINE 391: it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colour
LINE 392: at every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the
LINE 393: liberator of those worthy people. "These, then," said the curate, "were
LINE 394: they who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not let
LINE 395: them go to the punishment they deserved."
