LINE 3: He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of
LINE 4: the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and
LINE 5: right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with
LINE 6: them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well
LINE 7: bound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them
LINE 8: she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately
LINE 9: with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, "Here, your
LINE 10: worship, señor licentiate, sprinkle this room; don't leave any magician
LINE 11: of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our
LINE 12: design of banishing them from the world."
LINE 13: The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he
LINE 14: directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they
LINE 15: were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not
LINE 16: deserve the penalty of fire.
LINE 17: "No," said the niece, "there is no reason for showing mercy to any of
LINE 18: them; they have every one of them done mischief; better fling them out
LINE 19: of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to
LINE 20: them; or else carry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made
LINE 21: without the smoke giving any annoyance." The housekeeper said the same,
LINE 22: so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the
LINE 23: curate would not agree to it without first reading at any rate the
LINE 24: titles.
LINE 25: The first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was "The four books of
LINE 26: Amadis of Gaul." "This seems a mysterious thing," said the curate,
LINE 27: "for, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed
LINE 28: in Spain, and from this all the others derive their birth and origin;
LINE 29: so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the flames
LINE 30: as the founder of so vile a sect."
LINE 31: "Nay, sir," said the barber, "I too, have heard say that this is the
LINE 32: best of all the books of this kind that have been written, and so, as
LINE 33: something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned."
LINE 34: "True," said the curate; "and for that reason let its life be spared
LINE 35: for the present. Let us see that other which is next to it."
LINE 36: "It is," said the barber, "the 'Sergas de Esplandian,' the lawful son
LINE 37: of Amadis of Gaul."
LINE 38: "Then verily," said the curate, "the merit of the father must not be
LINE 39: put down to the account of the son. Take it, mistress housekeeper; open
LINE 40: the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the
LINE 41: pile for the bonfire we are to make."
LINE 42: The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy
LINE 43: "Esplandian" went flying into the yard to await with all patience the
LINE 44: fire that was in store for him.
LINE 45: "Proceed," said the curate.
LINE 46: "This that comes next," said the barber, "is 'Amadis of Greece,' and,
LINE 47: indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis
LINE 48: lineage."
LINE 49: "Then to the yard with the whole of them," said the curate; "for to
LINE 50: have the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and
LINE 51: his eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author,
LINE 52: I would burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about
LINE 53: in the guise of a knight-errant."
LINE 54: "I am of the same mind," said the barber.
LINE 55: "And so am I," added the niece.
LINE 56: "In that case," said the housekeeper, "here, into the yard with them!"
LINE 57: They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared
LINE 58: herself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.
LINE 59: "Who is that tub there?" said the curate.
LINE 60: "This," said the barber, "is 'Don Olivante de Laura.'"
LINE 61: "The author of that book," said the curate, "was the same that wrote
LINE 62: 'The Garden of Flowers,' and truly there is no deciding which of the
LINE 63: two books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying;
LINE 64: all I can say is, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool."
LINE 65: "This that follows is 'Florismarte of Hircania,'" said the barber.
LINE 66: "Señor Florismarte here?" said the curate; "then by my faith he must
LINE 67: take up his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth and
LINE 68: visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style
LINE 69: deserve nothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress
LINE 70: housekeeper."
LINE 71: "With all my heart, señor," said she, and executed the order with great
LINE 72: delight.
LINE 73: "This," said the barber, "is 'The Knight Platir.'"
LINE 74: "An old book that," said the curate, "but I find no reason for clemency
LINE 75: in it; send it after the others without appeal;" which was done.
LINE 76: Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, "The Knight of
LINE 77: the Cross."
LINE 78: "For the sake of the holy name this book has," said the curate, "its
LINE 79: ignorance might be excused; but then, they say, 'behind the cross
LINE 80: there's the devil;' to the fire with it."
LINE 81: Taking down another book, the barber said, "This is 'The Mirror of
LINE 82: Chivalry.'"
LINE 83: "I know his worship," said the curate; "that is where Señor Reinaldos
LINE 84: of Montalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves
LINE 85: than Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian
LINE 86: Turpin; however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual
LINE 87: banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention
LINE 88: of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico
LINE 89: Ariosto wove his web, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any
LINE 90: language but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he
LINE 91: speaks his own tongue I will put him upon my head."
LINE 92: "Well, I have him in Italian," said the barber, "but I do not
LINE 93: understand him."
LINE 94: "Nor would it be well that you should understand him," said the curate,
LINE 95: "and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not
LINE 96: brought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of
LINE 97: a great deal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn
LINE 98: books written in verse into another language, for, with all the pains
LINE 99: they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the
LINE 100: level of the originals as they were first produced. In short, I say
LINE 101: that this book, and all that may be found treating of those French
LINE 102: affairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until
LINE 103: after more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;
LINE 104: excepting always one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and
LINE 105: another called 'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands,
LINE 106: shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into
LINE 107: the fire without any reprieve."
LINE 108: To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and
LINE 109: proper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and
LINE 110: loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed
LINE 111: to them. Opening another book he saw it was "Palmerin de Oliva," and
LINE 112: beside it was another called "Palmerin of England," seeing which the
LINE 113: licentiate said, "Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned
LINE 114: until no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and
LINE 115: preserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be
LINE 116: made for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius
LINE 117: and set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This
LINE 118: book, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very
LINE 119: good, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise
LINE 120: and witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of
LINE 121: Miraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language
LINE 122: is polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting the
LINE 123: speaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to
LINE 124: you, Master Nicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of Gaul' be remitted
LINE 125: the penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without
LINE 126: further question or query."
LINE 127: "Nay, gossip," said the barber, "for this that I have here is the
LINE 128: famous 'Don Belianis.'"
LINE 129: "Well," said the curate, "that and the second, third, and fourth parts
LINE 130: all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile,
LINE 131: and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and
LINE 132: other greater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the
LINE 133: over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice
LINE 134: be meted out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in
LINE 135: your house and let no one read them."
LINE 136: "With all my heart," said the barber; and not caring to tire himself
LINE 137: with reading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take
LINE 138: all the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one
LINE 139: dull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the
LINE 140: broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a
LINE 141: time, she flung them out of the window.
LINE 142: In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the
LINE 143: barber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it
LINE 144: said, "History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco."
LINE 145: "God bless me!" said the curate with a shout, "'Tirante el Blanco'
LINE 146: here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury
LINE 147: of enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of
LINE 148: Montalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and
LINE 149: the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the
LINE 150: mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves
LINE 151: and wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the
LINE 152: squire Hipolito—in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best
LINE 153: book in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds,
LINE 154: and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there
LINE 155: is nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it,
LINE 156: for deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the
LINE 157: galleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see
LINE 158: that what I have said is true."
LINE 159: "As you will," said the barber; "but what are we to do with these
LINE 160: little books that are left?"
LINE 161: "These must be, not chivalry, but poetry," said the curate; and opening
LINE 162: one he saw it was the "Diana" of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing
LINE 163: all the others to be of the same sort, "these," he said, "do not
LINE 164: deserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do
LINE 165: the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of
LINE 166: entertainment that can hurt no one."
LINE 167: "Ah, señor!" said the niece, "your worship had better order these to be
LINE 168: burned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being
LINE 169: cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a
LINE 170: fancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and
LINE 171: piping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is
LINE 172: an incurable and infectious malady."
LINE 173: "The damsel is right," said the curate, "and it will be well to put
LINE 174: this stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend's way. To begin,
LINE 175: then, with the 'Diana' of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be
LINE 176: burned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage
LINE 177: Felicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of
LINE 178: verse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the
LINE 179: first of books of the kind."
LINE 180: "This that comes next," said the barber, "is the 'Diana,' entitled the
LINE 181: 'Second Part, by the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title,
LINE 182: and its author is Gil Polo."
LINE 183: "As for that of the Salamancan," replied the curate, "let it go to
LINE 184: swell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be
LINE 185: preserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and
LINE 186: make haste, for it is growing late."
LINE 187: "This book," said the barber, opening another, "is the ten books of the
LINE 188: 'Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet."
LINE 189: "By the orders I have received," said the curate, "since Apollo has
LINE 190: been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets,
LINE 191: so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its
LINE 192: way it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that
LINE 193: have as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has
LINE 194: never read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more
LINE 195: account of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of
LINE 196: Florence stuff."
LINE 197: He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on,
LINE 198: "These that come next are 'The Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs of
LINE 199: Henares,' and 'The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'"
LINE 200: "Then all we have to do," said the curate, "is to hand them over to the
LINE 201: secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never
LINE 202: have done."
LINE 203: "This next is the 'Pastor de Fílida.'"
LINE 204: "No Pastor that," said the curate, "but a highly polished courtier; let
LINE 205: it be preserved as a precious jewel."
LINE 206: "This large one here," said the barber, "is called 'The Treasury of
LINE 207: various Poems.'"
LINE 208: "If there were not so many of them," said the curate, "they would be
LINE 209: more relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain
LINE 210: vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved
LINE 211: because the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other
LINE 212: more heroic and loftier works that he has written."
LINE 213: "This," continued the barber, "is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez de
LINE 214: Maldonado."
LINE 215: "The author of that book, too," said the curate, "is a great friend of
LINE 216: mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who
LINE 217: hear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when
LINE 218: he chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is
LINE 219: good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been
LINE 220: set apart. But what book is that next it?"
LINE 221: "The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes," said the barber.
LINE 222: "That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to
LINE 223: my knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His
LINE 224: book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but
LINE 225: brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it
LINE 226: promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full
LINE 227: measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,
LINE 228: señor gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters."
LINE 229: "Very good," said the barber; "and here come three together, the
LINE 230: 'Araucana' of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the 'Austriada' of Juan Rufo,
LINE 231: Justice of Cordova, and the 'Montserrate' of Christobal de Virués, the
LINE 232: Valencian poet."
LINE 233: "These three books," said the curate, "are the best that have been
LINE 234: written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the
LINE 235: most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of
LINE 236: poetry that Spain possesses."
LINE 237: The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he
LINE 238: decided that, "contents uncertified," all the rest should be burned;
LINE 239: but just then the barber held open one, called "The Tears of Angelica."
LINE 240: "I should have shed tears myself," said the curate when he heard the
LINE 241: title, "had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of
LINE 242: the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy
LINE 243: in the translation of some of Ovid's fables."
