LINE 3: The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho
LINE 4: what was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that
LINE 5: he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The
LINE 6: innkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her
LINE 7: calling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for
LINE 8: the sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don
LINE 9: Quixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in
LINE 10: taking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, an
LINE 11: Asturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one
LINE 12: eye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be
LINE 13: sure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from
LINE 14: head to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made
LINE 15: her contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass,
LINE 16: then, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don
LINE 17: Quixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served
LINE 18: for many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a
LINE 19: carrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,
LINE 20: though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much
LINE 21: the advantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough
LINE 22: boards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness
LINE 23: might have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they not
LINE 24: seen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed
LINE 25: pebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet
LINE 26: the threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without
LINE 27: missing one in the reckoning.
LINE 28: On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and
LINE 29: her daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while
LINE 30: Maritornes—for that was the name of the Asturian—held the light for
LINE 31: them, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of
LINE 32: wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the
LINE 33: look of blows than of a fall.
LINE 34: It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and
LINE 35: projections, and that each of them had left its mark. "Pray, señora,"
LINE 36: he added, "manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone
LINE 37: to use it, for my loins too are rather sore."
LINE 38: "Then you must have fallen too," said the hostess.
LINE 39: "I did not fall," said Sancho Panza, "but from the shock I got at
LINE 40: seeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a
LINE 41: thousand thwacks."
LINE 42: "That may well be," said the young girl, "for it has many a time
LINE 43: happened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never
LINE 44: coming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as
LINE 45: weak and shaken as if I had really fallen."
LINE 46: "There is the point, señora," replied Sancho Panza, "that I without
LINE 47: dreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with
LINE 48: scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote."
LINE 49: "How is the gentleman called?" asked Maritornes the Asturian.
LINE 50: "Don Quixote of La Mancha," answered Sancho Panza, "and he is a
LINE 51: knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen
LINE 52: in the world this long time past."
LINE 53: "What is a knight-adventurer?" said the lass.
LINE 54: "Are you so new in the world as not to know?" answered Sancho Panza.
LINE 55: "Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing
LINE 56: that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most
LINE 57: miserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or
LINE 58: three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire."
LINE 59: "Then how is it," said the hostess, "that belonging to so good a master
LINE 60: as this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a
LINE 61: county?"
LINE 62: "It is too soon yet," answered Sancho, "for we have only been a month
LINE 63: going in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that
LINE 64: can be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for
LINE 65: another thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of
LINE 66: this wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not
LINE 67: change my hopes for the best title in Spain."
LINE 68: To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively,
LINE 69: and sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by
LINE 70: the hand he said to her, "Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself
LINE 71: fortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which
LINE 72: is such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is
LINE 73: commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you
LINE 74: who I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on
LINE 75: my memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my
LINE 76: gratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me
LINE 77: not so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair
LINE 78: ingrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovely
LINE 79: damsel might be the masters of my liberty."
LINE 80: The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in
LINE 81: bewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood
LINE 82: about as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they
LINE 83: could perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and
LINE 84: blandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they
LINE 85: stared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man
LINE 86: of a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in
LINE 87: pothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave
LINE 88: her attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.
LINE 89: The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,
LINE 90: and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the
LINE 91: family asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes
LINE 92: unreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made
LINE 93: promises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them
LINE 94: in a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself
LINE 95: greatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an
LINE 96: employment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and
LINE 97: ill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,
LINE 98: rickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit
LINE 99: stable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of
LINE 100: a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas
LINE 101: rather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the carrier,
LINE 102: made up, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of
LINE 103: the two best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek,
LINE 104: plump, and in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of
LINE 105: Arévalo, according to the author of this history, who particularly
LINE 106: mentions this carrier because he knew him very well, and they even say
LINE 107: was in some degree a relation of his; besides which Cid Hamete
LINE 108: Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracy in all things,
LINE 109: as is very evident since he would not pass over in silence those that
LINE 110: have been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they
LINE 111: might be, an example that might be followed by those grave historians
LINE 112: who relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a
LINE 113: taste of them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand
LINE 114: from carelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on
LINE 115: the author of "Tablante de Ricamonte" and that of the other book in
LINE 116: which the deeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what
LINE 117: minuteness they describe everything!
LINE 118: To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them
LINE 119: their second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles
LINE 120: and lay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this
LINE 121: time plastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the
LINE 122: pain of his ribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of
LINE 123: his had his eyes as wide open as a hare's.

LINE 126: The inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light
LINE 127: except that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the
LINE 128: gateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to
LINE 129: our knight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the
LINE 130: books that were the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his
LINE 131: imagination as extraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which
LINE 132: was that he fancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as
LINE 133: has been said, all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and
LINE 134: that the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the
LINE 135: castle, and that she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love
LINE 136: with him, and had promised to come to his bed for a while that night
LINE 137: without the knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that
LINE 138: he had constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to
LINE 139: consider the perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, and
LINE 140: he resolved in his heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del
LINE 141: Toboso, even though the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintañona
LINE 142: should present themselves before him.
LINE 143: While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the
LINE 144: hour—an unlucky one for him—arrived for the Asturian to come, who in
LINE 145: her smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif,
LINE 146: with noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three
LINE 147: were quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained
LINE 148: the door when Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in
LINE 149: spite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his
LINE 150: arms to receive his beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all
LINE 151: doubled up and in silence with her hands before her feeling for her
LINE 152: lover, encountered the arms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by
LINE 153: the wrist, and drawing her towards him, while she dared not utter a
LINE 154: word, made her sit down on the bed. He then felt her smock, and
LINE 155: although it was of sackcloth it appeared to him to be of the finest and
LINE 156: softest silk: on her wrists she wore some glass beads, but to him they
LINE 157: had the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair, which in some
LINE 158: measure resembled a horse's mane, he rated as threads of the brightest
LINE 159: gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: her breath,
LINE 160: which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale salad, seemed to him to
LINE 161: diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he
LINE 162: drew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the
LINE 163: same style as that which he had seen in his books of the other
LINE 164: princesses who, smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are
LINE 165: here set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the
LINE 166: poor gentleman's blindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything
LINE 167: else about the good lass that would have made any but a carrier vomit,
LINE 168: were enough to undeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he had
LINE 169: the goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp
LINE 170: he went on to say in low, tender voice:
LINE 171: "Would that I found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to
LINE 172: repay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great
LINE 173: beauty, have granted me; but fortune, which is never weary of
LINE 174: persecuting the good, has chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie
LINE 175: so bruised and broken that though my inclination would gladly comply
LINE 176: with yours it is impossible; besides, to this impossibility another yet
LINE 177: greater is to be added, which is the faith that I have pledged to the
LINE 178: peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; and
LINE 179: were it not that this stood in the way I should not be so insensible a
LINE 180: knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodness has
LINE 181: offered me."
LINE 182: Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast by
LINE 183: Don Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed to
LINE 184: her, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,
LINE 185: whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment
LINE 186: she entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote
LINE 187: said; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with
LINE 188: him for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote's bed and stood still to
LINE 189: see what would come of this talk which he could not understand; but
LINE 190: when he perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote
LINE 191: striving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and
LINE 192: delivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight
LINE 193: that he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content with this he
LINE 194: mounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pace
LINE 195: rather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and not
LINE 196: very firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight of the
LINE 197: carrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this the
LINE 198: innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl of
LINE 199: Maritornes', because after calling loudly to her he got no answer. With
LINE 200: this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter
LINE 201: where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her master
LINE 202: was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened and
LINE 203: panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and
LINE 204: crouching upon it made a ball of herself.
LINE 205: The innkeeper came in exclaiming, "Where art thou, strumpet? Of course
LINE 206: this is some of thy work." At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass
LINE 207: almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to
LINE 208: distribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon
LINE 209: Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid
LINE 210: back so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of
LINE 211: himself. He then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not,
LINE 212: raising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and
LINE 213: he and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in
LINE 214: the world. The carrier, however, perceiving by the light of the
LINE 215: innkeeper candle how it fared with his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote,
LINE 216: ran to bring her the help she needed; and the innkeeper did the same
LINE 217: but with a different intention, for his was to chastise the lass, as he
LINE 218: believed that beyond a doubt she alone was the cause of all the
LINE 219: harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat to rope, rope to
LINE 220: stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him, and the
LINE 221: innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did not give
LINE 222: themselves a moment's rest; and the best of it was that the innkeeper's
LINE 223: lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laid on one
LINE 224: upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a sound
LINE 225: spot left where a hand could light.
LINE 226: It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a
LINE 227: caudrillero of what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who,
LINE 228: also hearing the extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff
LINE 229: and the tin case with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into
LINE 230: the room crying: "Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the
LINE 231: name of the Holy Brotherhood!"
LINE 232: The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who lay
LINE 233: stretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his hand
LINE 234: falling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, "Help for
LINE 235: the Jurisdiction!" but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did
LINE 236: not move or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the
LINE 237: room were his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice
LINE 238: still higher, calling out, "Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes
LINE 239: out; they have killed a man here!" This cry startled them all, and each
LINE 240: dropped the contest at the point at which the voice reached him. The
LINE 241: innkeeper retreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the
LINE 242: lass to her crib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable
LINE 243: to move from where they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don
LINE 244: Quixote's beard, and went out to look for a light to search for and
LINE 245: apprehend the culprits; but not finding one, as the innkeeper had
LINE 246: purposely extinguished the lantern on retreating to his room, he was
LINE 247: compelled to have recourse to the hearth, where after much time and
LINE 248: trouble he lit another lamp.

LINE 250: CHAPTER XVII.
LINE 251: IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DON
LINE 252: QUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO
LINE 253: HIS MISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE
LINE 254: c17a.jpg (87K)
LINE 255: Full Size
LINE 256: By this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the same
LINE 257: tone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when
LINE 258: he lay stretched "in the vale of the stakes," he began calling to him
LINE 259: now, "Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend
LINE 260: Sancho?"
LINE 261: "How can I sleep, curses on it!" returned Sancho discontentedly and
LINE 262: bitterly, "when it is plain that all the devils have been at me this
LINE 263: night?"
LINE 264: "Thou mayest well believe that," answered Don Quixote, "because, either
LINE 265: I know little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know—but this
LINE 266: that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret until
LINE 267: after my death."
LINE 268: "I swear it," answered Sancho.
LINE 269: "I say so," continued Don Quixote, "because I hate taking away anyone's
LINE 270: good name."
LINE 271: "I say," replied Sancho, "that I swear to hold my tongue about it till
LINE 272: the end of your worship's days, and God grant I may be able to let it
LINE 273: out to-morrow."
LINE 274: "Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "that thou
LINE 275: wouldst see me dead so soon?"
LINE 276: "It is not for that," replied Sancho, "but because I hate keeping
LINE 277: things long, and I don't want them to grow rotten with me from
LINE 278: over-keeping."
LINE 279: "At any rate," said Don Quixote, "I have more confidence in thy
LINE 280: affection and good nature; and so I would have thee know that this
LINE 281: night there befell me one of the strangest adventures that I could
LINE 282: describe, and to relate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little
LINE 283: while ago the daughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that
LINE 284: she is the most elegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the
LINE 285: wide world. What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her
LINE 286: lively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe
LINE 287: to my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in
LINE 288: silence! I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so
LINE 289: great a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this
LINE 290: is more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted,
LINE 291: at the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous
LINE 292: discourse with her, there came, without my seeing or knowing whence it
LINE 293: came, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such
LINE 294: a cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then
LINE 295: pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterday
LINE 296: when the carriers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted on
LINE 297: us the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be
LINE 298: some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, and
LINE 299: that it is not for me."
LINE 300: "Not for me either," said Sancho, "for more than four hundred Moors
LINE 301: have so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and
LINE 302: fancy-bread to it. But tell me, señor, what do you call this excellent
LINE 303: and rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your
LINE 304: worship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable
LINE 305: beauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks
LINE 306: I think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!
LINE 307: for I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the
LINE 308: mishaps, the greater part falls to my share."
LINE 309: "Then thou hast been thrashed too?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 310: "Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!" said Sancho.
LINE 311: "Be not distressed, friend," said Don Quixote, "for I will now make the
LINE 312: precious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of
LINE 313: an eye."
LINE 314: By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and
LINE 315: came in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho
LINE 316: caught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a
LINE 317: cloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding
LINE 318: countenance, he said to his master, "Señor, can it be that this is the
LINE 319: enchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there be
LINE 320: anything still left in the ink-bottle?"
LINE 321: "It cannot be the Moor," answered Don Quixote, "for those under
LINE 322: enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone."
LINE 323: "If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,"
LINE 324: said Sancho; "if not, let my shoulders speak to the point."
LINE 325: "Mine could speak too," said Don Quixote, "but that is not a sufficient
LINE 326: reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor."
LINE 327: The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful
LINE 328: conversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay
LINE 329: on his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The
LINE 330: officer turned to him and said, "Well, how goes it, good man?"
LINE 331: "I would speak more politely if I were you," replied Don Quixote; "is
LINE 332: it the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you
LINE 333: booby?"
LINE 334: The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a
LINE 335: sorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of
LINE 336: oil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him
LINE 337: a badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and
LINE 338: Sancho Panza said, "That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Señor, and he
LINE 339: keeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and
LINE 340: lamp-whacks."
LINE 341: "That is the truth," answered Don Quixote, "and there is no use in
LINE 342: troubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or
LINE 343: vexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no
LINE 344: one on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou
LINE 345: canst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a
LINE 346: little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,
LINE 347: for indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing
LINE 348: much blood from the wound that phantom gave me."
LINE 349: Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the
LINE 350: innkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see
LINE 351: what had become of his enemy, he said to him, "Señor, whoever you are,
LINE 352: do us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,
LINE 353: and wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on
LINE 354: earth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted
LINE 355: Moor that is in this inn."
LINE 356: When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out
LINE 357: of his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn
LINE 358: gate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The
LINE 359: host furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don
LINE 360: Quixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the
LINE 361: blow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple
LINE 362: of rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat
LINE 363: that flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be
LINE 364: brief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them
LINE 365: all and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come
LINE 366: to perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as
LINE 367: there was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin
LINE 368: oil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over
LINE 369: the flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more
LINE 370: ave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by
LINE 371: way of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the
LINE 372: innkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully
LINE 373: engaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.
LINE 374: This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the
LINE 375: spot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and
LINE 376: so he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and
LINE 377: remained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had
LINE 378: he done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was
LINE 379: left in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke
LINE 380: into a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and
LINE 381: leave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three
LINE 382: hours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief
LINE 383: and so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,
LINE 384: and verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that
LINE 385: with this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face any
LINE 386: kind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.
LINE 387: Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as
LINE 388: miraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which
LINE 389: was no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with
LINE 390: both hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and
LINE 391: drained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that the
LINE 392: stomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his
LINE 393: master, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and
LINE 394: retchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he
LINE 395: believed his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and
LINE 396: tormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.
LINE 397: Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, "It is my belief, Sancho,
LINE 398: that this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am
LINE 399: persuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so."
LINE 400: "If your worship knew that," returned Sancho—"woe betide me and all my
LINE 401: kindred!—why did you let me taste it?"
LINE 402: At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to
LINE 403: discharge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had
LINE 404: thrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for
LINE 405: nothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and
LINE 406: convulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end
LINE 407: had come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the
LINE 408: end of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and
LINE 409: exhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has
LINE 410: been said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his
LINE 411: departure at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all
LINE 412: the time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it
LINE 413: who stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had
LINE 414: the security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by
LINE 415: this impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on
LINE 416: his squire's beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;
LINE 417: after which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he
LINE 418: laid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.
LINE 419: All that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood
LINE 420: watching him; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, and
LINE 421: he too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a
LINE 422: sigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they
LINE 423: all thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate
LINE 424: they who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.
LINE 425: As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to
LINE 426: the host and said in a very grave and measured voice, "Many and great
LINE 427: are the favours, Señor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of
LINE 428: yours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you
LINE 429: for them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you
LINE 430: of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is
LINE 431: no other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to
LINE 432: chastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this
LINE 433: kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of
LINE 434: knighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and
LINE 435: reparation to the utmost of your desire."
LINE 436: The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, "Sir Knight, I do not
LINE 437: want your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done
LINE 438: me I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is
LINE 439: that you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night,
LINE 440: as well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and
LINE 441: beds."

LINE 444: "Then this is an inn?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 445: "And a very respectable one," said the innkeeper.
LINE 446: "I have been under a mistake all this time," answered Don Quixote, "for
LINE 447: in truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it
LINE 448: appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is
LINE 449: that you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of
LINE 450: knights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have
LINE 451: read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or
LINE 452: anything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that
LINE 453: might be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the
LINE 454: insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by
LINE 455: day, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and
LINE 456: thirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and
LINE 457: all the hardships of earth."
LINE 458: "I have little to do with that," replied the innkeeper; "pay me what
LINE 459: you owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care
LINE 460: about is to get my money."
LINE 461: "You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper," said Don Quixote, and putting
LINE 462: spurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of
LINE 463: the inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance
LINE 464: without looking to see if his squire was following him.
LINE 465: The innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment
LINE 466: of Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,
LINE 467: because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and
LINE 468: reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying
LINE 469: anything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very
LINE 470: wroth, and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he
LINE 471: would not like. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry
LINE 472: his master had received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his
LINE 473: life; for the excellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not
LINE 474: going to be violated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet
LINE 475: to come into the world ever complain of him or reproach him with
LINE 476: breaking so just a privilege.
LINE 477: The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the
LINE 478: company in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three
LINE 479: needle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair
LINE 480: of Seville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and
LINE 481: playful, who, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse,
LINE 482: made up to Sancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them
LINE 483: went in for the blanket of the host's bed; but on flinging him into it
LINE 484: they looked up, and seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower than
LINE 485: what they required for their work, they decided upon going out into the
LINE 486: yard, which was bounded by the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the
LINE 487: middle of the blanket, they began to raise him high, making sport with
LINE 488: him as they would with a dog at Shrovetide.

LINE 491: The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached
LINE 492: the ears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was
LINE 493: persuaded that some new adventure was coming, until he clearly
LINE 494: perceived that it was his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about he
LINE 495: came up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and finding it shut went
LINE 496: round it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon as
LINE 497: he came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, he discovered
LINE 498: the game that was being played with his squire. He saw him rising and
LINE 499: falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his rage
LINE 500: allowed him, it is my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climb
LINE 501: from his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was so bruised and
LINE 502: battered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of his
LINE 503: horse he began to utter such maledictions and objurgations against
LINE 504: those who were blanketing Sancho as it would be impossible to write
LINE 505: down accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or their
LINE 506: work for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his lamentations,
LINE 507: mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to little
LINE 508: purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. They
LINE 509: then brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put his
LINE 510: jacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him so
LINE 511: exhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it
LINE 512: might be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it,
LINE 513: and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of
LINE 514: his master exclaiming, "Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not,
LINE 515: my son, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and
LINE 516: he held up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou
LINE 517: wilt certainly be restored."
LINE 518: At these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder
LINE 519: voice said, "Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a
LINE 520: knight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left
LINE 521: after last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and
LINE 522: leave me to myself!" and at one and the same instant he left off
LINE 523: talking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was
LINE 524: water he did not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch
LINE 525: him some wine, which she did with right good will, and paid for it with
LINE 526: her own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she was in that
LINE 527: line of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to a
LINE 528: Christian about her. When Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels
LINE 529: into his ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed out
LINE 530: very well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, though
LINE 531: it had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It is
LINE 532: true that the innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what was
LINE 533: owing to him, but Sancho took his departure in such a flurry that he
LINE 534: never missed them. The innkeeper, as soon as he saw him off, wanted to
LINE 535: bar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for they
LINE 536: were fellows who would not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote,
LINE 537: even had he been really one of the knights-errant of the Round Table.
