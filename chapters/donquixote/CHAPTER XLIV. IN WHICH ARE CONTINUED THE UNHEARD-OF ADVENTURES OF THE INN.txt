LINE 3: So loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord
LINE 4: opening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran
LINE 5: to see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined
LINE 6: him. Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same
LINE 7: outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone
LINE 8: seeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and
LINE 9: down he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the
LINE 10: travellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that
LINE 11: he shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist,
LINE 12: and rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his
LINE 13: arm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the
LINE 14: plain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming:
LINE 15: "Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided
LINE 16: my lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give
LINE 17: him the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat."
LINE 18: The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote;
LINE 19: but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and
LINE 20: not to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the
LINE 21: landlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had
LINE 22: come to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an
LINE 23: appearance, describing that of Doña Clara's lover. The landlord replied
LINE 24: that there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person
LINE 25: they were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which
LINE 26: the Judge had come, said, "He is here no doubt, for this is the coach
LINE 27: he is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to
LINE 28: look for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the
LINE 29: inn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard." "So be it," said
LINE 30: another; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and
LINE 31: the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the
LINE 32: landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all
LINE 33: these precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth
LINE 34: whose description they had given him.
LINE 35: It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in
LINE 36: consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and
LINE 37: up, but particularly Doña Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to
LINE 38: sleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover
LINE 39: so near her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he
LINE 40: saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or
LINE 41: replied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation
LINE 42: and wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry
LINE 43: that it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in
LINE 44: another enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to
LINE 45: involve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he
LINE 46: was pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have
LINE 47: made them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that
LINE 48: it would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until
LINE 49: he had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to
LINE 50: hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the
LINE 51: proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they
LINE 52: were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought
LINE 53: of anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him.
LINE 54: The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, "It becomes you well
LINE 55: indeed, Señor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed
LINE 56: in which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared
LINE 57: you."
LINE 58: The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held
LINE 59: him, but presently recognised him as one of his father's servants, at
LINE 60: which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or
LINE 61: utter a word; while the servant went on to say, "There is nothing for
LINE 62: it now, Señor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless
LINE 63: it is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure
LINE 64: for the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the
LINE 65: grief he is in at your absence."
LINE 66: "But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this
LINE 67: dress?" said Don Luis.
LINE 68: "It was a student to whom you confided your intentions," answered the
LINE 69: servant, "that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw
LINE 70: your father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his
LINE 71: servants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better
LINE 72: pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able
LINE 73: to restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you."
LINE 74: "That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders," returned Don Luis.
LINE 75: "What can you please or heaven order," said the other, "except to agree
LINE 76: to go back? Anything else is impossible."
LINE 77: All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at
LINE 78: whose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken
LINE 79: place to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time
LINE 80: dressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth
LINE 81: as "Don," and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to
LINE 82: his father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what
LINE 83: they already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him,
LINE 84: they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and
LINE 85: even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so
LINE 86: they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his
LINE 87: servant. Dorothea at this instant came out of her room, followed by
LINE 88: Doña Clara all in a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she told him in
LINE 89: a few words the story of the musician and Doña Clara, and he at the
LINE 90: same time told her what had happened, how his father's servants had
LINE 91: come in search of him; but in telling her so, he did not speak low
LINE 92: enough but that Doña Clara heard what he said, at which she was so much
LINE 93: agitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her she would have
LINE 94: fallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room,
LINE 95: as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as
LINE 96: he desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come
LINE 97: into the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his
LINE 98: father at once and without a moment's delay. He replied that he could
LINE 99: not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which
LINE 100: his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him,
LINE 101: saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that
LINE 102: they would take him away whether he liked it or not.
LINE 103: "You shall not do that," replied Don Luis, "unless you take me dead;
LINE 104: though however you take me, it will be without life."
LINE 105: By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the
LINE 106: dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the
LINE 107: Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered
LINE 108: there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.
LINE 109: Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man's story, asked the
LINE 110: men who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking to
LINE 111: carry off this youth against his will.
LINE 112: "Our object," said one of the four, "is to save the life of his father,
LINE 113: who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman's disappearance."
LINE 114: Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, "There is no need to make my affairs
LINE 115: public here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none
LINE 116: of you shall compel me."
LINE 117: "Reason will compel your worship," said the man, "and if it has no
LINE 118: power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for,
LINE 119: and what it is our duty to do."
LINE 120: "Let us hear what the whole affair is about," said the Judge at this;
LINE 121: but the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, "Do you
LINE 122: not know this gentleman, Señor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour,
LINE 123: who has run away from his father's house in a dress so unbecoming his
LINE 124: rank, as your worship may perceive."
LINE 125: The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, and
LINE 126: embracing him said, "What folly is this, Señor Don Luis, or what can
LINE 127: have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this
LINE 128: way, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?"
LINE 129: Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter a
LINE 130: word in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be
LINE 131: uneasy, for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don
LINE 132: Luis by the hand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having
LINE 133: come there.
LINE 134: But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate
LINE 135: of the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had
LINE 136: passed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it
LINE 137: was the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without
LINE 138: paying what they owed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs
LINE 139: more than other people's, caught them going out of the gate and
LINE 140: demanded his reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with such
LINE 141: language that he drove them to reply with their fists, and so they
LINE 142: began to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry
LINE 143: out, and call for help. The landlady and her daughter could see no one
LINE 144: more free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him the daughter said,
LINE 145: "Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, for
LINE 146: two wicked men are beating him to a mummy."
LINE 147: To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied,
LINE 148: "Fair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I
LINE 149: am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought
LINE 150: to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that
LINE 151: which I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your
LINE 152: father to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no
LINE 153: account to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request
LINE 154: permission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in
LINE 155: his distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him
LINE 156: from it."
LINE 157: "Sinner that I am," exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; "before you
LINE 158: have got your permission my master will be in the other world."
LINE 159: "Give me leave, señora, to obtain the permission I speak of," returned
LINE 160: Don Quixote; "and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in
LINE 161: the other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same
LINE 162: world can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those
LINE 163: who shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately
LINE 164: satisfied;" and without saying anything more he went and knelt before
LINE 165: Dorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be
LINE 166: pleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of
LINE 167: that castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted
LINE 168: it graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and
LINE 169: drawing his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were
LINE 170: still handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot
LINE 171: he stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady
LINE 172: asked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband.
LINE 173: "I hesitate," said Don Quixote, "because it is not lawful for me to
LINE 174: draw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire
LINE 175: Sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and
LINE 176: business."
LINE 177: Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively
LINE 178: exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord
LINE 179: and to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who
LINE 180: were furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the
LINE 181: hard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let
LINE 182: us leave him there; for he will surely find someone to help him, and if
LINE 183: not, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his
LINE 184: strength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what
LINE 185: Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him
LINE 186: privately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.
LINE 187: To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart
LINE 188: was troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made
LINE 189: answer:
LINE 190: "Señor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,
LINE 191: through heaven's will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Doña
LINE 192: Clara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the
LINE 193: mistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no
LINE 194: impediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my
LINE 195: father's house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her
LINE 196: whithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the
LINE 197: pole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have
LINE 198: learned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were
LINE 199: filled with tears. You know already, señor, the wealth and noble birth
LINE 200: of my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient
LINE 201: inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at
LINE 202: once as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his
LINE 203: own, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time
LINE 204: has more power to alter and change things, than human will."
LINE 205: With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after
LINE 206: hearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the
LINE 207: manner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of
LINE 208: his heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing
LINE 209: what course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the
LINE 210: answer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for
LINE 211: the present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that
LINE 212: day, so that there might be time to consider what was best for all
LINE 213: parties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his
LINE 214: tears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say
LINE 215: that of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how
LINE 216: advantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were it
LINE 217: possible, he would have preferred that it should be brought about with
LINE 218: the consent of the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title
LINE 219: for his son.
LINE 220: The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by
LINE 221: persuasion and Don Quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had
LINE 222: paid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting
LINE 223: for the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master's
LINE 224: decision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber,
LINE 225: from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino's helmet, and Sancho Panza the
LINE 226: trappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this
LINE 227: instant enter the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the
LINE 228: stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other
LINE 229: belonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and
LINE 230: made bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, "Ho, sir thief, I have caught
LINE 231: you! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that
LINE 232: you robbed me of."
LINE 233: Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse
LINE 234: poured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the
LINE 235: other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The
LINE 236: barber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made
LINE 237: in the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that
LINE 238: everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel
LINE 239: meant. "Here, in the name of the king and justice!" he cried, "this
LINE 240: thief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my
LINE 241: property."
LINE 242: "You lie," said Sancho, "I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my
LINE 243: master Don Quixote won these spoils."
LINE 244: Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his
LINE 245: squire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time
LINE 246: forth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub
LINE 247: him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling
LINE 248: sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.
LINE 249: In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,
LINE 250: "Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death,
LINE 251: and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass
LINE 252: in the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not
LINE 253: fit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day
LINE 254: I was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin,
LINE 255: never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day."
LINE 256: At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and
LINE 257: interposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the
LINE 258: pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was
LINE 259: established, and said, "Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly
LINE 260: the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin
LINE 261: which was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him
LINE 262: in fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful
LINE 263: possession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may
LINE 264: tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to
LINE 265: strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon's steed, and with
LINE 266: it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having
LINE 267: been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no
LINE 268: explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take
LINE 269: place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my
LINE 270: son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin."
LINE 271: "Egad, master," said Sancho, "if we have no other proof of our case
LINE 272: than what your worship puts forward, Mambrino's helmet is just as much
LINE 273: a basin as this good fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle."
LINE 274: "Do as I bid thee," said Don Quixote; "it cannot be that everything in
LINE 275: this castle goes by enchantment."
LINE 276: Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him,
LINE 277: and when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:
LINE 278: "Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that
LINE 279: this is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the
LINE 280: order of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I
LINE 281: took from him, without anything added to or taken from it."
LINE 282: "There is no doubt of that," said Sancho, "for from the time my master
LINE 283: won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose
LINE 284: those unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this
LINE 285: basin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there
LINE 286: was plenty of stone-throwing in that affair."
