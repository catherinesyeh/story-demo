LINE 1: "It seems to me, señor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us of
LINE 2: late have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed
LINE 3: by your worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath
LINE 4: you made not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and
LINE 5: all the rest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had
LINE 6: taken that helmet of Malandrino's, or whatever the Moor is called, for
LINE 7: I do not very well remember."
LINE 8: "Thou art very right, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "but to tell the
LINE 9: truth, it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it
LINE 10: that the affair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in
LINE 11: not reminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are
LINE 12: ways of compounding for everything in the order of chivalry."
LINE 13: "Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?" said Sancho.
LINE 14: "It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath," said Don
LINE 15: Quixote; "suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity;
LINE 16: and whether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a
LINE 17: remedy."
LINE 18: "In that case," said Sancho, "mind that your worship does not forget
LINE 19: this as you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their
LINE 20: heads to amuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship
LINE 21: if they see you so obstinate."
LINE 22: While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road
LINE 23: before they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what
LINE 24: made it still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the
LINE 25: loss of the alforjas they had lost their entire larder and
LINE 26: commissariat; and to complete the misfortune they met with an adventure
LINE 27: which without any invention had really the appearance of one. It so
LINE 28: happened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that
LINE 29: they pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king's
LINE 30: highway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league
LINE 31: or two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squire
LINE 32: hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road
LINE 33: they were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like
LINE 34: stars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did
LINE 35: Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the
LINE 36: halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still,
LINE 37: watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found
LINE 38: that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the
LINE 39: greater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a
LINE 40: man dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote's hair stood on end; he,
LINE 41: however, plucking up spirit a little, said:
LINE 42: "This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure,
LINE 43: in which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and
LINE 44: resolution."
LINE 45: "Unlucky me!" answered Sancho; "if this adventure happens to be one of
LINE 46: phantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs
LINE 47: to bear it?"
LINE 48: "Be they phantoms ever so much," said Don Quixote, "I will not permit
LINE 49: them to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with
LINE 50: thee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of
LINE 51: the yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to
LINE 52: wield my sword as I please."
LINE 53: "And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time," said
LINE 54: Sancho, "what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?"
LINE 55: "For all that," replied Don Quixote, "I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a
LINE 56: good heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is."
LINE 57: "I will, please God," answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side
LINE 58: of the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving
LINE 59: lights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty
LINE 60: encamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the
LINE 61: awe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of
LINE 62: Sancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of
LINE 63: an ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when
LINE 64: they perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered
LINE 65: over with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning
LINE 66: down to the very feet of their mules—for they could perceive plainly
LINE 67: they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the
LINE 68: encamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive
LINE 69: tone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary
LINE 70: place was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even
LINE 71: into his master's; and (save in Don Quixote's case) did so, for all
LINE 72: Sancho's resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with
LINE 73: his master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him
LINE 74: vividly as one of the adventures of his books.
LINE 75: He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne
LINE 76: some sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved
LINE 77: for him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in
LINE 78: rest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and
LINE 79: bearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the
LINE 80: encamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at
LINE 81: hand he raised his voice and said:
LINE 82: "Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye
LINE 83: are, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,
LINE 84: for, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some
LINE 85: wrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I
LINE 86: should know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,
LINE 87: or else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted
LINE 88: upon you."
LINE 89: "We are in haste," answered one of the encamisados, "and the inn is far
LINE 90: off, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;"
LINE 91: and spurring his mule he moved on.
LINE 92: Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule
LINE 93: by the bridle he said, "Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an
LINE 94: account of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,
LINE 95: all of you."
LINE 96: The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that
LINE 97: rearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An
LINE 98: attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse
LINE 99: Don Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his
LINE 100: lance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly
LINE 101: wounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the
LINE 102: agility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for
LINE 103: it seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so
LINE 104: lightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid
LINE 105: folk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and
LINE 106: set off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking
LINE 107: exactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. The
LINE 108: mourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were
LINE 109: unable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don
LINE 110: Quixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for
LINE 111: they all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away
LINE 112: the dead body they had in the litter.
LINE 113: Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,
LINE 114: and said to himself, "Clearly this master of mine is as bold and
LINE 115: valiant as he says he is."
LINE 116: A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule had
LINE 117: thrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up
LINE 118: to him he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him
LINE 119: to yield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the
LINE 120: prostrate man replied, "I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir,
LINE 121: for one of my legs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian
LINE 122: gentleman, not to kill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege,
LINE 123: for I am a licentiate and I hold first orders."
LINE 124: "Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?" said Don
LINE 125: Quixote.
LINE 126: "What, señor?" said the other. "My bad luck."
LINE 127: "Then still worse awaits you," said Don Quixote, "if you do not satisfy
LINE 128: me as to all I asked you at first."
LINE 129: "You shall be soon satisfied," said the licentiate; "you must know,
LINE 130: then, that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a
LINE 131: bachelor, and my name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I
LINE 132: come from the city of Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who
LINE 133: fled with the torches, and we are going to the city of Segovia
LINE 134: accompanying a dead body which is in that litter, and is that of a
LINE 135: gentleman who died in Baeza, where he was interred; and now, as I said,
LINE 136: we are taking his bones to their burial-place, which is in Segovia,
LINE 137: where he was born."
LINE 138: "And who killed him?" asked Don Quixote.
LINE 139: "God, by means of a malignant fever that took him," answered the
LINE 140: bachelor.
LINE 141: "In that case," said Don Quixote, "the Lord has relieved me of the task
LINE 142: of avenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him
LINE 143: having slain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug
LINE 144: one's shoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I
LINE 145: would have your reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don
LINE 146: Quixote by name, and it is my business and calling to roam the world
LINE 147: righting wrongs and redressing injuries."
LINE 148: "I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be," said the
LINE 149: bachelor, "for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with
LINE 150: a broken leg that will never see itself straight again all the days of
LINE 151: its life; and the injury you have redressed in my case has been to
LINE 152: leave me injured in such a way that I shall remain injured for ever;
LINE 153: and the height of misadventure it was to fall in with you who go in
LINE 154: search of adventures."
LINE 155: "Things do not all happen in the same way," answered Don Quixote; "it
LINE 156: all came, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by
LINE 157: night, dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying,
LINE 158: covered with mourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil
LINE 159: and of the other world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in
LINE 160: attacking you, and I should have attacked you even had I known
LINE 161: positively that you were the very devils of hell, for such I certainly
LINE 162: believed and took you to be."
LINE 163: "As my fate has so willed it," said the bachelor, "I entreat you, sir
LINE 164: knight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help
LINE 165: me to get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between
LINE 166: the stirrup and the saddle."
LINE 167: "I would have talked on till to-morrow," said Don Quixote; "how long
LINE 168: were you going to wait before telling me of your distress?"
LINE 169: He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he
LINE 170: was just then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with
LINE 171: provender, which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho
LINE 172: made a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and
LINE 173: as the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey
LINE 174: his master's call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the
LINE 175: mule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don
LINE 176: Quixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon of
LINE 177: them on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.
LINE 178: And said Sancho, "If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who
LINE 179: was the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is
LINE 180: the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the
LINE 181: Rueful Countenance."
LINE 182: The bachelor then took his departure.
LINE 183: I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,
LINE 184: "Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands
LINE 185: on a holy thing, _juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo_."
LINE 186: "I do not understand that Latin," answered Don Quixote, "but I know
LINE 187: well I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I
LINE 188: was committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which,
LINE 189: like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere,
LINE 190: but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I
LINE 191: remember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the
LINE 192: ambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, who
LINE 193: excommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar
LINE 194: bore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight."
LINE 195: On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said,
LINE 196: without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced
LINE 197: him to call him the "Knight of the Rueful Countenance" more then than
LINE 198: at any other time.
LINE 199: "I will tell you," answered Sancho; "it was because I have been looking
LINE 200: at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that
LINE 201: unfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most
LINE 202: ill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to the
LINE 203: fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders."
LINE 204: "It is not that," replied Don Quixote, "but because the sage whose duty
LINE 205: it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it
LINE 206: proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore
LINE 207: did; one being 'He of the Burning Sword,' another 'He of the Unicorn,'
LINE 208: this one 'He of the Damsels,' that 'He of the Phœnix,' another 'The
LINE 209: Knight of the Griffin,' and another 'He of the Death,' and by these
LINE 210: names and designations they were known all the world round; and so I
LINE 211: say that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind
LINE 212: just now to call me 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,' as I intend
LINE 213: to call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me
LINE 214: better, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful
LINE 215: countenance painted on my shield."
LINE 216: "There is no occasion, señor, for wasting time or money on making that
LINE 217: countenance," said Sancho; "for all that need be done is for your
LINE 218: worship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and
LINE 219: without anything more, either image or shield, they will call you 'Him
LINE 220: of the Rueful Countenance' and believe me I am telling you the truth,
LINE 221: for I assure you, señor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the
LINE 222: loss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as
LINE 223: I say, the rueful picture may be very well spared."
LINE 224: Don Quixote laughed at Sancho's pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to
LINE 225: call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he
LINE 226: had devised.
LINE 227: Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter
LINE 228: were bones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:
LINE 229: "Señor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourself
LINE 230: than any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten and
LINE 231: routed, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beaten
LINE 232: them, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in
LINE 233: search of us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the
LINE 234: mountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do
LINE 235: but make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave
LINE 236: and the living to the loaf."
LINE 237: And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,
LINE 238: feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after
LINE 239: proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves
LINE 240: in a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded
LINE 241: his beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,
LINE 242: they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying
LINE 243: their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead
LINE 244: man's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)
LINE 245: had brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of
LINE 246: ill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was
LINE 247: that they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;
LINE 248: and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where
LINE 249: they were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in
LINE 250: the following chapter.
