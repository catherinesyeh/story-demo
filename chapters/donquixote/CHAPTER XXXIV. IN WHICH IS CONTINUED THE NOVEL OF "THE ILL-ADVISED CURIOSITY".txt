LINE 1: "It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a
LINE 2: castle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman
LINE 3: looks still worse without her husband unless there are very good
LINE 4: reasons for it. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so
LINE 5: incapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I
LINE 6: shall have to go for relief to my parents' house, even if I leave yours
LINE 7: without a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved
LINE 8: that title, has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what
LINE 9: concerns you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to
LINE 10: you, nor indeed is it fitting I should say more."
LINE 11: Anselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had
LINE 12: already begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he
LINE 13: would have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he
LINE 14: sent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would
LINE 15: very shortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo's reply, which
LINE 16: placed her in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to
LINE 17: remain in her own house, nor yet to go to her parents'; for in
LINE 18: remaining her virtue was imperilled, and in going she was opposing her
LINE 19: husband's commands. Finally she decided upon what was the worse course
LINE 20: for her, to remain, resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario,
LINE 21: that she might not give food for gossip to her servants; and she now
LINE 22: began to regret having written as she had to her husband, fearing he
LINE 23: might imagine that Lothario had perceived in her some lightness which
LINE 24: had impelled him to lay aside the respect he owed her; but confident of
LINE 25: her rectitude she put her trust in God and in her own virtuous
LINE 26: intentions, with which she hoped to resist in silence all the
LINE 27: solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to her husband so as
LINE 28: not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she even began to
LINE 29: consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should ask her what
LINE 30: it was that induced her to write that letter. With these resolutions,
LINE 31: more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the next day
LINE 32: listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously that
LINE 33: Camilla's firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to
LINE 34: come to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a
LINE 35: certain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had
LINE 36: awakened in her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him
LINE 37: all the more. In short he felt that while Anselmo's absence afforded
LINE 38: time and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so he
LINE 39: assailed her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is
LINE 40: nothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair
LINE 41: women's vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact
LINE 42: with the utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with
LINE 43: such engines that had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. He
LINE 44: wept, he entreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, he
LINE 45: pretended with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that he
LINE 46: overthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he least
LINE 47: expected and most longed for. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but what
LINE 48: wonder if the friendship of Lothario could not stand firm? A clear
LINE 49: proof to us that the passion of love is to be conquered only by flying
LINE 50: from it, and that no one should engage in a struggle with an enemy so
LINE 51: mighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome his human power.
LINE 52: Leonela alone knew of her mistress's weakness, for the two false
LINE 53: friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it. Lothario did not care
LINE 54: to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he had
LINE 55: afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest she
LINE 56: should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and without
LINE 57: intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her.
LINE 58: A few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive
LINE 59: what it had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly
LINE 60: prized. He went at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they
LINE 61: embraced each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or
LINE 62: his death.
LINE 63: "The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend," said Lothario,
LINE 64: "are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and
LINE 65: crown of all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her were
LINE 66: borne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents
LINE 67: have been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into
LINE 68: open ridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is
LINE 69: she the treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty
LINE 70: abide with all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and
LINE 71: happiness upon a woman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and
LINE 72: I have had no need to touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not
LINE 73: to things so base as gifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, and
LINE 74: refrain from making further proof; and as thou hast passed dryshod
LINE 75: through the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may be
LINE 76: entertained of women, seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean of
LINE 77: new embarrassments, or with another pilot make trial of the goodness
LINE 78: and strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage
LINE 79: across the sea of this world; but reckon thyself now safe in port, moor
LINE 80: thyself with the anchor of sound reflection, and rest in peace until
LINE 81: thou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can
LINE 82: escape paying."
LINE 83: Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed
LINE 84: them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he
LINE 85: begged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the
LINE 86: sake of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make
LINE 87: use of the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do
LINE 88: was to write some verses to her, praising her under the name of
LINE 89: Chloris, for he himself would give her to understand that he was in
LINE 90: love with a lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to sing
LINE 91: her praises with the decorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were
LINE 92: unwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would compose
LINE 93: them himself.
LINE 94: "That will not be necessary," said Lothario, "for the muses are not
LINE 95: such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course
LINE 96: of the year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a
LINE 97: pretended amour of mine; as for the verses I will make them, and if not
LINE 98: as good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can
LINE 99: produce." An agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the
LINE 100: ill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house
LINE 101: asked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked
LINE 102: before—what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had sent
LINE 103: him. Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at
LINE 104: her somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but that now
LINE 105: she was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own
LINE 106: imagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being alone with
LINE 107: her. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that
LINE 108: suspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank
LINE 109: in the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that even
LINE 110: if he were not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no room
LINE 111: for fear. Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by
LINE 112: Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he himself
LINE 113: had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance
LINE 114: to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would have fallen into
LINE 115: the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she received the
LINE 116: startling news without uneasiness.
LINE 117: The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to
LINE 118: recite something of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for
LINE 119: as Camilla did not know her, he might safely say what he liked.
LINE 120: "Even did she know her," returned Lothario, "I would hide nothing, for
LINE 121: when a lover praises his lady's beauty, and charges her with cruelty,
LINE 122: he casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say
LINE 123: is that yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris,
LINE 124: which goes thus:
LINE 125: SONNET
LINE 126: At midnight, in the silence, when the eyes
LINE 127: Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close,
LINE 128: The weary tale of my unnumbered woes
LINE 129: To Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.
LINE 130: And when the light of day returning dyes
LINE 131: The portals of the east with tints of rose,
LINE 132: With undiminished force my sorrow flows
LINE 133: In broken accents and in burning sighs.
LINE 134: And when the sun ascends his star-girt throne,
LINE 135: And on the earth pours down his midday beams,
LINE 136: Noon but renews my wailing and my tears;
LINE 137: And with the night again goes up my moan.
LINE 138: Yet ever in my agony it seems
LINE 139: To me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears."
LINE 140: The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised it
LINE 141: and said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for
LINE 142: sincerity so manifest. On which Camilla said, "Then all that
LINE 143: love-smitten poets say is true?"
LINE 144: "As poets they do not tell the truth," replied Lothario; "but as lovers
LINE 145: they are not more defective in expression than they are truthful."
LINE 146: "There is no doubt of that," observed Anselmo, anxious to support and
LINE 147: uphold Lothario's ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his
LINE 148: design as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in
LINE 149: anything that was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had
LINE 150: her for their object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she
LINE 151: asked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any.
LINE 152: "I do," replied Lothario, "but I do not think it as good as the first
LINE 153: one, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge,
LINE 154: for it is this.
LINE 155: SONNET
LINE 156: I know that I am doomed; death is to me
LINE 157: As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair,
LINE 158: Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere
LINE 159: My heart repented of its love for thee.
LINE 160: If buried in oblivion I should be,
LINE 161: Bereft of life, fame, favour, even there
LINE 162: It would be found that I thy image bear
LINE 163: Deep graven in my breast for all to see.
LINE 164: This like some holy relic do I prize
LINE 165: To save me from the fate my truth entails,
LINE 166: Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.
LINE 167: Alas for him that under lowering skies,
LINE 168: In peril o'er a trackless ocean sails,
LINE 169: Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows."
LINE 170: Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first;
LINE 171: and so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was
LINE 172: binding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario was
LINE 173: doing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus
LINE 174: each step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement,
LINE 175: she mounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair
LINE 176: fame.
LINE 177: It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her
LINE 178: maid, Camilla said to her, "I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how
LINE 179: lightly I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase
LINE 180: by at least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I
LINE 181: so quickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think
LINE 182: ill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible
LINE 183: influence he brought to bear upon me."
LINE 184: "Let not that trouble you, my lady," said Leonela, "for it does not
LINE 185: take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to
LINE 186: give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized;
LINE 187: nay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice."
LINE 188: "They say also," said Camilla, "that what costs little is valued less."
LINE 189: "That saying does not hold good in your case," replied Leonela, "for
LINE 190: love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with
LINE 191: this one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it
LINE 192: burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its
LINE 193: desires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning
LINE 194: it will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for
LINE 195: there is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what
LINE 196: do you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having
LINE 197: chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and
LINE 198: it was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved
LINE 199: upon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by his
LINE 200: presence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no better
LINE 201: agent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; and of opportunity
LINE 202: he avails himself in all his feats, especially at the outset. All this
LINE 203: I know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and some day,
LINE 204: señora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh and
LINE 205: blood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or
LINE 206: yield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario's whole soul in his
LINE 207: eyes, in his sighs, in his words, his promises and his gifts, and by it
LINE 208: and his good qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love. This,
LINE 209: then, being the case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas
LINE 210: trouble your imagination, but be assured that Lothario prizes you as
LINE 211: you do him, and rest content and satisfied that as you are caught in
LINE 212: the noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has taken you, and
LINE 213: one that has not only the four S's that they say true lovers ought to
LINE 214: have, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how I
LINE 215: can repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking, Amiable, Brave,
LINE 216: Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, Illustrious,
LINE 217: Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the S's
LINE 218: according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suit
LINE 219: him, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous
LINE 220: for your honour."
LINE 221: Camilla laughed at her maid's alphabet, and perceived her to be more
LINE 222: experienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted,
LINE 223: confessing to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of
LINE 224: good birth of the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest
LINE 225: it might prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether
LINE 226: her intrigue had gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much
LINE 227: effrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies' imprudences make
LINE 228: servants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a false
LINE 229: step, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being known.
LINE 230: All that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing about
LINE 231: her doings to him whom she called her lover, and to conduct her own
LINE 232: affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo or
LINE 233: of Lothario. Leonela said she would, but kept her word in such a way
LINE 234: that she confirmed Camilla's apprehension of losing her reputation
LINE 235: through her means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she
LINE 236: perceived that her mistress's demeanour was not what it was wont to be,
LINE 237: had the audacity to introduce her lover into the house, confident that
LINE 238: even if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him; for the
LINE 239: sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they make
LINE 240: themselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to hide
LINE 241: their laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who
LINE 242: though she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with
LINE 243: her lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide
LINE 244: her, but afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed all
LINE 245: difficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable,
LINE 246: however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he sallied
LINE 247: forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at first
LINE 248: took him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away,
LINE 249: muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and
LINE 250: cautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which
LINE 251: would have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did
LINE 252: not occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an
LINE 253: untimely hour from Anselmo's house could have entered it on Leonela's
LINE 254: account, nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela;
LINE 255: all he thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with
LINE 256: him, so she had been with another; for this further penalty the erring
LINE 257: woman's sin brings with it, that her honour is distrusted even by him
LINE 258: to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes her
LINE 259: to have surrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit credence
LINE 260: to every suspicion that comes into his mind. All Lothario's good sense
LINE 261: seems to have failed him at this juncture; all his prudent maxims
LINE 262: escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally, and without
LINE 263: more ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage
LINE 264: that gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, who
LINE 265: had done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened to him and
LINE 266: said to him, "Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have been
LINE 267: struggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no
LINE 268: longer possible or right that I should conceal from thee. Know that
LINE 269: Camilla's fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will;
LINE 270: and if I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to
LINE 271: see if it were some light caprice of hers, or if she sought to try me
LINE 272: and ascertain if the love I began to make to her with thy permission
LINE 273: was made with a serious intention. I thought, too, that she, if she
LINE 274: were what she ought to be, and what we both believed her, would have
LINE 275: ere this given thee information of my addresses; but seeing that she
LINE 276: delays, I believe the truth of the promise she has given me that the
LINE 277: next time thou art absent from the house she will grant me an interview
LINE 278: in the closet where thy jewels are kept (and it was true that Camilla
LINE 279: used to meet him there); but I do not wish thee to rush precipitately
LINE 280: to take vengeance, for the sin is as yet only committed in intention,
LINE 281: and Camilla's may change perhaps between this and the appointed time,
LINE 282: and repentance spring up in its place. As hitherto thou hast always
LINE 283: followed my advice wholly or in part, follow and observe this that I
LINE 284: will give thee now, so that, without mistake, and with mature
LINE 285: deliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem the best
LINE 286: course; pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou hast
LINE 287: been wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in the
LINE 288: closet; for the tapestries and other things there afford great
LINE 289: facilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine own
LINE 290: eyes and I with mine what Camilla's purpose may be. And if it be a
LINE 291: guilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence,
LINE 292: prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of
LINE 293: punishment for the wrong done thee."
LINE 294: Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of
LINE 295: Lothario, which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear
LINE 296: them, for he now looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the
LINE 297: pretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of
LINE 298: her victory. He remained silent for a considerable time, looking on the
LINE 299: ground with fixed gaze, and at length said, "Thou hast behaved,
LINE 300: Lothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow thy advice in
LINE 301: everything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as thou seest it
LINE 302: should be kept in circumstances so unlooked for."
LINE 303: Lothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented
LINE 304: altogether of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had
LINE 305: acted, as he might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less
LINE 306: cruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his
LINE 307: hasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the mischief
LINE 308: or find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon revealing
LINE 309: all to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so,
LINE 310: he found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had the chance
LINE 311: of speaking to him, said, "Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I have
LINE 312: a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst;
LINE 313: and it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of Leonela has
LINE 314: now reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of
LINE 315: hers in this house and remains with him till morning, at the expense of
LINE 316: my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may
LINE 317: see him quitting my house at such unseasonable hours; but what
LINE 318: distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, for her privity to
LINE 319: our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers, while I
LINE 320: am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it."
LINE 321: As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to
LINE 322: delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was
LINE 323: Leonela's lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and
LINE 324: suffered, and begged him to help her, he became convinced of the truth,
LINE 325: and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse; however, he
LINE 326: told Camilla not to distress herself, as he would take measures to put
LINE 327: a stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time he told her what,
LINE 328: driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how
LINE 329: he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see
LINE 330: plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated
LINE 331: her pardon for this madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and
LINE 332: escape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had
LINE 333: involved him. Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario
LINE 334: said, and with much anger, and great good sense, she reproved him and
LINE 335: rebuked his base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution he
LINE 336: had made; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for good
LINE 337: and for evil, though it is apt to fail when she sets herself
LINE 338: deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a
LINE 339: way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, and told
LINE 340: Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himself
LINE 341: in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to obtain
LINE 342: the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any
LINE 343: apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she
LINE 344: charged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to
LINE 345: her when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answer
LINE 346: as he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening.
LINE 347: Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that he might
LINE 348: with more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to be
LINE 349: needful.
LINE 350: "I tell you," said Camilla, "there is nothing to take care of except to
LINE 351: answer me what I shall ask you;" for she did not wish to explain to him
LINE 352: beforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling to
LINE 353: follow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should try
LINE 354: or devise some other less practicable plan.
LINE 355: Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of
LINE 356: going to his friend's country house, took his departure, and then
LINE 357: returned to conceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla
LINE 358: and Leonela took care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed
LINE 359: himself in hiding in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he
LINE 360: would feel who expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare
LINE 361: before his eyes, and found himself on the point of losing the supreme
LINE 362: blessing he thought he possessed in his beloved Camilla. Having made
LINE 363: sure of Anselmo's being in his hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela
LINE 364: entered the closet, and the instant she set foot within it Camilla
LINE 365: said, with a deep sigh, "Ah! dear Leonela, would it not be better,
LINE 366: before I do what I am unwilling you should know lest you should seek to
LINE 367: prevent it, that you should take Anselmo's dagger that I have asked of
LINE 368: you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? But no; there is no
LINE 369: reason why I should suffer the punishment of another's fault. I will
LINE 370: first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of Lothario have
LINE 371: seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design so
LINE 372: base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of my
LINE 373: honour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is in
LINE 374: the street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel it
LINE 375: may be, but honourable, shall be carried out first."
LINE 376: "Ah, señora," said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, "what is it
LINE 377: you want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your
LINE 378: own life, or Lothario's? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to
LINE 379: the loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble
LINE 380: your wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the
LINE 381: house now and finding us alone; consider, señora, we are weak women and
LINE 382: he is a man, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose,
LINE 383: blind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into
LINE 384: execution he may do what will be worse for you than taking your life.
LINE 385: Ill betide my master, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house
LINE 386: to this shameless fellow! And supposing you kill him, señora, as I
LINE 387: suspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him when he is dead?"
LINE 388: "What, my friend?" replied Camilla, "we shall leave him for Anselmo to
LINE 389: bury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his
LINE 390: own infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I
LINE 391: delay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against
LINE 392: the loyalty I owe my husband."
LINE 393: Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered
LINE 394: made him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to
LINE 395: kill Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to
LINE 396: avert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a
LINE 397: resolution so bold and virtuous he restrained himself, intending to
LINE 398: come forth in time to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla,
LINE 399: throwing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, and
LINE 400: Leonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, "Woe is me! that I should
LINE 401: be fated to have dying here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth,
LINE 402: the crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!" with more to the
LINE 403: same effect, so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for the
LINE 404: most tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and her
LINE 405: mistress for another persecuted Penelope.
LINE 406: Camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming
LINE 407: to herself she said, "Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that
LINE 408: friend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night
LINE 409: concealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn
LINE 410: itself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt
LINE 411: away in menaces and maledictions."
LINE 412: "I am just going to call him, señora," said Leonela; "but you must
LINE 413: first give me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of
LINE 414: it give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives."
LINE 415: "Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so," said Camilla, "for rash
LINE 416: and foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not
LINE 417: going to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself
LINE 418: without having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him
LINE 419: on whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die;
LINE 420: but it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to
LINE 421: weep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to."
LINE 422: Leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario,
LINE 423: but at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued,
LINE 424: as if speaking to herself, "Good God! would it not have been more
LINE 425: prudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before,
LINE 426: than to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile,
LINE 427: even for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it
LINE 428: would have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of
LINE 429: my husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from
LINE 430: the strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay
LINE 431: with his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world
LINE 432: know (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only
LINE 433: preserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who
LINE 434: dared to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this
LINE 435: to Anselmo. But then I have called his attention to it in the letter I
LINE 436: wrote to him in the country, and, if he did nothing to prevent the
LINE 437: mischief I there pointed out to him, I suppose it was that from pure
LINE 438: goodness of heart and trustfulness he would not and could not believe
LINE 439: that any thought against his honour could harbour in the breast of so
LINE 440: stanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself believe it for many days, nor
LINE 441: should I have ever believed it if his insolence had not gone so far as
LINE 442: to make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaseless
LINE 443: tears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold determination stand in need
LINE 444: of arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid!
LINE 445: Let the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his life, and
LINE 446: then befall what may. Pure I came to him whom Heaven bestowed upon me,
LINE 447: pure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed in my own chaste blood
LINE 448: and in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in
LINE 449: the world;" and as she uttered these words she paced the room holding
LINE 450: the unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, and
LINE 451: such gestures that one would have supposed her to have lost her senses,
LINE 452: and taken her for some violent desperado instead of a delicate woman.
LINE 453: Anselmo, concealed behind some tapestries where he had hidden himself,
LINE 454: beheld and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seen
LINE 455: and heard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he
LINE 456: would have been now well pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario's
LINE 457: coming were dispensed with, as he feared some sudden mishap; but as he
LINE 458: was on the point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace and
LINE 459: undeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonela returning, leading
LINE 460: Lothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line in front of her
LINE 461: on the floor with the dagger, said to him, "Lothario, pay attention to
LINE 462: what I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this line
LINE 463: thou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that
LINE 464: same instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my
LINE 465: hand; and before thou answerest me a word I desire thee to listen to a
LINE 466: few from me, and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First,
LINE 467: I desire thee to tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo,
LINE 468: and in what light thou regardest him; and secondly I desire to know if
LINE 469: thou knowest me too. Answer me this, without embarrassment or
LINE 470: reflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, for they are no riddles I put
LINE 471: to thee."
LINE 472: Lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilla
LINE 473: directed him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what she
LINE 474: intended to do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and
LINE 475: promptly that between them they made the imposture look more true than
LINE 476: truth; so he answered her thus: "I did not think, fair Camilla, that
LINE 477: thou wert calling me to ask questions so remote from the object with
LINE 478: which I come; but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing
LINE 479: so, thou mightst have put it off still longer, for the longing for
LINE 480: happiness gives the more distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining
LINE 481: it; but lest thou shouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, I
LINE 482: say that I know thy husband Anselmo, and that we have known each other
LINE 483: from our earliest years; I will not speak of what thou too knowest, of
LINE 484: our friendship, that I may not compel myself to testify against the
LINE 485: wrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors, makes me inflict
LINE 486: upon him. Thee I know and hold in the same estimation as he does, for
LINE 487: were it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted in opposition to what
LINE 488: I owe to my station and the holy laws of true friendship, now broken
LINE 489: and violated by me through that powerful enemy, love."
LINE 490: "If thou dost confess that," returned Camilla, "mortal enemy of all
LINE 491: that rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to
LINE 492: come before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is
LINE 493: reflected on whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou
LINE 494: wrongest him? But, woe is me, I now comprehend what has made thee give
LINE 495: so little heed to what thou owest to thyself; it must have been some
LINE 496: freedom of mine, for I will not call it immodesty, as it did not
LINE 497: proceed from any deliberate intention, but from some heedlessness such
LINE 498: as women are guilty of through inadvertence when they think they have
LINE 499: no occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, when did I by word or
LINE 500: sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow of
LINE 501: hope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy professions of
LINE 502: love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When were thy
LINE 503: frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?
LINE 504: But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt to
LINE 505: win love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myself
LINE 506: the blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of mine
LINE 507: has all this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish
LINE 508: myself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And that
LINE 509: thou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly be
LINE 510: otherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the
LINE 511: sacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband,
LINE 512: wronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me
LINE 513: too through want of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given
LINE 514: any, of encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say
LINE 515: the suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered
LINE 516: these lawless thoughts in thee, is what causes me most distress and
LINE 517: what I desire most to punish with my own hands, for were any other
LINE 518: instrument of punishment employed my error might become perhaps more
LINE 519: widely known; but before I do so, in my death I mean to inflict death,
LINE 520: and take with me one that will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge
LINE 521: I hope for and have; for I shall see, wheresoever it may be that I go,
LINE 522: the penalty awarded by inflexible, unswerving justice on him who has
LINE 523: placed me in a position so desperate."
LINE 524: As she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she
LINE 525: flew upon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying
LINE 526: it in his breast that he was almost uncertain whether these
LINE 527: demonstrations were real or feigned, for he was obliged to have
LINE 528: recourse to all his skill and strength to prevent her from striking
LINE 529: him; and with such reality did she act this strange farce and
LINE 530: mystification that, to give it a colour of truth, she determined to
LINE 531: stain it with her own blood; for perceiving, or pretending, that she
LINE 532: could not wound Lothario, she said, "Fate, it seems, will not grant my
LINE 533: just desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be able to keep me
LINE 534: from satisfying it partially at least;" and making an effort to free
LINE 535: the hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp, she released
LINE 536: it, and directing the point to a place where it could not inflict a
LINE 537: deep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close to the
LINE 538: shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a
LINE 539: faint.
LINE 540: Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, and
LINE 541: seeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they
LINE 542: were still uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario,
LINE 543: terrified and breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but
LINE 544: when he saw how slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and
LINE 545: once more admired the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair
LINE 546: Camilla; and the better to support the part he had to play he began to
LINE 547: utter profuse and doleful lamentations over her body as if she were
LINE 548: dead, invoking maledictions not only on himself but also on him who had
LINE 549: been the means of placing him in such a position: and knowing that his
LINE 550: friend Anselmo heard him he spoke in such a way as to make a listener
LINE 551: feel much more pity for him than for Camilla, even though he supposed
LINE 552: her dead. Leonela took her up in her arms and laid her on the bed,
LINE 553: entreating Lothario to go in quest of someone to attend to her wound in
LINE 554: secret, and at the same time asking his advice and opinion as to what
LINE 555: they should say to Anselmo about his lady's wound if he should chance
LINE 556: to return before it was healed. He replied they might say what they
LINE 557: liked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of any
LINE 558: use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he was
LINE 559: going where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of
LINE 560: deep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself
LINE 561: alone, and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself
LINE 562: unceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the
LINE 563: consistent acting of Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would
LINE 564: be that he had a second Portia for a wife, and he looked forward
LINE 565: anxiously to meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehood
LINE 566: and truth the most craftily veiled that could be imagined.
LINE 567: Leonela, as he told her, stanched her lady's blood, which was no more
LINE 568: than sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a
LINE 569: little wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the
LINE 570: time she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had
LINE 571: been said before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had
LINE 572: in Camilla a model of purity. To Leonela's words Camilla added her own,
LINE 573: calling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not
LINE 574: enough at the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the life
LINE 575: she so much loathed. She asked her attendant's advice as to whether or
LINE 576: not she ought to inform her beloved husband of all that had happened,
LINE 577: but the other bade her say nothing about it, as she would lay upon him
LINE 578: the obligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, which he could not do
LINE 579: but at great risk to himself; and it was the duty of a true wife not to
LINE 580: give her husband provocation to quarrel, but, on the contrary, to
LINE 581: remove it as far as possible from him.
LINE 582: Camilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would
LINE 583: follow her advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she
LINE 584: was to explain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it;
LINE 585: to which Leonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even
LINE 586: in jest.
LINE 587: "How then can I know, my dear?" said Camilla, "for I should not dare to
LINE 588: forge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can think
LINE 589: of no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him the
LINE 590: plain truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story."
LINE 591: "Be not uneasy, señora," said Leonela; "between this and to-morrow I
LINE 592: will think of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound being
LINE 593: where it is it can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased
LINE 594: to aid us in a purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself,
LINE 595: señora, and endeavour to calm your excitement lest my lord find you
LINE 596: agitated; and leave the rest to my care and God's, who always supports
LINE 597: good intentions."
LINE 598: Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out
LINE 599: the tragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted with
LINE 600: such wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become
LINE 601: the realities of the parts they played. He longed for night and an
LINE 602: opportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend
LINE 603: Lothario, and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he
LINE 604: had gained in having established his wife's purity. Both mistress and
LINE 605: maid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away, and taking
LINE 606: advantage of it he made his escape, and at once went in quest of
LINE 607: Lothario, and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced him
LINE 608: when he found him, and the things he said to him in the joy of his
LINE 609: heart, and the praises he bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothario
LINE 610: listened to without being able to show any pleasure, for he could not
LINE 611: forget how deceived his friend was, and how dishonourably he had
LINE 612: wronged him; and though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad,
LINE 613: still he imagined it was only because he had left Camilla wounded and
LINE 614: had been himself the cause of it; and so among other things he told him
LINE 615: not to be distressed about Camilla's accident, for, as they had agreed
LINE 616: to hide it from him, the wound was evidently trifling; and that being
LINE 617: so, he had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be of good cheer
LINE 618: and rejoice with him, seeing that by his means and adroitness he found
LINE 619: himself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he could have
LINE 620: ventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than making verses
LINE 621: in praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time to come.
LINE 622: Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him
LINE 623: in raising a monument so glorious.
LINE 624: And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could
LINE 625: be in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument
LINE 626: of his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter
LINE 627: destruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted
LINE 628: countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried
LINE 629: on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her
LINE 630: wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed
LINE 631: was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his
LINE 632: ill-advised curiosity.
