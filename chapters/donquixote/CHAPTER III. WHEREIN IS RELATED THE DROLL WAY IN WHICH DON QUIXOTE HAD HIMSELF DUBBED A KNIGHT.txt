LINE 3: Harassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse
LINE 4: supper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting
LINE 5: himself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying,
LINE 6: "From this spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants
LINE 7: me the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the
LINE 8: benefit of the human race." The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet
LINE 9: and hearing a speech of this kind, stood staring at him in
LINE 10: bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him to
LINE 11: rise, but all to no purpose until he had agreed to grant the boon
LINE 12: demanded of him. "I looked for no less, my lord, from your High
LINE 13: Magnificence," replied Don Quixote, "and I have to tell you that the
LINE 14: boon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shall dub
LINE 15: me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms in
LINE 16: the chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will be
LINE 17: accomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam
LINE 18: through all the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf
LINE 19: of those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant
LINE 20: like myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds."
LINE 21: The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and
LINE 22: had already some suspicion of his guest's want of wits, was quite
LINE 23: convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make
LINE 24: sport for the night he determined to fall in with his humour. So he
LINE 25: told him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and
LINE 26: that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as
LINE 27: distinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing showed him to be;
LINE 28: and that he himself in his younger days had followed the same
LINE 29: honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventures in various parts of
LINE 30: the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of
LINE 31: Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, the
LINE 32: Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of San Lucar,
LINE 33: the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters,
LINE 34: where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightness of his
LINE 35: fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and
LINE 36: swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of
LINE 37: almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he
LINE 38: had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his
LINE 39: property and upon that of others; and where he received all
LINE 40: knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the
LINE 41: great love he bore them and that they might share their substance with
LINE 42: him in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this
LINE 43: castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour,
LINE 44: as it had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case
LINE 45: of necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch
LINE 46: it that night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God
LINE 47: willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him
LINE 48: dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so.
LINE 49: He asked if he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied
LINE 50: that he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he
LINE 51: had never read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord
LINE 52: told him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories,
LINE 53: because in the author's opinion there was no need to mention anything
LINE 54: so obvious and necessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be
LINE 55: supposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard it
LINE 56: as certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there
LINE 57: were so many full and unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished
LINE 58: purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little
LINE 59: box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For in those plains
LINE 60: and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded, it was
LINE 61: not always that there was someone to cure them, unless indeed they had
LINE 62: for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once by fetching
LINE 63: through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water
LINE 64: of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their
LINE 65: hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had not
LINE 66: received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the
LINE 67: knights of old took care to see that their squires were provided with
LINE 68: money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing
LINE 69: purposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which was
LINE 70: rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything in
LINE 71: cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's croup, as if
LINE 72: it were something else of more importance, because, unless for some
LINE 73: such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded
LINE 74: among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so
LINE 75: soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time forth to
LINE 76: travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find the
LINE 77: advantage of them when he least expected it.
LINE 78: Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was
LINE 79: arranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at
LINE 80: one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed
LINE 81: it on a trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his
LINE 82: buckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to
LINE 83: march up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his march
LINE 84: night began to fall.
LINE 85: The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of
LINE 86: his guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he
LINE 87: contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they
LINE 88: flocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he
LINE 89: sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed
LINE 90: on his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as
LINE 91: the night closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it
LINE 92: might vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was
LINE 93: plainly seen by all.
LINE 94: Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water
LINE 95: his team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote's armour as it lay
LINE 96: on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud
LINE 97: voice, "O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands
LINE 98: on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have
LINE 99: a care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy
LINE 100: life as the penalty of thy rashness." The carrier gave no heed to these
LINE 101: words (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been
LINE 102: heedful of his health), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour
LINE 103: some distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to
LINE 104: heaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea,
LINE 105: exclaimed, "Aid me, lady mine, in this the first encounter that
LINE 106: presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let
LINE 107: not thy favour and protection fail me in this first jeopardy;" and,
LINE 108: with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler
LINE 109: he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on
LINE 110: the carrier's head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunned that
LINE 111: had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a
LINE 112: surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to
LINE 113: his beat with the same serenity as before.

LINE 116: Shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the
LINE 117: carrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water
LINE 118: to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear
LINE 119: the trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid
LINE 120: from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his
LINE 121: lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier's head into
LINE 122: pieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the
LINE 123: noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the
LINE 124: landlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and
LINE 125: with his hand on his sword exclaimed, "O Lady of Beauty, strength and
LINE 126: support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy
LINE 127: greatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an
LINE 128: adventure." By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have
LINE 129: flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The
LINE 130: comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a
LINE 131: distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best
LINE 132: he could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his
LINE 133: armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone,
LINE 134: for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would
LINE 135: not be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don
LINE 136: Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle,
LINE 137: who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and
LINE 138: a low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he
LINE 139: would call to account for his treachery. "But of you," he cried, "base
LINE 140: and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye
LINE 141: can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and
LINE 142: insolence will be." This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness
LINE 143: that he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for
LINE 144: this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning
LINE 145: him, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same
LINE 146: calmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.
LINE 147: But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the
LINE 148: landlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at
LINE 149: once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure
LINE 150: could occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,
LINE 151: without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people,
LINE 152: who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had
LINE 153: already told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was
LINE 154: it needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the
LINE 155: ceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay
LINE 156: in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be
LINE 157: administered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all
LINE 158: that was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were
LINE 159: satisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than
LINE 160: four about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there
LINE 161: ready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as
LINE 162: possible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed
LINE 163: knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle,
LINE 164: except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.
LINE 165: Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in
LINE 166: which he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the
LINE 167: carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels
LINE 168: already mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him
LINE 169: kneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating
LINE 170: some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand
LINE 171: and gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a
LINE 172: smart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth
LINE 173: as if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of
LINE 174: the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great
LINE 175: self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a
LINE 176: burst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had
LINE 177: already seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter within
LINE 178: bounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, "May
LINE 179: God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in
LINE 180: battle." Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that
LINE 181: time forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had
LINE 182: received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he
LINE 183: acquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that
LINE 184: she was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of
LINE 185: Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she
LINE 186: might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said
LINE 187: in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed
LINE 188: the "Don" and called herself Doña Tolosa. She promised she would, and
LINE 189: then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the
LINE 190: same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and
LINE 191: she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a
LINE 192: respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote
LINE 193: requested that she would adopt the "Don" and call herself Doña
LINE 194: Molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.
LINE 195: Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these
LINE 196: never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw
LINE 197: himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and
LINE 198: saddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he
LINE 199: returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in
LINE 200: language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it
LINE 201: or report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no
LINE 202: less rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him
LINE 203: to pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.
