LINE 3: He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best
LINE 4: he could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that
LINE 5: came from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire;
LINE 6: and though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be
LINE 7: transferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as
LINE 8: the goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the
LINE 9: ground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty
LINE 10: good-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins six
LINE 11: of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with
LINE 12: rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which
LINE 13: they placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho
LINE 14: remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him
LINE 15: standing, his master said to him:
LINE 16: "That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains
LINE 17: in itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road
LINE 18: to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou
LINE 19: seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people,
LINE 20: and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and
LINE 21: that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for
LINE 22: the same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels
LINE 23: all."
LINE 24: "Great thanks," said Sancho, "but I may tell your worship that provided
LINE 25: I have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by
LINE 26: myself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth
LINE 27: is to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much
LINE 28: more relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the
LINE 29: turkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink
LINE 30: little, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I
LINE 31: want or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and
LINE 32: solitude. So, señor, as for these honours which your worship would put
LINE 33: upon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for
LINE 34: other things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these,
LINE 35: though I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this
LINE 36: moment to the end of the world."
LINE 37: "For all that," said Don Quixote, "thou must seat thyself, because him
LINE 38: who humbleth himself God exalteth;" and seizing him by the arm he
LINE 39: forced him to sit down beside himself.
LINE 40: The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and
LINE 41: knights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at
LINE 42: their guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away
LINE 43: pieces as big as one's fist. The course of meat finished, they spread
LINE 44: upon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they
LINE 45: put down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All
LINE 46: this while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now
LINE 47: full, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained
LINE 48: one of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had
LINE 49: quite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and
LINE 50: contemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this
LINE 51: fashion:
LINE 52: "Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of
LINE 53: golden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this
LINE 54: our iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it
LINE 55: knew not the two words "_mine_" and "_thine_"! In that blessed age all
LINE 56: things were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of
LINE 57: any save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks
LINE 58: that stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The
LINE 59: clear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in
LINE 60: noble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in
LINE 61: the clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without
LINE 62: usance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The
LINE 63: mighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the
LINE 64: broad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by
LINE 65: rude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then
LINE 66: all was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of
LINE 67: the crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels
LINE 68: of our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion
LINE 69: of her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight
LINE 70: the children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and
LINE 71: fair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with
LINE 72: flowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover
LINE 73: what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments
LINE 74: like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured
LINE 75: in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,
LINE 76: wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames
LINE 77: with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has
LINE 78: taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves
LINE 79: simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend
LINE 80: themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice
LINE 81: had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her
LINE 82: ground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of
LINE 83: interest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary
LINE 84: law had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then
LINE 85: there was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and
LINE 86: modesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without
LINE 87: fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were
LINE 88: undone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful
LINE 89: age of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of
LINE 90: Crete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry
LINE 91: will make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of
LINE 92: its accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to
LINE 93: ruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased,
LINE 94: the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to
LINE 95: protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order
LINE 96: I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the
LINE 97: hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by
LINE 98: natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet,
LINE 99: seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and
LINE 100: feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I
LINE 101: should thank you for yours."

LINE 104: All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our
LINE 105: knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the
LINE 106: golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary
LINE 107: argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement
LINE 108: without saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate
LINE 109: acorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they
LINE 110: had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.
LINE 111: Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the
LINE 112: end of which one of the goatherds said, "That your worship, señor
LINE 113: knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality
LINE 114: with ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making
LINE 115: one of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very
LINE 116: intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and
LINE 117: write and play on the rebeck to perfection."
LINE 118: The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck
LINE 119: reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very
LINE 120: good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him
LINE 121: if he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already
LINE 122: made the offer said to him:
LINE 123: "In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of
LINE 124: singing a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in
LINE 125: the mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy
LINE 126: accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say
LINE 127: true; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy
LINE 128: love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much
LINE 129: liked in the town."
LINE 130: "With all my heart," said the young man, and without waiting for more
LINE 131: pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his
LINE 132: rebeck, presently began to sing to these words.
LINE 133: ANTONIO'S BALLAD
LINE 134: Thou dost love me well, Olalla;
LINE 135: Well I know it, even though
LINE 136: Love's mute tongues, thine eyes, have never
LINE 137: By their glances told me so.
LINE 138: For I know my love thou knowest,
LINE 139: Therefore thine to claim I dare:
LINE 140: Once it ceases to be secret,
LINE 141: Love need never feel despair.
LINE 142: True it is, Olalla, sometimes
LINE 143: Thou hast all too plainly shown
LINE 144: That thy heart is brass in hardness,
LINE 145: And thy snowy bosom stone.
LINE 146: Yet for all that, in thy coyness,
LINE 147: And thy fickle fits between,
LINE 148: Hope is there—at least the border
LINE 149: Of her garment may be seen.
LINE 150: Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,
LINE 151: And to faith in thee I hold;
LINE 152: Kindness cannot make it stronger,
LINE 153: Coldness cannot make it cold.
LINE 154: If it be that love is gentle,
LINE 155: In thy gentleness I see
LINE 156: Something holding out assurance
LINE 157: To the hope of winning thee.
LINE 158: If it be that in devotion
LINE 159: Lies a power hearts to move,
LINE 160: That which every day I show thee,
LINE 161: Helpful to my suit should prove.
LINE 162: Many a time thou must have noticed—
LINE 163: If to notice thou dost care—
LINE 164: How I go about on Monday
LINE 165: Dressed in all my Sunday wear.
LINE 166: Love's eyes love to look on brightness;
LINE 167: Love loves what is gaily drest;
LINE 168: Sunday, Monday, all I care is
LINE 169: Thou shouldst see me in my best.
LINE 170: No account I make of dances,
LINE 171: Or of strains that pleased thee so,
LINE 172: Keeping thee awake from midnight
LINE 173: Till the cocks began to crow;
LINE 174: Or of how I roundly swore it
LINE 175: That there's none so fair as thou;
LINE 176: True it is, but as I said it,
LINE 177: By the girls I'm hated now.
LINE 178: For Teresa of the hillside
LINE 179: At my praise of thee was sore;
LINE 180: Said, "You think you love an angel;
LINE 181: It's a monkey you adore;
LINE 182: "Caught by all her glittering trinkets,
LINE 183: And her borrowed braids of hair,
LINE 184: And a host of made-up beauties
LINE 185: That would Love himself ensnare."
LINE 186: 'Twas a lie, and so I told her,
LINE 187: And her cousin at the word
LINE 188: Gave me his defiance for it;
LINE 189: And what followed thou hast heard.
LINE 190: Mine is no high-flown affection,
LINE 191: Mine no passion _par amours_—
LINE 192: As they call it—what I offer
LINE 193: Is an honest love, and pure.
LINE 194: Cunning cords the holy Church has,
LINE 195: Cords of softest silk they be;
LINE 196: Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;
LINE 197: Mine will follow, thou wilt see.
LINE 198: Else—and once for all I swear it
LINE 199: By the saint of most renown—
LINE 200: If I ever quit the mountains,
LINE 201: 'Twill be in a friar's gown.
LINE 202: Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote
LINE 203: entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more
LINE 204: inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his
LINE 205: master, "Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to
LINE 206: pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not
LINE 207: allow them to spend the night in singing."
LINE 208: "I understand thee, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "I perceive clearly
LINE 209: that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather
LINE 210: than in music."
LINE 211: "It's sweet to us all, blessed be God," said Sancho.
LINE 212: "I do not deny it," replied Don Quixote; "but settle thyself where thou
LINE 213: wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than
LINE 214: in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear
LINE 215: for me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need."
LINE 216: Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,
LINE 217: told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it
LINE 218: would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which
LINE 219: there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a
LINE 220: little salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a
LINE 221: bandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so
LINE 222: it proved.
