LINE 3: To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how
LINE 4: his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how
LINE 5: the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant
LINE 6: into Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally
LINE 7: unconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to
LINE 8: persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream;
LINE 9: Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda's thoughts ran in
LINE 10: the same direction. Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour
LINE 11: shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth
LINE 12: in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name
LINE 13: and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of
LINE 14: contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated
LINE 15: and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound
LINE 16: reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good
LINE 17: fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour
LINE 18: was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had
LINE 19: given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained
LINE 20: through Don Quixote's means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the
LINE 21: only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long
LINE 22: face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:
LINE 23: "Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as
LINE 24: you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or
LINE 25: restoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled
LINE 26: now."
LINE 27: "I should think it was," replied Don Quixote, "for I have had the most
LINE 28: prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember
LINE 29: having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke—swish!—I
LINE 30: brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth
LINE 31: from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water."
LINE 32: "Like red wine, your worship had better say," replied Sancho; "for I
LINE 33: would have you know, if you don't know it, that the dead giant is a
LINE 34: hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine
LINE 35: that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore
LINE 36: me; and the devil take it all."
LINE 37: "What art thou talking about, fool?" said Don Quixote; "art thou in thy
LINE 38: senses?"
LINE 39: "Let your worship get up," said Sancho, "and you will see the nice
LINE 40: business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see
LINE 41: the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things
LINE 42: that will astonish you, if you understand them."
LINE 43: "I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind," returned Don
LINE 44: Quixote; "for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told
LINE 45: thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment,
LINE 46: and it would be no wonder if it were the same now."
LINE 47: "I could believe all that," replied Sancho, "if my blanketing was the
LINE 48: same sort of thing also; only it wasn't, but real and genuine; for I
LINE 49: saw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket
LINE 50: and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as
LINE 51: much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing
LINE 52: people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no
LINE 53: enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad
LINE 54: luck."
LINE 55: "Well, well, God will give a remedy," said Don Quixote; "hand me my
LINE 56: clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and
LINE 57: things thou speakest of."
LINE 58: Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate
LINE 59: gave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote's
LINE 60: madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from
LINE 61: that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his
LINE 62: lady's scorn. He described to them also nearly all the adventures that
LINE 63: Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little,
LINE 64: thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy
LINE 65: intellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady
LINE 66: Dorothea's good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their
LINE 67: purpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of
LINE 68: getting him home.
LINE 69: Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested
LINE 70: that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea's part sufficiently well.
LINE 71: "No," said Don Fernando, "that must not be, for I want Dorothea to
LINE 72: follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman's village is
LINE 73: not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his
LINE 74: relief."
LINE 75: "It is not more than two days' journey from this," said the curate.
LINE 76: "Even if it were more," said Don Fernando, "I would gladly travel so
LINE 77: far for the sake of doing so good a work."
LINE 78: At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino's
LINE 79: helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and
LINE 80: leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled
LINE 81: Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean
LINE 82: yellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the
LINE 83: solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he
LINE 84: would say, and he, fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her
LINE 85: with great gravity and composure:
LINE 86: "I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has
LINE 87: been annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady
LINE 88: of high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private
LINE 89: maiden. If this has been done by the command of the magician king your
LINE 90: father, through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and
LINE 91: are entitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know half
LINE 92: the mass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he
LINE 93: had read and gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I
LINE 94: have, he would have found at every turn that knights of less renown
LINE 95: than mine have accomplished things more difficult: it is no great
LINE 96: matter to kill a whelp of a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it
LINE 97: is not many hours since I myself was engaged with one, and—I will not
LINE 98: speak of it, that they may not say I am lying; time, however, that
LINE 99: reveals all, will tell the tale when we least expect it."
LINE 100: "You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant," said
LINE 101: the landlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue and
LINE 102: on no account interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, "I say in
LINE 103: conclusion, high and disinherited lady, that if your father has brought
LINE 104: about this metamorphosis in your person for the reason I have
LINE 105: mentioned, you ought not to attach any importance to it; for there is
LINE 106: no peril on earth through which my sword will not force a way, and with
LINE 107: it, before many days are over, I will bring your enemy's head to the
LINE 108: ground and place on yours the crown of your kingdom."
LINE 109: Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, who
LINE 110: aware of Don Fernando's determination to carry on the deception until
LINE 111: Don Quixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of manner
LINE 112: and gravity made answer, "Whoever told you, valiant Knight of the
LINE 113: Rueful Countenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation
LINE 114: did not tell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It is
LINE 115: true that certain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than
LINE 116: I could have hoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not
LINE 117: therefore ceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same
LINE 118: desire I have had all through of availing myself of the might of your
LINE 119: valiant and invincible arm. And so, señor, let your goodness reinstate
LINE 120: the father that begot me in your good opinion, and be assured that he
LINE 121: was a wise and prudent man, since by his craft he found out such a sure
LINE 122: and easy way of remedying my misfortune; for I believe, señor, that had
LINE 123: it not been for you I should never have lit upon the good fortune I now
LINE 124: possess; and in this I am saying what is perfectly true; as most of
LINE 125: these gentlemen who are present can fully testify. All that remains is
LINE 126: to set out on our journey to-morrow, for to-day we could not make much
LINE 127: way; and for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to, I
LINE 128: trust to God and the valour of your heart."
LINE 129: So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned
LINE 130: to Sancho, and said to him, with an angry air, "I declare now, little
LINE 131: Sancho, thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and
LINE 132: vagabond, hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been
LINE 133: turned into a maiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I am
LINE 134: persuaded I cut off from a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and
LINE 135: other nonsense that put me in the greatest perplexity I have ever been
LINE 136: in all my life? I vow" (and here he looked to heaven and ground his
LINE 137: teeth) "I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way that
LINE 138: will teach sense for the future to all lying squires of knights-errant
LINE 139: in the world."
LINE 140: "Let your worship be calm, señor," returned Sancho, "for it may well be
LINE 141: that I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princess
LINE 142: Micomicona; but as to the giant's head, or at least as to the piercing
LINE 143: of the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as
LINE 144: sure as there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head
LINE 145: of your worship's bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not
LINE 146: you will see when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship
LINE 147: the landlord calls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily
LINE 148: glad that her ladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as
LINE 149: much as anyone."
LINE 150: "I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool," said Don Quixote;
LINE 151: "forgive me, and that will do."
LINE 152: "That will do," said Don Fernando; "let us say no more about it; and as
LINE 153: her ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is
LINE 154: too late to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasant
LINE 155: conversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Señor Don Quixote;
LINE 156: for we wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is
LINE 157: about to perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he has
LINE 158: undertaken."
LINE 159: "It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you," said Don Quixote; "and
LINE 160: I am much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the
LINE 161: good opinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it
LINE 162: shall cost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more."
LINE 163: Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passed
LINE 164: between Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end
LINE 165: by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from
LINE 166: his attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors,
LINE 167: for he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with
LINE 168: half-sleeves and without a collar; his breeches were also of blue
LINE 169: cloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and
LINE 170: had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast. Behind
LINE 171: him, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in Moorish
LINE 172: fashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and wearing a
LINE 173: little brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders
LINE 174: to her feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, in
LINE 175: age a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with long
LINE 176: moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his appearance was such
LINE 177: that if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a person
LINE 178: of quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a room, and when
LINE 179: they told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed, and
LINE 180: approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he took her down
LINE 181: from the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her
LINE 182: daughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely
LINE 183: new costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,
LINE 184: courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who
LINE 185: had brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, "Do
LINE 186: not be put out, señora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here,
LINE 187: for it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you
LINE 188: will be pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda)
LINE 189: perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your
LINE 190: journey."
LINE 191: To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from her
LINE 192: seat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending
LINE 193: her body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they
LINE 194: concluded that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian
LINE 195: tongue.
LINE 196: At this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise
LINE 197: engaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that
LINE 198: she made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, "Ladies, this
LINE 199: damsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of
LINE 200: her own country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what
LINE 201: has been asked of her."
LINE 202: "Nothing has been asked of her," returned Luscinda; "she has only been
LINE 203: offered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we
LINE 204: occupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances
LINE 205: allow, with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand
LINE 206: in need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is
LINE 207: rendered."
LINE 208: "On her part and my own, señora," replied the captive, "I kiss your
LINE 209: hands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered,
LINE 210: which, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance,
LINE 211: is, it is plain to see, a very great one."
LINE 212: "Tell me, señor," said Dorothea, "is this lady a Christian or a Moor?
LINE 213: for her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we
LINE 214: could wish she was not."
LINE 215: "In dress and outwardly," said he, "she is a Moor, but at heart she is
LINE 216: a thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become
LINE 217: one."
LINE 218: "Then she has not been baptised?" returned Luscinda.
LINE 219: "There has been no opportunity for that," replied the captive, "since
LINE 220: she left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present
LINE 221: she has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to
LINE 222: make it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all
LINE 223: the ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere
LINE 224: long she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is
LINE 225: higher than her dress or mine indicates."
LINE 226: By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who
LINE 227: the Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just
LINE 228: then, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest
LINE 229: themselves than for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took
LINE 230: the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself,
LINE 231: requested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to
LINE 232: ask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her in
LINE 233: Arabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she
LINE 234: removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she
LINE 235: seemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful
LINE 236: than Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could
LINE 237: compare with theirs it was the Moorish lady's, and there were even
LINE 238: those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as it
LINE 239: is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure
LINE 240: good-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to
LINE 241: the lovely Moor.
LINE 242: Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that
LINE 243: it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what
LINE 244: the Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and
LINE 245: energy, "No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!" giving them to understand that
LINE 246: she was called "Maria" and not "Zoraida." These words, and the touching
LINE 247: earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from
LINE 248: some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature
LINE 249: tender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately,
LINE 250: saying, "Yes, yes, Maria, Maria," to which the Moor replied, "Yes, yes,
LINE 251: Maria; Zoraida macange," which means "not Zoraida."
LINE 252: Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied
LINE 253: Don Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them
LINE 254: the best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having
LINE 255: arrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one,
LINE 256: for round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of
LINE 257: honour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned
LINE 258: to Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his
LINE 259: side, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places
LINE 260: next her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the
LINE 261: captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the
LINE 262: curate and the barber. And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was
LINE 263: increased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved
LINE 264: by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length
LINE 265: when he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them:
LINE 266: "Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the
LINE 267: things they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry.
LINE 268: Say, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this
LINE 269: castle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or
LINE 270: imagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is
LINE 271: beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am
LINE 272: that Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the
LINE 273: mouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling
LINE 274: surpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more
LINE 275: deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more
LINE 276: exposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the
LINE 277: preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that
LINE 278: they know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly
LINE 279: assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the
LINE 280: mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment
LINE 281: to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter's trade, for which
LINE 282: nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who
LINE 283: profess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the
LINE 284: execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of
LINE 285: the warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his
LINE 286: care, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whether
LINE 287: by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of
LINE 288: the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off
LINE 289: impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them
LINE 290: the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the
LINE 291: mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that
LINE 292: of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this
LINE 293: will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that
LINE 294: purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object.
LINE 295: The end and goal of letters—I am not speaking now of divine letters,
LINE 296: the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an
LINE 297: end so infinite no other can be compared—I speak of human letters, the
LINE 298: end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man
LINE 299: that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed:
LINE 300: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not
LINE 301: such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their
LINE 302: end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this
LINE 303: life. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which
LINE 304: the angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in
LINE 305: the air, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of
LINE 306: good-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and
LINE 307: earth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any
LINE 308: house, was to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he
LINE 309: said to them, 'My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be
LINE 310: with you;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a
LINE 311: jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in
LINE 312: heaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name
LINE 313: for arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and
LINE 314: that so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to
LINE 315: the bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of him who follows
LINE 316: the profession of arms, and see which are the greater."
LINE 317: Don Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such
LINE 318: correct language, that for the time being he made it impossible for any
LINE 319: of his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were
LINE 320: mostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they
LINE 321: listened to him with great pleasure as he continued: "Here, then, I say
LINE 322: is what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all
LINE 323: are poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have
LINE 324: said that he endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about
LINE 325: his hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good things of
LINE 326: life. This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or
LINE 327: nakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but
LINE 328: that he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat
LINE 329: unseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest
LINE 330: misery of the student is what they themselves call 'going out for
LINE 331: soup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for them,
LINE 332: which, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and
LINE 333: lastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not go
LINE 334: into other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no
LINE 335: superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging
LINE 336: themselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them
LINE 337: to a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough
LINE 338: and hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall
LINE 339: again, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have
LINE 340: seen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as
LINE 341: if borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I
LINE 342: say, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger turned
LINE 343: into satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine
LINE 344: raiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the
LINE 345: justly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with
LINE 346: what the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of
LINE 347: it, as I am now about to show."

LINE 349: CHAPTER XXXVIII.
LINE 350: WHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND
LINE 351: LETTERS
LINE 352: c38a.jpg (180K)
LINE 353: Full Size
LINE 354: Continuing his discourse Don Quixote said: "As we began in the
LINE 355: student's case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if
LINE 356: the soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there
LINE 357: is no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes
LINE 358: late or never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling
LINE 359: his life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great
LINE 360: that a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the
LINE 361: depth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the
LINE 362: weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his
LINE 363: mouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out
LINE 364: cold, contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward to
LINE 365: the approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed
LINE 366: that awaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by
LINE 367: being over narrow, for he can easily measure out on the ground as he
LINE 368: likes, and roll himself about in it to his heart's content without any
LINE 369: fear of the sheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this,
LINE 370: suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to have
LINE 371: come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him
LINE 372: with the doctor's cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps,
LINE 373: that has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm or
LINE 374: leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him
LINE 375: and keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty
LINE 376: he was in before, and he must go through more engagements and more
LINE 377: battles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; but
LINE 378: miracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have
LINE 379: ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war
LINE 380: fall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you
LINE 381: will reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be
LINE 382: numbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with
LINE 383: three figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters;
LINE 384: for by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of
LINE 385: support; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is
LINE 386: much less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to
LINE 387: reward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by
LINE 388: giving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their
LINE 389: calling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very
LINE 390: property of the master they serve; but this impossibility only
LINE 391: strengthens my argument.
LINE 392: "Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which
LINE 393: it is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of
LINE 394: arms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments
LINE 395: put forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters
LINE 396: say that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too,
LINE 397: has its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of
LINE 398: letters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them
LINE 399: laws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms
LINE 400: preserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;
LINE 401: and, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies,
LINE 402: cities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and
LINE 403: confusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to
LINE 404: make use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that
LINE 405: whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain
LINE 406: to eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness,
LINE 407: headaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I
LINE 408: have already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course
LINE 409: of things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and
LINE 410: in an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of
LINE 411: losing his life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or
LINE 412: harass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds
LINE 413: himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin
LINE 414: or cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post
LINE 415: where he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly
LINE 416: from the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform
LINE 417: his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a
LINE 418: counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the
LINE 419: moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into
LINE 420: the deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us
LINE 421: see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys
LINE 422: stem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one
LINE 423: with the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two
LINE 424: feet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him
LINE 425: threatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the
LINE 426: foe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too that
LINE 427: with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities
LINE 428: of Neptune's bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that
LINE 429: nerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and
LINE 430: struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship. And what is
LINE 431: still more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he
LINE 432: will never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his
LINE 433: place; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an
LINE 434: enemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment's pause
LINE 435: between their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the
LINE 436: chances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread
LINE 437: fury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am
LINE 438: persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention,
LINE 439: by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life
LINE 440: of a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in
LINE 441: the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave
LINE 442: hearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one
LINE 443: who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine,
LINE 444: which in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life
LINE 445: of one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect
LINE 446: on this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having
LINE 447: adopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we
LINE 448: live in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me
LINE 449: some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the
LINE 450: opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known
LINE 451: earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven's
LINE 452: will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more
LINE 453: honoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of
LINE 454: yore exposed themselves to."
LINE 455: All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others
LINE 456: supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more
LINE 457: than once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough
LINE 458: afterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had
LINE 459: heard him to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational
LINE 460: views on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when
LINE 461: his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he
LINE 462: was quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that he
LINE 463: himself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same
LINE 464: opinion.
LINE 465: They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the
LINE 466: hostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La
LINE 467: Mancha's garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to
LINE 468: be quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the
LINE 469: captive to tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be
LINE 470: strange and interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his
LINE 471: arrival in company with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that he
LINE 472: would very willingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale
LINE 473: would not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to
LINE 474: be wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate and the others
LINE 475: thanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself so
LINE 476: pressed said there was no occasion to ask, where a command had such
LINE 477: weight, and added, "If your worships will give me your attention you
LINE 478: will hear a true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with
LINE 479: ingenious and studied art cannot come up to." These words made them
LINE 480: settle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence, and he
LINE 481: seeing them waiting on his words in mute expectation, began thus in a
LINE 482: pleasant quiet voice.
