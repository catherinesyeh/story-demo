LINE 3: When Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way,
LINE 4: he said, "Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never
LINE 5: yet have I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted
LINE 6: knights-errant in this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy,
LINE 7: sluggish animals promise; for they always take them away through the
LINE 8: air with marvellous swiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a
LINE 9: chariot of fire, or it may be on some hippogriff or other beast of the
LINE 10: kind; but to carry me off like this on an ox-cart! By God, it puzzles
LINE 11: me! But perhaps the chivalry and enchantments of our day take a
LINE 12: different course from that of those in days gone by; and it may be,
LINE 13: too, that as I am a new knight in the world, and the first to revive
LINE 14: the already forgotten calling of knight-adventurers, they may have
LINE 15: newly invented other kinds of enchantments and other modes of carrying
LINE 16: off the enchanted. What thinkest thou of the matter, Sancho my son?"

LINE 19: "I don't know what to think," answered Sancho, "not being as well read
LINE 20: as your worship in errant writings; but for all that I venture to say
LINE 21: and swear that these apparitions that are about us are not quite
LINE 22: catholic."
LINE 23: "Catholic!" said Don Quixote. "Father of me! how can they be Catholic
LINE 24: when they are all devils that have taken fantastic shapes to come and
LINE 25: do this, and bring me to this condition? And if thou wouldst prove it,
LINE 26: touch them, and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of
LINE 27: air, and no consistency except in appearance."
LINE 28: "By God, master," returned Sancho, "I have touched them already; and
LINE 29: that devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and
LINE 30: another property very different from what I have heard say devils have,
LINE 31: for by all accounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells;
LINE 32: but this one smells of amber half a league off." Sancho was here
LINE 33: speaking of Don Fernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very
LINE 34: likely perfumed as Sancho said.
LINE 35: "Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend," said Don Quixote; "for let me
LINE 36: tell thee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about
LINE 37: with them, they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or,
LINE 38: if they have any smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of
LINE 39: something foul and fetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell
LINE 40: with them wherever they go, and can get no ease whatever from their
LINE 41: torments, and as a sweet smell is a thing that gives pleasure and
LINE 42: enjoyment, it is impossible that they can smell sweet; if, then, this
LINE 43: devil thou speakest of seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou art
LINE 44: deceiving thyself, or he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he
LINE 45: is not a devil."
LINE 46: Such was the conversation that passed between master and man; and Don
LINE 47: Fernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho's making a complete
LINE 48: discovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,
LINE 49: resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside,
LINE 50: they directed him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on
LINE 51: Sancho's ass, which he did with great alacrity. In the meantime the
LINE 52: curate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear
LINE 53: them company as far as his village, he paying them so much a day.
LINE 54: Cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante's saddle
LINE 55: and the basin on the other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his
LINE 56: ass and take Rocinante's bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed
LINE 57: two officers with their muskets; but before the cart was put in motion,
LINE 58: out came the landlady and her daughter and Maritornes to bid Don
LINE 59: Quixote farewell, pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune; and
LINE 60: to them Don Quixote said:
LINE 61: "Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who
LINE 62: follow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall
LINE 63: me I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things
LINE 64: never happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in
LINE 65: the world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are
LINE 66: envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights
LINE 67: who compass the destruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless,
LINE 68: virtue is of herself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that
LINE 69: Zoroaster its first inventor knew, she will come victorious out of
LINE 70: every trial, and shed her light upon the earth as the sun does upon the
LINE 71: heavens. Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in
LINE 72: aught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done
LINE 73: so to any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to
LINE 74: which some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I find
LINE 75: myself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in
LINE 76: this castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge,
LINE 77: recognise, and requite them as they deserve."
LINE 78: While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don
LINE 79: Quixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and
LINE 80: his companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all
LINE 81: made happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all
LINE 82: embraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things
LINE 83: went with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to
LINE 84: him, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there
LINE 85: was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and
LINE 86: that he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought
LINE 87: he would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida's baptism, Don
LINE 88: Luis's affair, and Luscinda's return to her home. The curate promised
LINE 89: to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and
LINE 90: renewed their promises.
LINE 91: The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying
LINE 92: he had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel
LINE 93: of "The Ill-advised Curiosity" had been found, and that he might take
LINE 94: them all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as
LINE 95: he could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked
LINE 96: him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the
LINE 97: words, "Novel of Rinconete and Cortadillo," by which he perceived that
LINE 98: it was a novel, and as that of "The Ill-advised Curiosity" had been
LINE 99: good he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by
LINE 100: the same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an
LINE 101: opportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same,
LINE 102: both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out
LINE 103: following in the rear of the cart. The order of march was this: first
LINE 104: went the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the
LINE 105: officers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then
LINE 106: followed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and
LINE 107: behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, with
LINE 108: faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring
LINE 109: their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen. Don Quixote was seated
LINE 110: in the cage, with his hands tied and his feet stretched out, leaning
LINE 111: against the bars as silent and as patient as if he were a stone statue
LINE 112: and not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently they made, it might
LINE 113: be, two leagues, until they reached a valley which the carter thought a
LINE 114: convenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and he said so to
LINE 115: the curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought to push on a
LINE 116: little farther, as at the other side of a hill which appeared close by
LINE 117: he knew there was a valley that had more grass and much better than the
LINE 118: one where they proposed to halt; and his advice was taken and they
LINE 119: continued their journey.
LINE 120: Just at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind them
LINE 121: six or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook
LINE 122: them, for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of
LINE 123: oxen, but like men who rode canons' mules, and in haste to take their
LINE 124: noontide rest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a
LINE 125: league off. The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous
LINE 126: salutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in
LINE 127: fact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him,
LINE 128: observing the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers,
LINE 129: Sancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote
LINE 130: caged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of
LINE 131: carrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of the
LINE 132: officers, he already concluded that he must be some desperate
LINE 133: highwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within the
LINE 134: jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom he
LINE 135: had put the question, replied, "Let the gentleman himself tell you the
LINE 136: meaning of his going this way, señor, for we do not know."
LINE 137: Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, "Haply, gentlemen, you
LINE 138: are versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you
LINE 139: are I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my
LINE 140: giving myself the trouble of relating them;" but here the curate and
LINE 141: the barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation
LINE 142: with Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to
LINE 143: save their stratagem from being discovered.
LINE 144: The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, "In truth, brother, I know
LINE 145: more about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando's elements of
LINE 146: logic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please."
LINE 147: "In God's name, then, señor," replied Don Quixote; "if that be so, I
LINE 148: would have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy
LINE 149: and fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the
LINE 150: wicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of
LINE 151: those whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her
LINE 152: record, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and
LINE 153: all the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists
LINE 154: that Ethiopia ever produced, will place their names in the temple of
LINE 155: immortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come,
LINE 156: whereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread
LINE 157: if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms."
LINE 158: "What Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha says," observed the curate, "is
LINE 159: the truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or
LINE 160: sins of his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is
LINE 161: odious and valour hateful. This, señor, is the Knight of the Rueful
LINE 162: Countenance, if you have ever heard him named, whose valiant
LINE 163: achievements and mighty deeds shall be written on lasting brass and
LINE 164: imperishable marble, notwithstanding all the efforts of envy to obscure
LINE 165: them and malice to hide them."
LINE 166: When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty
LINE 167: talk in such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his
LINE 168: astonishment, and could not make out what had befallen him; and all his
LINE 169: attendants were in the same state of amazement.
LINE 170: At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the
LINE 171: conversation, said, in order to make everything plain, "Well, sirs, you
LINE 172: may like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter
LINE 173: is, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He
LINE 174: is in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like
LINE 175: other men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that's
LINE 176: the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is
LINE 177: enchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people
LINE 178: neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don't stop him,
LINE 179: will talk more than thirty lawyers." Then turning to the curate he
LINE 180: exclaimed, "Ah, señor curate, señor curate! do you think I don't know
LINE 181: you? Do you think I don't guess and see the drift of these new
LINE 182: enchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face
LINE 183: is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide
LINE 184: your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where
LINE 185: there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the
LINE 186: devil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married
LINE 187: to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at
LINE 188: least; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my
LINE 189: master, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my
LINE 190: services. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts,
LINE 191: that the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that
LINE 192: those who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and
LINE 193: children, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their
LINE 194: father return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom,
LINE 195: they will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this, señor
LINE 196: curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your
LINE 197: ill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you
LINE 198: to account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way,
LINE 199: and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don
LINE 200: Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up.
LINE 201: "Trim those lamps there!" exclaimed the barber at this; "so you are of
LINE 202: the same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see
LINE 203: that you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted
LINE 204: like him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an
LINE 205: evil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and
LINE 206: that island you long so much for found its way into your head."
LINE 207: "I am not with child by anyone," returned Sancho, "nor am I a man to
LINE 208: let myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I
LINE 209: am poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I
LINE 210: long for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son
LINE 211: of his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say
LINE 212: governor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he
LINE 213: will not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber;
LINE 214: for shaving is not everything, and there is some difference between
LINE 215: Peter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and it
LINE 216: will not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of
LINE 217: my master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it
LINE 218: worse to stir it."
LINE 219: The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he
LINE 220: should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to
LINE 221: conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon
LINE 222: to ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery
LINE 223: of this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. The
LINE 224: canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with
LINE 225: attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of
LINE 226: Don Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the
LINE 227: beginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his
LINE 228: adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan
LINE 229: they had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover
LINE 230: a cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew
LINE 231: when they heard Don Quixote's strange story, and when it was finished
LINE 232: he said, "To tell the truth, señor curate, I for my part consider what
LINE 233: they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though,
LINE 234: led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all
LINE 235: that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them
LINE 236: from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the
LINE 237: same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more
LINE 238: than that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of
LINE 239: the same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical
LINE 240: tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly
LINE 241: the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the
LINE 242: same time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to
LINE 243: amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of
LINE 244: such monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come
LINE 245: from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the
LINE 246: things that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing
LINE 247: that has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.
LINE 248: What beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of
LINE 249: the whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of
LINE 250: sixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of
LINE 251: him as if he was an almond cake? And when they want to give us a
LINE 252: picture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of
LINE 253: combatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be
LINE 254: opposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or
LINE 255: not, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his
LINE 256: strong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a
LINE 257: born queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some
LINE 258: unknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and
LINE 259: uncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of
LINE 260: knights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and
LINE 261: will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of
LINE 262: Prester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described
LINE 263: nor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that the
LINE 264: authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are
LINE 265: not bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is
LINE 266: all the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more
LINE 267: pleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots
LINE 268: in fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be
LINE 269: constructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing
LINE 270: over difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise,
LINE 271: interest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may
LINE 272: keep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect who
LINE 273: shuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection
LINE 274: of writing. I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts
LINE 275: together a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the
LINE 276: middle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning and
LINE 277: middle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude of
LINE 278: members that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or
LINE 279: monster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all this
LINE 280: they are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,
LINE 281: licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix
LINE 282: in their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels,
LINE 283: and, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which
LINE 284: reason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a
LINE 285: worthless breed."

LINE 288: The curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of
LINE 289: sound understanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; so
LINE 290: he told him that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a
LINE 291: grudge to books of chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote's, which
LINE 292: were many; and gave him an account of the scrutiny he had made of them,
LINE 293: and of those he had condemned to the flames and those he had spared,
LINE 294: with which the canon was not a little amused, adding that though he had
LINE 295: said so much in condemnation of these books, still he found one good
LINE 296: thing in them, and that was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted
LINE 297: intellect for displaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious
LINE 298: field over which the pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks,
LINE 299: tempests, combats, battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the
LINE 300: qualifications requisite to make one, showing him sagacious in
LINE 301: foreseeing the wiles of the enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or
LINE 302: restrain his soldiers, ripe in counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in
LINE 303: biding his time as in pressing the attack; now picturing some sad
LINE 304: tragic incident, now some joyful and unexpected event; here a beauteous
LINE 305: lady, virtuous, wise, and modest; there a Christian knight, brave and
LINE 306: gentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart; there a courteous prince,
LINE 307: gallant and gracious; setting forth the devotion and loyalty of
LINE 308: vassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. "Or again," said he,
LINE 309: "the author may show himself to be an astronomer, or a skilled
LINE 310: cosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of state, and
LINE 311: sometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if he
LINE 312: likes. He can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of Æneas,
LINE 313: the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of
LINE 314: Sinon, the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the
LINE 315: boldness of Cæsar, the clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of
LINE 316: Zopyrus, the wisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties that serve
LINE 317: to make an illustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual,
LINE 318: again distributing them among many; and if this be done with charm of
LINE 319: style and ingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible,
LINE 320: he will assuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when
LINE 321: finished, will display such perfection and beauty that it will attain
LINE 322: the worthiest object any writing can seek, which, as I said before, is
LINE 323: to give instruction and pleasure combined; for the unrestricted range
LINE 324: of these books enables the author to show his powers, epic, lyric,
LINE 325: tragic, or comic, and all the moods the sweet and winning arts of poesy
LINE 326: and oratory are capable of; for the epic may be written in prose just
LINE 327: as well as in verse."
