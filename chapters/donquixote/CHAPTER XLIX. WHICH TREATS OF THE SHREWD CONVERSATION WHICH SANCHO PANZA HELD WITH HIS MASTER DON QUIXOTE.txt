LINE 3: "Aha, I have caught you," said Sancho; "this is what in my heart and
LINE 4: soul I was longing to know. Come now, señor, can you deny what is
LINE 5: commonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, 'I don't know
LINE 6: what ails so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor
LINE 7: gives a proper answer to any question; one would think he was
LINE 8: enchanted'? From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat,
LINE 9: or drink, or sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of—that
LINE 10: such persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your
LINE 11: worship has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is
LINE 12: anything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them."
LINE 13: "What thou sayest is true, Sancho," replied Don Quixote; "but I have
LINE 14: already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be
LINE 15: that in the course of time they have been changed one for another, and
LINE 16: that now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do,
LINE 17: though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw
LINE 18: inferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am
LINE 19: enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh
LINE 20: heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a
LINE 21: faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage,
LINE 22: defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need
LINE 23: and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and
LINE 24: protection."
LINE 25: "Still for all that," replied Sancho, "I say that, for your greater and
LINE 26: fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to
LINE 27: get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help,
LINE 28: and even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount
LINE 29: your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy
LINE 30: and dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for
LINE 31: adventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to
LINE 32: go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire,
LINE 33: I promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are
LINE 34: so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my
LINE 35: plan."
LINE 36: "I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho," said Don Quixote,
LINE 37: "and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will
LINE 38: obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art
LINE 39: in thy conception of my misfortune."
LINE 40: The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation
LINE 41: till they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the
LINE 42: barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter
LINE 43: at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the
LINE 44: pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not
LINE 45: enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like
LINE 46: his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage
LINE 47: for a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not be
LINE 48: as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required.
LINE 49: The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply with
LINE 50: his request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at
LINE 51: liberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could
LINE 52: ever find him again.
LINE 53: "I will answer for his not running away," said Sancho.
LINE 54: "And I also," said the canon, "especially if he gives me his word as a
LINE 55: knight not to leave us without our consent."
LINE 56: Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, "I give it;—moreover
LINE 57: one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for he
LINE 58: who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three
LINE 59: ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying."—And
LINE 60: that being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it would
LINE 61: be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he
LINE 62: protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless
LINE 63: they kept their distance.
LINE 64: The canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his
LINE 65: word and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was
LINE 66: to find himself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch
LINE 67: himself all over, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and
LINE 68: giving him a couple of slaps on the haunches said, "I still trust in
LINE 69: God and in his blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we
LINE 70: shall soon see ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy
LINE 71: master on thy back, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for
LINE 72: which God sent me into the world." And so saying, accompanied by
LINE 73: Sancho, he withdrew to a retired spot, from which he came back much
LINE 74: relieved and more eager than ever to put his squire's scheme into
LINE 75: execution.
LINE 76: The canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his
LINE 77: madness, and that in all his remarks and replies he should show such
LINE 78: excellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said,
LINE 79: when the subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion,
LINE 80: he said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival
LINE 81: of the provisions:
LINE 82: "Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of
LINE 83: books of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to
LINE 84: upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like,
LINE 85: all as far from the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any
LINE 86: human understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that
LINE 87: infinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous
LINE 88: knights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of
LINE 89: Hircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, and
LINE 90: monsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and enchantments of
LINE 91: every kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes,
LINE 92: love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters,
LINE 93: billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that
LINE 94: nonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that
LINE 95: when I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that they are all
LINE 96: lies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when
LINE 97: I come to consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the
LINE 98: wall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand, as
LINE 99: richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the
LINE 100: range of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes of
LINE 101: life, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept
LINE 102: as truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they
LINE 103: even dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence,
LINE 104: as is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they
LINE 105: have brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage
LINE 106: and carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from
LINE 107: place to place to make money by showing it. Come, Señor Don Quixote,
LINE 108: have some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense,
LINE 109: and make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to
LINE 110: bestow upon you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other
LINE 111: reading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your
LINE 112: honour. And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read
LINE 113: books of achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the
LINE 114: Holy Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as
LINE 115: true as they are heroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Cæsar,
LINE 116: Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan
LINE 117: Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a
LINE 118: Diego García de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a
LINE 119: Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds
LINE 120: will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with
LINE 121: delight and wonder. Here, Señor Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of
LINE 122: your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,
LINE 123: in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners,
LINE 124: brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the
LINE 125: honour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I
LINE 126: am informed, your worship derives your birth."
LINE 127: Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon's words,
LINE 128: and when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time,
LINE 129: he replied to him:
LINE 130: "It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship's discourse is
LINE 131: intended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the
LINE 132: world, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous
LINE 133: and useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them,
LINE 134: and worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I
LINE 135: undertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they
LINE 136: set forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of
LINE 137: Greece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full."
LINE 138: "It is all exactly as you state it," said the canon; to which Don
LINE 139: Quixote returned, "You also went on to say that books of this kind had
LINE 140: done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up
LINE 141: in a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my
LINE 142: studies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure
LINE 143: and instruction."
LINE 144: "Just so," said the canon.
LINE 145: "Well then," returned Don Quixote, "to my mind it is you who are the
LINE 146: one that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to
LINE 147: utter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and
LINE 148: accepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same
LINE 149: punishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you
LINE 150: when you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all
LINE 151: the other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never
LINE 152: existed, would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not
LINE 153: yield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world
LINE 154: can persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of
LINE 155: Burgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible,
LINE 156: which happened in the time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it
LINE 157: is as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a
LINE 158: lie too that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve
LINE 159: Peers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives changed into a
LINE 160: raven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just as
LINE 161: well try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the
LINE 162: quest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and
LINE 163: the Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and
LINE 164: Lancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seen
LINE 165: the Dame Quintañona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. And
LINE 166: so true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father's
LINE 167: side, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me,
LINE 168: 'Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintañona,' from which I conclude
LINE 169: that she must have known her, or at least had managed to see some
LINE 170: portrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the
LINE 171: fair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king's
LINE 172: armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse
LINE 173: he rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a
LINE 174: cart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca's saddle, and at Roncesvalles
LINE 175: there is Roland's horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer
LINE 176: that there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other
LINE 177: knights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or
LINE 178: perhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as
LINE 179: the valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the
LINE 180: city of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by
LINE 181: name, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de
LINE 182: Remesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour;
LINE 183: or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy,
LINE 184: by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose
LINE 185: family I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the sons
LINE 186: of the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de
LINE 187: Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged
LINE 188: in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of
LINE 189: Austria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quiñones, him of
LINE 190: the 'Paso,' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the
LINE 191: Castilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well
LINE 192: as many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign
LINE 193: realms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies
LINE 194: them must be totally wanting in reason and good sense."
LINE 195: The canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don
LINE 196: Quixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything
LINE 197: relating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he
LINE 198: said in reply:
LINE 199: "I cannot deny, Señor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you
LINE 200: say, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing
LINE 201: to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not
LINE 202: disposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop
LINE 203: Turpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they were
LINE 204: knights chosen by the kings of France, and called 'Peers' because they
LINE 205: were all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not
LINE 206: they ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like
LINE 207: those of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is
LINE 208: assumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and
LINE 209: good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of
LINE 210: Alcántara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because
LINE 211: twelve equals were chosen for that military order. That there was a
LINE 212: Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but that
LINE 213: they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. In
LINE 214: that other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, and
LINE 215: say is near Babieca's saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I am
LINE 216: either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the
LINE 217: saddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as
LINE 218: big as your worship says it is."
LINE 219: "For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt," said Don
LINE 220: Quixote; "and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of
LINE 221: cowhide to keep it from rusting."
LINE 222: "All that may be," replied the canon; "but, by the orders I have
LINE 223: received, I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there,
LINE 224: that is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those
LINE 225: Amadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor
LINE 226: is it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so
LINE 227: many good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, should
LINE 228: allow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are
LINE 229: written in those absurd books of chivalry are really true."
