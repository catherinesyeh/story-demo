LINE 3: Now by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of
LINE 4: the friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, Don
LINE 5: Quixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to
LINE 6: grant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to
LINE 7: make him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that the
LINE 8: struggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mount
LINE 9: Rocinante, he approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he
LINE 10: could mount, he went on his knees before him, and taking his hand,
LINE 11: kissed it saying, "May it please your worship, Señor Don Quixote, to
LINE 12: give me the government of that island which has been won in this hard
LINE 13: fight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to be
LINE 14: able to govern it as much and as well as anyone in the world who has
LINE 15: ever governed islands."
LINE 16: To which Don Quixote replied, "Thou must take notice, brother Sancho,
LINE 17: that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands,
LINE 18: but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an
LINE 19: ear the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves
LINE 20: from which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more."
LINE 21: Sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt
LINE 22: of his hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass
LINE 23: himself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without
LINE 24: taking leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the
LINE 25: coach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his
LINE 26: ass's best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left
LINE 27: behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don
LINE 28: Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up,
LINE 29: who on reaching him said, "It seems to me, señor, it would be prudent
LINE 30: in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he
LINE 31: with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give
LINE 32: information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and,
LINE 33: faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat
LINE 34: for it."
LINE 35: "Peace," said Don Quixote; "where hast thou ever seen or heard that a
LINE 36: knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however
LINE 37: many homicides he may have committed?"
LINE 38: "I know nothing about omecils," answered Sancho, "nor in my life have
LINE 39: had anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood
LINE 40: looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I
LINE 41: do not meddle."
LINE 42: "Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend," said Don Quixote,
LINE 43: "for I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more
LINE 44: out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou
LINE 45: seen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou
LINE 46: read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more
LINE 47: spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in
LINE 48: overthrowing?"
LINE 49: "The truth is," answered Sancho, "that I have never read any history,
LINE 50: for I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is
LINE 51: that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all
LINE 52: the days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for
LINE 53: where I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound,
LINE 54: for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some
LINE 55: lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas."
LINE 56: "All that might be well dispensed with," said Don Quixote, "if I had
LINE 57: remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and
LINE 58: medicine are saved by one single drop."
LINE 59: "What vial and what balsam is that?" said Sancho Panza.
LINE 60: "It is a balsam," answered Don Quixote, "the receipt of which I have in
LINE 61: my memory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of
LINE 62: any wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing
LINE 63: to do when in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through
LINE 64: the middle of the body—as is wont to happen frequently—but neatly and
LINE 65: with great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the
LINE 66: body which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half which
LINE 67: remains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly.
LINE 68: Then thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have
LINE 69: mentioned, and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple."
LINE 70: "If that be so," said Panza, "I renounce henceforth the government of
LINE 71: the promised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many and
LINE 72: faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this
LINE 73: supreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals
LINE 74: an ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in
LINE 75: ease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make
LINE 76: it."
LINE 77: "With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made," said Don
LINE 78: Quixote.
LINE 79: "Sinner that I am!" said Sancho, "then why does your worship put off
LINE 80: making it and teaching it to me?"
LINE 81: "Peace, friend," answered Don Quixote; "greater secrets I mean to teach
LINE 82: thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let
LINE 83: us see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish."
LINE 84: Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don
LINE 85: Quixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his
LINE 86: senses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to
LINE 87: heaven, he said, "I swear by the Creator of all things and the four
LINE 88: Gospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua
LINE 89: did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that
LINE 90: was not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and
LINE 91: other points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grant
LINE 92: as expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who has
LINE 93: committed such an offence against me."
LINE 94: Hearing this, Sancho said to him, "Your worship should bear in mind,
LINE 95: Señor Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him
LINE 96: in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will
LINE 97: have done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further
LINE 98: punishment unless he commits some new offence."
LINE 99: "Thou hast said well and hit the point," answered Don Quixote; and so I
LINE 100: recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,
LINE 101: but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such
LINE 102: time as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this
LINE 103: and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw
LINE 104: in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very
LINE 105: same thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino's helmet, which
LINE 106: cost Sacripante so dear."
LINE 107: "Señor," replied Sancho, "let your worship send all such oaths to the
LINE 108: devil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the
LINE 109: conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in
LINE 110: with no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be
LINE 111: observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to
LINE 112: sleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand
LINE 113: other mortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis
LINE 114: of Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your
LINE 115: worship observe that there are no men in armour travelling on any of
LINE 116: these roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear
LINE 117: helmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives."
LINE 118: "Thou art wrong there," said Don Quixote, "for we shall not have been
LINE 119: above two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in
LINE 120: armour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica."
LINE 121: "Enough," said Sancho; "so be it then, and God grant us success, and
LINE 122: that the time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may
LINE 123: soon come, and then let me die."
LINE 124: "I have already told thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "not to give
LINE 125: thyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail,
LINE 126: there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee
LINE 127: as a ring fits the finger, and all the more that, being on _terra
LINE 128: firma_, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that
LINE 129: to its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those
LINE 130: alforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we
LINE 131: may lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to
LINE 132: thee by God, this ear is giving me great pain."
LINE 133: "I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,"
LINE 134: said Sancho, "but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like
LINE 135: your worship."
LINE 136: "How little thou knowest about it," answered Don Quixote; "I would have
LINE 137: thee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go
LINE 138: without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should
LINE 139: be of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee
LINE 140: hadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very
LINE 141: many, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant
LINE 142: eating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for
LINE 143: them, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it
LINE 144: is plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other
LINE 145: natural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it
LINE 146: is plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives
LINE 147: through woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would
LINE 148: be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend
LINE 149: Sancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to
LINE 150: make a new world or pervert knight-errantry."
LINE 151: "Pardon me, your worship," said Sancho, "for, as I cannot read or
LINE 152: write, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of
LINE 153: the profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with
LINE 154: every kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for
LINE 155: myself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other
LINE 156: things more substantial."
LINE 157: "I do not say, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "that it is imperative on
LINE 158: knights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest
LINE 159: of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs
LINE 160: they found in the fields which they knew and I know too."
LINE 161: "A good thing it is," answered Sancho, "to know those herbs, for to my
LINE 162: thinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into
LINE 163: practice."
LINE 164: And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their
LINE 165: repast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the
LINE 166: night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare,
LINE 167: mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night
LINE 168: set in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed
LINE 169: them close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass
LINE 170: the night there, and it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to have
LINE 171: reached a house, as it was to his master's satisfaction to sleep under
LINE 172: the open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him he
LINE 173: performed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.
