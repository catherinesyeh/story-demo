LINE 3: "A good joke, that!" returned Don Quixote. "Books that have been
LINE 4: printed with the king's licence, and with the approbation of those to
LINE 5: whom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and
LINE 6: extolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant,
LINE 7: gentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank
LINE 8: or condition they may be—that these should be lies! And above all when
LINE 9: they carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the
LINE 10: father, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements,
LINE 11: step by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights!
LINE 12: Hush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to
LINE 13: act as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the
LINE 14: pleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there be
LINE 15: anything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed
LINE 16: before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and
LINE 17: serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts
LINE 18: swimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a
LINE 19: plaintive voice saying: 'Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this
LINE 20: dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath
LINE 21: these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself
LINE 22: into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be
LINE 23: worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the
LINE 24: seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;' and then the knight,
LINE 25: almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider,
LINE 26: without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing
LINE 27: himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive
LINE 28: armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the
LINE 29: midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows
LINE 30: what his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with
LINE 31: which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.

LINE 34: "The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a
LINE 35: strange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees
LINE 36: presents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure,
LINE 37: while the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless
LINE 38: birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing
LINE 39: branches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid
LINE 40: crystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted
LINE 41: gold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain
LINE 42: of many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic
LINE 43: fashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow
LINE 44: mansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with
LINE 45: fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of
LINE 46: varied aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.

LINE 49: "Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous
LINE 50: palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of
LINE 51: jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the
LINE 52: materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds,
LINE 53: carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is
LINE 54: still more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be more
LINE 55: charming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of
LINE 56: the castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself
LINE 57: now to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never
LINE 58: have done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them all
LINE 59: takes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand,
LINE 60: and without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or
LINE 61: castle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and bathes
LINE 62: him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with sweet-smelling
LINE 63: unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented
LINE 64: and perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his shoulders
LINE 65: a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and even
LINE 66: more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this,
LINE 67: they lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out in
LINE 68: such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they
LINE 69: pour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented
LINE 70: flowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels
LINE 71: wait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety
LINE 72: of dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which
LINE 73: to select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by
LINE 74: whom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is over
LINE 75: and the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking
LINE 76: his teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the
LINE 77: others, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his
LINE 78: side, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held
LINE 79: enchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish
LINE 80: the readers who are perusing his history.

LINE 83: "But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered
LINE 84: from it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one
LINE 85: reads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;
LINE 86: and take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and
LINE 87: you will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise
LINE 88: your spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since
LINE 89: I have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous,
LINE 90: well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have
LINE 91: learned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though
LINE 92: it be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like
LINE 93: a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune
LINE 94: thwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able
LINE 95: to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my
LINE 96: faith, señor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of
LINE 97: generosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree;
LINE 98: and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just
LINE 99: as faith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were
LINE 100: fortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor,
LINE 101: so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to
LINE 102: this poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world;
LINE 103: and I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so
LINE 104: long, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his
LINE 105: realm."
LINE 106: Sancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,
LINE 107: "Strive hard you, Señor Don Quixote, to give me that county so often
LINE 108: promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there
LINE 109: will be no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I
LINE 110: have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying
LINE 111: so much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government,
LINE 112: while the lord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they
LINE 113: pay him, without troubling himself about anything else. That's what
LINE 114: I'll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once
LINE 115: of the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things
LINE 116: go their own way."
LINE 117: "That, brother Sancho," said the canon, "only holds good as far as the
LINE 118: enjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must
LINE 119: attend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound
LINE 120: judgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the
LINE 121: truth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end
LINE 122: will always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of
LINE 123: the simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty."
LINE 124: "I don't understand those philosophies," returned Sancho Panza; "all I
LINE 125: know is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern
LINE 126: it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and
LINE 127: I shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I
LINE 128: should do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and
LINE 129: pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has
LINE 130: nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there
LINE 131: is an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let
LINE 132: us see one another, as one blind man said to the other."
LINE 133: "That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho," said the canon;
LINE 134: "but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of
LINE 135: counties."
LINE 136: To which Don Quixote returned, "I know not what more there is to be
LINE 137: said; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of
LINE 138: Gaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so,
LINE 139: without any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza,
LINE 140: for he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had."
LINE 141: The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be
LINE 142: capable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had
LINE 143: described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression
LINE 144: that the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and
LINE 145: lastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly
LINE 146: to obtain the county his master had promised him.
LINE 147: By this time the canon's servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the
LINE 148: sumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of
LINE 149: the meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of
LINE 150: some trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be
LINE 151: deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said. As
LINE 152: they were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a
LINE 153: bell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that
LINE 154: were close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat,
LINE 155: spotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket
LINE 156: with a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to
LINE 157: make it stop or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and
LINE 158: frightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and
LINE 159: then stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and
LINE 160: began to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and
LINE 161: understanding: "Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you
LINE 162: gone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my
LINE 163: daughter? Won't you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what
LINE 164: else can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A
LINE 165: plague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come
LINE 166: back, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any
LINE 167: rate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you
LINE 168: who ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become
LINE 169: of them?"
LINE 170: The goatherd's talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon,
LINE 171: who said to him, "As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in
LINE 172: such a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female,
LINE 173: as you say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you
LINE 174: can do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will
LINE 175: soothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest
LINE 176: herself," and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a
LINE 177: fork.
LINE 178: The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and
LINE 179: then said, "I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a
LINE 180: simpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but
LINE 181: the truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a
LINE 182: clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and
LINE 183: to beasts."
LINE 184: "That I can well believe," said the curate, "for I know already by
LINE 185: experience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds' huts
LINE 186: harbour philosophers."
LINE 187: "At all events, señor," returned the goatherd, "they shelter men of
LINE 188: experience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though
LINE 189: I may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it
LINE 190: will not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a
LINE 191: little, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman's word
LINE 192: (and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own."
LINE 193: To this Don Quixote replied, "Seeing that this affair has a certain
LINE 194: colour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most
LINE 195: gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence
LINE 196: they possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm,
LINE 197: and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So
LINE 198: begin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen."
LINE 199: "I draw my stakes," said Sancho, "and will retreat with this pasty to
LINE 200: the brook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I
LINE 201: have heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant's squire
LINE 202: should eat until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance,
LINE 203: because it often happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick
LINE 204: that they cannot find a way out of it for six days; and if the man is
LINE 205: not well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very
LINE 206: often he does, turned into a dried mummy."
LINE 207: "Thou art in the right of it, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "go where thou
LINE 208: wilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to
LINE 209: give my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good
LINE 210: fellow's story."
LINE 211: "It is what we shall all do," said the canon; and then begged the
LINE 212: goatherd to begin the promised tale.
LINE 213: The goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps
LINE 214: on the back, saying, "Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have time
LINE 215: enough to return to our fold." The goat seemed to understand him, for
LINE 216: as her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him
LINE 217: and looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he
LINE 218: was going to say, and then in these words he began his story.
