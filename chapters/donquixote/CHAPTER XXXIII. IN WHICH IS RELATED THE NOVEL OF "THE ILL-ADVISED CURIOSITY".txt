LINE 1: In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called
LINE 2: Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and
LINE 3: Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were
LINE 4: called by all that knew them "The Two Friends." They were unmarried,
LINE 5: young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to
LINE 6: account for the reciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is
LINE 7: true, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love than
LINE 8: Lothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; but
LINE 9: on occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those of
LINE 10: Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of
LINE 11: Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the
LINE 12: other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not
LINE 13: surpass it.
LINE 14: Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the
LINE 15: same city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable
LINE 16: herself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario,
LINE 17: without whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did
LINE 18: so, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the
LINE 19: negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short
LINE 20: time he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so
LINE 21: happy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks
LINE 22: unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune
LINE 23: had fallen to her. The first few days, those of a wedding being usually
LINE 24: days of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend Anselmo's house as
LINE 25: he had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the occasion, and
LINE 26: to gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days were
LINE 27: over and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he
LINE 28: began purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it
LINE 29: seemed to him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends'
LINE 30: houses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency
LINE 31: as in their masters' bachelor days: because, though true and genuine
LINE 32: friendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a
LINE 33: married man's honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable
LINE 34: to injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the
LINE 35: cessation of Lothario's visits, and complained of it to him, saying
LINE 36: that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his
LINE 37: society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by the
LINE 38: thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor
LINE 39: they had earned such a sweet name as that of "The Two Friends," he
LINE 40: should not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a
LINE 41: needless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such
LINE 42: a phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of his
LINE 43: house and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife
LINE 44: Camilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he would
LINE 45: wish her to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one another
LINE 46: she was grieved to see such coldness in him.
LINE 47: To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him
LINE 48: to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario
LINE 49: replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was
LINE 50: satisfied of his friend's good intentions, and it was agreed that on
LINE 51: two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine
LINE 52: with him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario
LINE 53: resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in
LINE 54: accordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to
LINE 55: him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom
LINE 56: heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what
LINE 57: friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife
LINE 58: associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the
LINE 59: market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations
LINE 60: (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be
LINE 61: easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom
LINE 62: most confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man
LINE 63: should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he
LINE 64: might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that
LINE 65: owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does
LINE 66: not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or
LINE 67: not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of
LINE 68: honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily
LINE 69: correct if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be found
LINE 70: as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true?
LINE 71: Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the
LINE 72: utmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and
LINE 73: strove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going
LINE 74: to his house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young
LINE 75: man, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of
LINE 76: possessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be
LINE 77: regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the
LINE 78: idle public. For though his integrity and reputation might bridle
LINE 79: slanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to hazard either his own
LINE 80: good name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of the days
LINE 81: agreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended was
LINE 82: unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with
LINE 83: complaints on one side and excuses on the other. It happened, however,
LINE 84: that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the
LINE 85: city, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario.
LINE 86: "Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give
LINE 87: sufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the
LINE 88: son of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard
LINE 89: hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune,
LINE 90: and above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and
LINE 91: Camilla for a wifeâ€”two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I
LINE 92: ought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good
LINE 93: things, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live
LINE 94: happily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole
LINE 95: world; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed and
LINE 96: oppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder at
LINE 97: myself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifle
LINE 98: it and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than if
LINE 99: I were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and
LINE 100: as, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping,
LINE 101: feeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friend
LINE 102: to afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distress
LINE 103: it causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the same
LINE 104: degree as my own folly has caused me misery."
LINE 105: The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he
LINE 106: was to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he
LINE 107: strove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend,
LINE 108: his conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety
LINE 109: which this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a
LINE 110: flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous
LINE 111: methods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew
LINE 112: he might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in
LINE 113: carrying them into effect.
LINE 114: "That is the truth," replied Anselmo, "and relying upon that I will
LINE 115: tell thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that
LINE 116: of knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think
LINE 117: her to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point
LINE 118: except by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity
LINE 119: of her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded,
LINE 120: my friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is
LINE 121: not tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the
LINE 122: promises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what
LINE 123: thanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be
LINE 124: bad, and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom
LINE 125: no opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband
LINE 126: that will take her life the first time he detects her in an
LINE 127: impropriety? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear
LINE 128: or want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of
LINE 129: temptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasons
LINE 130: and many others that I could give thee to justify and support the
LINE 131: opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this
LINE 132: crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed
LINE 133: and by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out,
LINE 134: as I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my
LINE 135: good fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my
LINE 136: desire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says 'Who
LINE 137: shall find her?' has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the
LINE 138: contrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have
LINE 139: been right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which
LINE 140: my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing
LINE 141: of all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me
LINE 142: from carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that
LINE 143: thou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this
LINE 144: purpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities to
LINE 145: that end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for
LINE 146: the pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.
LINE 147: And among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to
LINE 148: thee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the
LINE 149: conquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account
LINE 150: that accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone;
LINE 151: thus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my
LINE 152: wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know
LINE 153: well will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,
LINE 154: therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou
LINE 155: wilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor
LINE 156: slothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and
LINE 157: with the loyalty our friendship assures me of."
LINE 158: Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them
LINE 159: with such attention that, except to say what has been already
LINE 160: mentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished. Then
LINE 161: perceiving that he had no more to say, after regarding him for a while,
LINE 162: as one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and
LINE 163: amazement, he said to him, "I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my
LINE 164: friend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thought
LINE 165: that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go
LINE 166: so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to
LINE 167: thee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not
LINE 168: know thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that
LINE 169: I am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the
LINE 170: Anselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I
LINE 171: should be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of
LINE 172: that Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou demandest of me
LINE 173: what should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest. True friends will
LINE 174: prove their friends and make use of them, as a poet has said, _usque ad
LINE 175: aras;_ whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship
LINE 176: in things that are contrary to God's will. If this, then, was a
LINE 177: heathen's feeling about friendship, how much more should it be a
LINE 178: Christian's, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the
LINE 179: sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to
LINE 180: put aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it
LINE 181: should not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in
LINE 182: such as affect the friend's life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in
LINE 183: which of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to
LINE 184: gratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?
LINE 185: Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as I
LINE 186: understand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to
LINE 187: rob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it
LINE 188: is plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than
LINE 189: dead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much
LINE 190: wrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and
LINE 191: consequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not
LINE 192: impatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the
LINE 193: object of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to
LINE 194: reply and for me to hear."
LINE 195: "Be it so," said Anselmo, "say what thou wilt."
LINE 196: Lothario then went on to say, "It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is
LINE 197: just now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can
LINE 198: never be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the
LINE 199: Holy Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the
LINE 200: understanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have
LINE 201: examples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not
LINE 202: admitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be
LINE 203: denied, like, '_If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are
LINE 204: equal:_' and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they
LINE 205: do not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their
LINE 206: eyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the
LINE 207: truth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have
LINE 208: to adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so
LINE 209: absurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that
LINE 210: I feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy
LINE 211: simplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am
LINE 212: even tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy
LINE 213: pernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow
LINE 214: me to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from
LINE 215: dealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say,
LINE 216: Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest
LINE 217: woman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is
LINE 218: pure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me
LINE 219: so. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous,
LINE 220: pure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou
LINE 221: believest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacksâ€”as
LINE 222: doubtless she wouldâ€”what higher titles than those she possesses now
LINE 223: dost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then, or in what will she be
LINE 224: better then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her to be what
LINE 225: thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou dost
LINE 226: not hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to prove her
LINE 227: instead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to
LINE 228: thee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an
LINE 229: uncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after
LINE 230: trial, it will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it
LINE 231: is conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than
LINE 232: advantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds,
LINE 233: more especially when they are things which we are not forced or
LINE 234: compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly
LINE 235: madness to attempt them.
LINE 236: "Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake
LINE 237: of the world, or for both; those undertaken for God's sake are those
LINE 238: which the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of
LINE 239: angels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are
LINE 240: those of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a
LINE 241: variety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are
LINE 242: called the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of
LINE 243: God and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner
LINE 244: do they see in the enemy's wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could
LINE 245: make, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the
LINE 246: manifest peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire of
LINE 247: defending their faith, their country, and their king, they fling
LINE 248: themselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths
LINE 249: that await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and
LINE 250: there is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of
LINE 251: difficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy
LINE 252: wish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor
LINE 253: the blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue be
LINE 254: as thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more
LINE 255: honoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be
LINE 256: reduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail
LINE 257: thee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has
LINE 258: befallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou
LINE 259: knowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let
LINE 260: me repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at
LINE 261: the end of the first part of his 'Tears of Saint Peter,' which says
LINE 262: thus:
LINE 263: The anguish and the shame but greater grew
LINE 264: In Peter's heart as morning slowly came;
LINE 265: No eye was there to see him, well he knew,
LINE 266: Yet he himself was to himself a shame;
LINE 267: Exposed to all men's gaze, or screened from view,
LINE 268: A noble heart will feel the pang the same;
LINE 269: A prey to shame the sinning soul will be,
LINE 270: Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see.
LINE 271: Thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather
LINE 272: thou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of
LINE 273: blood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet
LINE 274: tells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,
LINE 275: better advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction
LINE 276: it contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.
LINE 277: Moreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the
LINE 278: great error thou wouldst commit.
LINE 279: "Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and
LINE 280: lawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence
LINE 281: and purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been
LINE 282: satisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity,
LINE 283: quality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could
LINE 284: possibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing
LINE 285: nothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to
LINE 286: take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by
LINE 287: mere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as
LINE 288: fine as they said? And if thou didst, and if the stone should resist so
LINE 289: silly a test, that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and if
LINE 290: it were broken, as it might be, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly it
LINE 291: would, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in the opinion of all.
LINE 292: Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the
LINE 293: finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and that
LINE 294: it is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; for
LINE 295: if she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she now
LINE 296: possesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist, bethink thee
LINE 297: now how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good reason thou
LINE 298: wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and
LINE 299: thine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as a
LINE 300: chaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists
LINE 301: in reputation; and since thy wife's is of that high excellence that
LINE 302: thou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in
LINE 303: question? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and
LINE 304: that impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and
LINE 305: fall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all
LINE 306: obstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to
LINE 307: attain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.
LINE 308: Naturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur
LINE 309: of purest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they make
LINE 310: use of this artifice. Having ascertained the places which it frequents
LINE 311: and passes, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it,
LINE 312: drive it towards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud
LINE 313: it halts, and allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass
LINE 314: through the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values
LINE 315: more than life and liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine,
LINE 316: and whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who
LINE 317: wishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a
LINE 318: course different from that employed with the ermine; he must not put
LINE 319: before her the mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers,
LINE 320: because perhapsâ€”and even without a perhapsâ€”she may not have sufficient
LINE 321: virtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread under
LINE 322: foot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of
LINE 323: virtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A virtuous
LINE 324: woman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to be
LINE 325: tarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She must be
LINE 326: treated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protected and
LINE 327: prized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and
LINE 328: flowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a
LINE 329: blossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating
LINE 330: they may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to
LINE 331: thee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy,
LINE 332: and it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A
LINE 333: prudent old man was giving advice to another, the father of a young
LINE 334: girl, to lock her up, watch over her and keep her in seclusion, and
LINE 335: among other arguments he used these:
LINE 336: Woman is a thing of glass;
LINE 337: But her brittleness 'tis best
LINE 338: Not too curiously to test:
LINE 339: Who knows what may come to pass?
LINE 340: Breaking is an easy matter,
LINE 341: And it's folly to expose
LINE 342: What you cannot mend to blows;
LINE 343: What you can't make whole to shatter.
LINE 344: This, then, all may hold as true,
LINE 345: And the reason's plain to see;
LINE 346: For if DanaÃ«s there be,
LINE 347: There are golden showers too.
LINE 348: "All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to
LINE 349: what concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what
LINE 350: regards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into
LINE 351: which thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate
LINE 352: thee makes it necessary.
LINE 353: "Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a
LINE 354: thing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim
LINE 355: at this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou
LINE 356: wouldst rob me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court
LINE 357: to her as thou requirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without
LINE 358: honour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed
LINE 359: to what I owe to my own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst
LINE 360: have me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I
LINE 361: press my suit upon her, will suppose that I have perceived in her
LINE 362: something light that has encouraged me to make known to her my base
LINE 363: desire; and if she holds herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches
LINE 364: thee as belonging to her; and hence arises what so commonly takes
LINE 365: place, that the husband of the adulterous woman, though he may not be
LINE 366: aware of or have given any cause for his wife's failure in her duty, or
LINE 367: (being careless or negligent) have had it in his power to prevent his
LINE 368: dishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name,
LINE 369: and in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all
LINE 370: who know of his wife's guilt, though they see that he is unfortunate
LINE 371: not by his own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I will
LINE 372: tell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the
LINE 373: unchaste wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, nor
LINE 374: have done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be not
LINE 375: weary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good.
LINE 376: "When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy
LINE 377: Scripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took
LINE 378: a rib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when
LINE 379: Adam awoke and beheld her he said, 'This is flesh of my flesh, and bone
LINE 380: of my bone.' And God said 'For this shall a man leave his father and
LINE 381: his mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted
LINE 382: the divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can
LINE 383: loose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous
LINE 384: sacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh;
LINE 385: and even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they
LINE 386: have two souls they have but one will. And hence it follows that as the
LINE 387: flesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband the
LINE 388: stains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the
LINE 389: husband's flesh, though he, as has been said, may have given no cause
LINE 390: for them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is felt
LINE 391: by the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels the hurt
LINE 392: to the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being one with
LINE 393: her, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour or
LINE 394: dishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife's is of that
LINE 395: kind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held
LINE 396: dishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art
LINE 397: encountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;
LINE 398: see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up
LINE 399: passions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;
LINE 400: reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou
LINE 401: wilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to
LINE 402: express it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy
LINE 403: vile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour
LINE 404: and misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy
LINE 405: friendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive."
LINE 406: Having said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and
LINE 407: Anselmo, troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while
LINE 408: to utter a word in reply; but at length he said, "I have listened,
LINE 409: Lothario my friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast
LINE 410: chosen to say to me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I
LINE 411: have seen that high intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection
LINE 412: of true friendship thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confess
LINE 413: that if I am not guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying
LINE 414: from the good and pursuing the evil. This being so, thou must remember
LINE 415: that I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes
LINE 416: suffer from, when the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster,
LINE 417: charcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, much more to
LINE 418: eat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to
LINE 419: cure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a
LINE 420: beginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to
LINE 421: pay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her virtue will
LINE 422: give way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest
LINE 423: satisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to
LINE 424: do, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard my
LINE 425: honour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that,
LINE 426: being, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to
LINE 427: permit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour
LINE 428: thou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as
LINE 429: high as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying
LINE 430: court to her, that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on
LINE 431: finding in her that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the
LINE 432: plain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her
LINE 433: esteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst
LINE 434: afford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if
LINE 435: further difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said,
LINE 436: if thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue
LINE 437: decided."
LINE 438: Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing
LINE 439: what further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to
LINE 440: dissuade him from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his
LINE 441: pernicious scheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to
LINE 442: gratify him and do what he asked, intending to manage the business so
LINE 443: as to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in
LINE 444: reply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, for he
LINE 445: would undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he
LINE 446: pleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked
LINE 447: him for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; and
LINE 448: it was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo
LINE 449: affording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone with
LINE 450: Camilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels to offer and present
LINE 451: to her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her to music, and write
LINE 452: verses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take the trouble of
LINE 453: composing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario agreed to all
LINE 454: with an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed, and with
LINE 455: this understanding they returned to Anselmo's house, where they found
LINE 456: Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was later
LINE 457: than usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own house,
LINE 458: and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was troubled
LINE 459: in mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advised
LINE 460: business. That night, however, he thought of a plan by which he might
LINE 461: deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The next day he went to
LINE 462: dine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received and
LINE 463: treated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection her husband
LINE 464: felt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told
LINE 465: Lothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to some pressing
LINE 466: business, as he would return in an hour and a half. Camilla begged him
LINE 467: not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could
LINE 468: persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain
LINE 469: waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with
LINE 470: him. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until
LINE 471: he came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the
LINE 472: reason, or the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected
LINE 473: it was a pretence.
LINE 474: Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at
LINE 475: the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario
LINE 476: saw himself in the lists according to his friend's wish, and facing an
LINE 477: enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed
LINE 478: knights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was
LINE 479: to lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand,
LINE 480: and, asking Camilla's pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to
LINE 481: take a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he
LINE 482: could repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair,
LINE 483: and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and
LINE 484: there he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding
LINE 485: Camilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had
LINE 486: stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for
LINE 487: conversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario
LINE 488: should wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as to
LINE 489: his success. Everything fell out as he wished; Lothario awoke, and the
LINE 490: two at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what he was anxious to
LINE 491: know, and Lothario in answer told him that he had not thought it
LINE 492: advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and therefore had
LINE 493: only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all the city
LINE 494: spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to him an
LINE 495: excellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render her
LINE 496: disposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availing
LINE 497: himself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive
LINE 498: one who is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms
LINE 499: himself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming,
LINE 500: discloses himself at length, and effects his purpose if at the
LINE 501: beginning his wiles are not discovered. All this gave great
LINE 502: satisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would afford the same
LINE 503: opportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he would find
LINE 504: things to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot.
LINE 505: Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word
LINE 506: to Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he
LINE 507: had never been able to draw from her the slightest indication of
LINE 508: consent to anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope;
LINE 509: on the contrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.
LINE 510: "So far well," said Anselmo; "Camilla has thus far resisted words; we
LINE 511: must now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two
LINE 512: thousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many
LINE 513: more to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly
LINE 514: attired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are
LINE 515: beautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists this
LINE 516: temptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble."
LINE 517: Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the
LINE 518: undertaking to the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it
LINE 519: wearied and vanquished. The next day he received the four thousand
LINE 520: crowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what
LINE 521: to say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind to
LINE 522: tell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as
LINE 523: against words, and that there was no use in taking any further trouble,
LINE 524: for the time was all spent to no purpose.
LINE 525: But chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that
LINE 526: Anselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,
LINE 527: shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen
LINE 528: through the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for
LINE 529: more than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor
LINE 530: would utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he came
LINE 531: to the conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies
LINE 532: of Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were
LINE 533: so, he came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had
LINE 534: and in what humour Camilla was. Lothario replied that he was not
LINE 535: disposed to go on with the business, for she had answered him so
LINE 536: angrily and harshly that he had no heart to say anything more to her.
LINE 537: "Ah, Lothario, Lothario," said Anselmo, "how ill dost thou meet thy
LINE 538: obligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have
LINE 539: been just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou
LINE 540: hast not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former
LINE 541: occasions thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no
LINE 542: doubt it is, why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by
LINE 543: craft to deprive me of the means I might find of attaining my desire?"
LINE 544: Anselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with
LINE 545: shame and confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by
LINE 546: having been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from that
LINE 547: moment devote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as he
LINE 548: would see if he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take the
LINE 549: trouble, for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all
LINE 550: suspicions from his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an
LINE 551: opportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he resolved to
LINE 552: absent himself from his house for eight days, betaking himself to that
LINE 553: of a friend of his who lived in a village not far from the city; and,
LINE 554: the better to account for his departure to Camilla, he so arranged it
LINE 555: that the friend should send him a very pressing invitation.
LINE 556: Unhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thou
LINE 557: plotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working against
LINE 558: thyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thy
LINE 559: wife Camilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness,
LINE 560: no one assails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the walls
LINE 561: of thy house, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes,
LINE 562: the fulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her
LINE 563: will, making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven's. If, then,
LINE 564: the mine of her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without
LINE 565: labour all the wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt
LINE 566: thou dig the earth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure,
LINE 567: risking the collapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of
LINE 568: her weak nature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilities
LINE 569: that which is possible may with justice be withheld, as was better
LINE 570: expressed by a poet who said:
LINE 571: 'Tis mine to seek for life in death,
LINE 572: Health in disease seek I,
LINE 573: I seek in prison freedom's breath,
LINE 574: In traitors loyalty.
LINE 575: So Fate that ever scorns to grant
LINE 576: Or grace or boon to me,
LINE 577: Since what can never be I want,
LINE 578: Denies me what might be.
LINE 579: The next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leaving
LINE 580: instructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come
LINE 581: to look after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to treat
LINE 582: him as she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and
LINE 583: right-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, and
LINE 584: bade him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy
LINE 585: his seat at the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from not
LINE 586: feeling confidence that she would be able to manage his house, let him
LINE 587: try her this time, and he would find by experience that she was equal
LINE 588: to greater responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasure
LINE 589: to have it so, and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla said
LINE 590: she would do so, though against her will.
LINE 591: Anselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he was
LINE 592: received by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she never
LINE 593: suffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her
LINE 594: men and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by
LINE 595: name, to whom she was much attached (for they had been brought up
LINE 596: together from childhood in her father's house), and whom she had kept
LINE 597: with her after her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario
LINE 598: did not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removed
LINE 599: the cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were
LINE 600: Camilla's orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than
LINE 601: Camilla and never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts
LINE 602: fixed upon other things more to her taste, and wanting that time and
LINE 603: opportunity for her own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress's
LINE 604: commands, but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered
LINE 605: her to do so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her
LINE 606: countenance, the composure of her aspect were enough to bridle the
LINE 607: tongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many virtues of Camilla
LINE 608: exerted in imposing silence on Lothario's tongue proved mischievous for
LINE 609: both of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts were busy, and
LINE 610: could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla's goodness and
LINE 611: beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, not
LINE 612: to say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might have
LINE 613: been speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was;
LINE 614: and thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance to
LINE 615: Anselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city
LINE 616: and going where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But
LINE 617: already the delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held him
LINE 618: fast. He put a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and
LINE 619: repress the pleasure he found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he
LINE 620: blamed himself for his weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad
LINE 621: Christian; then he argued the matter and compared himself with Anselmo;
LINE 622: always coming to the conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo
LINE 623: had been worse than his faithlessness, and that if he could excuse his
LINE 624: intentions as easily before God as with man, he had no reason to fear
LINE 625: any punishment for his offence.
LINE 626: In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the
LINE 627: opportunity which the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew
LINE 628: the loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object
LINE 629: towards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three
LINE 630: days absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual struggle
LINE 631: with his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so much
LINE 632: vehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed with
LINE 633: amazement, and could only rise from her place and retire to her room
LINE 634: without answering him a word. But the hope which always springs up with
LINE 635: love was not weakened in Lothario by this repelling demeanour; on the
LINE 636: contrary his passion for Camilla increased, and she discovering in him
LINE 637: what she had never expected, knew not what to do; and considering it
LINE 638: neither safe nor right to give him the chance or opportunity of
LINE 639: speaking to her again, she resolved to send, as she did that very
LINE 640: night, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, in which she
LINE 641: addressed the following words to him.
