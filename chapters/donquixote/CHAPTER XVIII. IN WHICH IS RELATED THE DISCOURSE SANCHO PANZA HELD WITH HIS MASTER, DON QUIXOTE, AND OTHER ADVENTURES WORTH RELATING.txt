LINE 3: Sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on
LINE 4: his beast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, "I have
LINE 5: now come to the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is
LINE 6: beyond a doubt enchanted, because those who have so atrociously
LINE 7: diverted themselves with thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings
LINE 8: of another world? and I hold this confirmed by having noticed that when
LINE 9: I was by the wall of the yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy,
LINE 10: it was out of my power to mount upon it, nor could I even dismount from
LINE 11: Rocinante, because they no doubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee
LINE 12: by the faith of what I am that if I had been able to climb up or
LINE 13: dismount, I would have avenged thee in such a way that those braggart
LINE 14: thieves would have remembered their freak for ever, even though in so
LINE 15: doing I knew that I contravened the laws of chivalry, which, as I have
LINE 16: often told thee, do not permit a knight to lay hands on him who is not
LINE 17: one, save in case of urgent and great necessity in defence of his own
LINE 18: life and person."
LINE 19: "I would have avenged myself too if I could," said Sancho, "whether I
LINE 20: had been dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am
LINE 21: persuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or
LINE 22: enchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like
LINE 23: ourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them
LINE 24: when they were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and
LINE 25: another Tenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan
LINE 26: Palomeque the Left-handed; so that, señor, your not being able to leap
LINE 27: over the wall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something
LINE 28: else besides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this
LINE 29: is, that these adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into
LINE 30: such misadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and
LINE 31: that the best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be
LINE 32: for us to return home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our
LINE 33: business, and give over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to
LINE 34: bucket, as the saying is."
LINE 35: "How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho," replied Don Quixote;
LINE 36: "hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt
LINE 37: see with thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the
LINE 38: pursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there
LINE 39: be in the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle,
LINE 40: and triumphing over one's enemy? None, beyond all doubt."
LINE 41: "Very likely," answered Sancho, "though I do not know it; all I know is
LINE 42: that since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been
LINE 43: one (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a
LINE 44: number) we have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan,
LINE 45: and even out of that your worship came with half an ear and half a
LINE 46: helmet the less; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and
LINE 47: more cudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over
LINE 48: and above, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot
LINE 49: avenge myself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it,
LINE 50: of conquering an enemy is like."
LINE 51: "That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho," replied
LINE 52: Don Quixote; "but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some
LINE 53: sword made by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect
LINE 54: upon him who carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may
LINE 55: procure for me that which belonged to Amadis when he was called 'The
LINE 56: Knight of the Burning Sword,' which was one of the best swords that
LINE 57: ever knight in the world possessed, for, besides having the said
LINE 58: virtue, it cut like a razor, and there was no armour, however strong
LINE 59: and enchanted it might be, that could resist it."
LINE 60: "Such is my luck," said Sancho, "that even if that happened and your
LINE 61: worship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out
LINE 62: serviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,
LINE 63: they might sup sorrow."
LINE 64: "Fear not that, Sancho," said Don Quixote: "Heaven will deal better by
LINE 65: thee."
LINE 66: Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the
LINE 67: road they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a
LINE 68: large and thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and
LINE 69: said:
LINE 70: "This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is
LINE 71: reserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any
LINE 72: other shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do
LINE 73: deeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to
LINE 74: come. Seest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all
LINE 75: that is churned up by a vast army composed of various and countless
LINE 76: nations that comes marching there."
LINE 77: "According to that there must be two," said Sancho, "for on this
LINE 78: opposite side also there rises just such another cloud of dust."
LINE 79: Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing
LINE 80: exceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and
LINE 81: encounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and
LINE 82: seasons his fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures,
LINE 83: crazy feats, loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of
LINE 84: chivalry, and everything he said, thought, or did had reference to such
LINE 85: things. Now the cloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great
LINE 86: droves of sheep coming along the same road in opposite directions,
LINE 87: which, because of the dust, did not become visible until they drew
LINE 88: near, but Don Quixote asserted so positively that they were armies that
LINE 89: Sancho was led to believe it and say, "Well, and what are we to do,
LINE 90: señor?"

LINE 93: "What?" said Don Quixote: "give aid and assistance to the weak and
LINE 94: those who need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes
LINE 95: opposite to us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron,
LINE 96: lord of the great isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me
LINE 97: is that of his enemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare
LINE 98: Arm, for he always goes into battle with his right arm bare."
LINE 99: "But why are these two lords such enemies?"
LINE 100: "They are at enmity," replied Don Quixote, "because this Alifanfaron is
LINE 101: a furious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is
LINE 102: a very beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her
LINE 103: father is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first
LINE 104: abandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his
LINE 105: own."
LINE 106: "By my beard," said Sancho, "but Pentapolin does quite right, and I
LINE 107: will help him as much as I can."
LINE 108: "In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "for
LINE 109: to engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed
LINE 110: knight."
LINE 111: "That I can well understand," answered Sancho; "but where shall we put
LINE 112: this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for I
LINE 113: believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast
LINE 114: of this kind."
LINE 115: "That is true," said Don Quixote, "and what you had best do with him is
LINE 116: to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the
LINE 117: horses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even
LINE 118: Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to
LINE 119: me and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief
LINE 120: knights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better
LINE 121: see and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder,
LINE 122: whence both armies may be seen."
LINE 123: They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the
LINE 124: two droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen
LINE 125: if the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the
LINE 126: sight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and
LINE 127: what did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice:
LINE 128: "That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon
LINE 129: his shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the
LINE 130: valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with
LINE 131: flowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an
LINE 132: azure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that
LINE 133: other of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless
LINE 134: Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour
LINE 135: wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to
LINE 136: tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to the
LINE 137: ground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn
LINE 138: thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the
LINE 139: van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel
LINE 140: of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms
LINE 141: quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat
LINE 142: or on a field tawny with a motto which says _Miau_, which is the
LINE 143: beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the
LINE 144: peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the
LINE 145: other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and
LINE 146: bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is
LINE 147: a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of
LINE 148: the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes
LINE 149: the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears
LINE 150: azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque,
LINE 151: who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in
LINE 152: Castilian that says, _'Rastrea mi suerte'_." And so he went on naming a
LINE 153: number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination,
LINE 154: and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and
LINE 155: mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and
LINE 156: without a pause, he continued, "People of divers nations compose this
LINE 157: squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the
LINE 158: famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that
LINE 159: sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed
LINE 160: cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various
LINE 161: ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians,
LINE 162: faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the
LINE 163: Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever
LINE 164: shift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the
LINE 165: Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose
LINE 166: features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In
LINE 167: this other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams
LINE 168: of the olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances
LINE 169: with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in
LINE 170: the fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian
LINE 171: plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the
LINE 172: Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears
LINE 173: of corn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that
LINE 174: bathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed
LINE 175: their herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed
LINE 176: for its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad
LINE 177: Pyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as
LINE 178: many as all Europe includes and contains."
LINE 179: Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to
LINE 180: each its proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and
LINE 181: saturated with what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung
LINE 182: upon his words without speaking, and from time to time turned to try if
LINE 183: he could see the knights and giants his master was describing, and as
LINE 184: he could not make out one of them he said to him:
LINE 185: "Señor, devil take it if there's a sign of any man you talk of, knight
LINE 186: or giant, in the whole thing; maybe it's all enchantment, like the
LINE 187: phantoms last night."
LINE 188: "How canst thou say that!" answered Don Quixote; "dost thou not hear
LINE 189: the neighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of
LINE 190: the drums?"
LINE 191: "I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep," said Sancho;
LINE 192: which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.
LINE 193: "The fear thou art in, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "prevents thee from
LINE 194: seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to
LINE 195: derange the senses and make things appear different from what they are;
LINE 196: if thou art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself,
LINE 197: for alone I suffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give
LINE 198: my aid;" and so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the
LINE 199: lance in rest, shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted
LINE 200: after him, crying, "Come back, Señor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are
LINE 201: sheep and ewes you are charging! Come back! Unlucky the father that
LINE 202: begot me! what madness is this! Look, there is no giant, nor knight,
LINE 203: nor cats, nor arms, nor shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or
LINE 204: bedevilled. What are you about? Sinner that I am before God!" But not
LINE 205: for all these entreaties did Don Quixote turn back; on the contrary he
LINE 206: went on shouting out, "Ho, knights, ye who follow and fight under the
LINE 207: banners of the valiant emperor Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me
LINE 208: all; ye shall see how easily I shall give him his revenge over his
LINE 209: enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana."
LINE 210: So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began
LINE 211: spearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were
LINE 212: transfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers
LINE 213: accompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,
LINE 214: they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as
LINE 215: big as one's fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting
LINE 216: drive right and left kept saying:
LINE 217: "Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single
LINE 218: knight who would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee
LINE 219: yield thy life a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant
LINE 220: Pentapolin Garamanta." Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that
LINE 221: struck him on the side and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling
LINE 222: himself so smitten, he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for
LINE 223: certain, and recollecting his liquor he drew out his flask, and putting
LINE 224: it to his mouth began to pour the contents into his stomach; but ere he
LINE 225: had succeeded in swallowing what seemed to him enough, there came
LINE 226: another almond which struck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly
LINE 227: that it smashed it to pieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders
LINE 228: out of his mouth in its course, and sorely crushing two fingers of his
LINE 229: hand. Such was the force of the first blow and of the second, that the
LINE 230: poor knight in spite of himself came down backwards off his horse. The
LINE 231: shepherds came up, and felt sure they had killed him; so in all haste
LINE 232: they collected their flock together, took up the dead beasts, of which
LINE 233: there were more than seven, and made off without waiting to ascertain
LINE 234: anything further.
LINE 235: All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his
LINE 236: master was performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and
LINE 237: the occasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him,
LINE 238: then, brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken
LINE 239: themselves off, he ran to him and found him in very bad case, though
LINE 240: not unconscious; and said he:
LINE 241: "Did I not tell you to come back, Señor Don Quixote; and that what you
LINE 242: were going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?"
LINE 243: "That's how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify
LINE 244: things," answered Don Quixote; "thou must know, Sancho, that it is a
LINE 245: very easy matter for those of his sort to make us believe what they
LINE 246: choose; and this malignant being who persecutes me, envious of the
LINE 247: glory he knew I was to win in this battle, has turned the squadrons of
LINE 248: the enemy into droves of sheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of
LINE 249: thee, Sancho, to undeceive thyself, and see that what I say is true;
LINE 250: mount thy ass and follow them quietly, and thou shalt see that when
LINE 251: they have gone some little distance from this they will return to their
LINE 252: original shape and, ceasing to be sheep, become men in all respects as
LINE 253: I described them to thee at first. But go not just yet, for I want thy
LINE 254: help and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth and
LINE 255: grinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in my
LINE 256: mouth."
LINE 257: Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now
LINE 258: just at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote,
LINE 259: so, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he
LINE 260: discharged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full
LINE 261: into the beard of the compassionate squire.
LINE 262: "Holy Mary!" cried Sancho, "what is this that has happened me? Clearly
LINE 263: this sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;"
LINE 264: but considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the
LINE 265: colour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the
LINE 266: flask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a
LINE 267: loathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his
LINE 268: very master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his
LINE 269: ass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his
LINE 270: master, out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took
LINE 271: leave of his senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved
LINE 272: to quit his master and return home, even though he forfeited the wages
LINE 273: of his service and all hopes of the promised island.
LINE 274: Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep
LINE 275: his teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of
LINE 276: the bridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master's
LINE 277: side—so loyal and well-behaved was he—and betook himself to where the
LINE 278: squire stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one
LINE 279: in deep dejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote
LINE 280: said to him:
LINE 281: "Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he
LINE 282: does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs
LINE 283: that fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with
LINE 284: us, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence
LINE 285: it follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh
LINE 286: at hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which
LINE 287: happen to me, since thou hast no share in them."
LINE 288: "How have I not?" replied Sancho; "was he whom they blanketed yesterday
LINE 289: perchance any other than my father's son? and the alforjas that are
LINE 290: missing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but
LINE 291: myself?"
LINE 292: "What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 293: "Yes, they are missing," answered Sancho.
LINE 294: "In that case we have nothing to eat to-day," replied Don Quixote.
LINE 295: "It would be so," answered Sancho, "if there were none of the herbs
LINE 296: your worship says you know in these meadows, those with which
LINE 297: knights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like
LINE 298: shortcomings."
LINE 299: "For all that," answered Don Quixote, "I would rather have just now a
LINE 300: quarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards' heads, than all
LINE 301: the herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna's notes.
LINE 302: Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,
LINE 303: for God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially
LINE 304: when we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the
LINE 305: midges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the
LINE 306: water, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good
LINE 307: and on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just."
LINE 308: "Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant," said
LINE 309: Sancho.
LINE 310: "Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho," said Don
LINE 311: Quixote; "for there were knights-errant in former times as well
LINE 312: qualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an
LINE 313: encampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris;
LINE 314: whereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor the
LINE 315: pen the lance."
LINE 316: "Well, be it as your worship says," replied Sancho; "let us be off now
LINE 317: and find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be
LINE 318: somewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms,
LINE 319: nor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole
LINE 320: concern."
LINE 321: "Ask that of God, my son," said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on where
LINE 322: thou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach
LINE 323: me here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my
LINE 324: teeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw,
LINE 325: for it is there I feel the pain."
LINE 326: Sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, "How many
LINE 327: grinders used your worship have on this side?"
LINE 328: "Four," replied Don Quixote, "besides the back-tooth, all whole and
LINE 329: quite sound."
LINE 330: "Mind what you are saying, señor."
LINE 331: "I say four, if not five," answered Don Quixote, "for never in my life
LINE 332: have I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been
LINE 333: destroyed by any decay or rheum."
LINE 334: "Well, then," said Sancho, "in this lower side your worship has no more
LINE 335: than two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any
LINE 336: at all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand."
LINE 337: "Luckless that I am!" said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire
LINE 338: gave him; "I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the
LINE 339: sword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a
LINE 340: mill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a
LINE 341: diamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to
LINE 342: all this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at
LINE 343: whatever pace thou wilt."
LINE 344: Sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he
LINE 345: thought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was
LINE 346: there very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow
LINE 347: pace—for the pain in Don Quixote's jaws kept him uneasy and
LINE 348: ill-disposed for speed—Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him
LINE 349: by talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was that
LINE 350: which will be told in the following chapter.
