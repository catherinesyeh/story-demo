LINE 3: "It is as you say, señor canon," said the curate; "and for that reason
LINE 4: those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more
LINE 5: censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the
LINE 6: rules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous
LINE 7: in prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse."
LINE 8: "I myself, at any rate," said the canon, "was once tempted to write a
LINE 9: book of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be
LINE 10: observed; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets
LINE 11: written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed
LINE 12: them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and
LINE 13: intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but
LINE 14: the pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained
LINE 15: flattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as
LINE 16: well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my
LINE 17: profession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous
LINE 18: than the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise few
LINE 19: than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to
LINE 20: the stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such
LINE 21: books falls for the most part.
LINE 22: "But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of
LINE 23: finishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that
LINE 24: are acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in
LINE 25: vogue, as well those that are pure invention as those founded on
LINE 26: history, are, all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that
LINE 27: have neither head nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with
LINE 28: delight, and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so
LINE 29: far from it; and if the authors who write them, and the players who act
LINE 30: them, say that this is what they must be, for the public wants this and
LINE 31: will have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out a
LINE 32: plot according to the laws of art will only find some half-dozen
LINE 33: intelligent people to understand them, while all the rest remain blind
LINE 34: to the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is better
LINE 35: to get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book will
LINE 36: fare the same way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to
LINE 37: observe the principles I have spoken of, and I shall be 'the tailor of
LINE 38: the corner.' And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors
LINE 39: that they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they
LINE 40: would attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays in
LINE 41: accordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so
LINE 42: thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can
LINE 43: wean them from it.
LINE 44: "I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, 'Tell me,
LINE 45: do you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies
LINE 46: acted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were
LINE 47: such that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and
LINE 48: interest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the
LINE 49: higher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these three
LINE 50: alone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?'
LINE 51: "'No doubt,' replied the actor in question, 'you mean the "Isabella,"
LINE 52: the "Phyllis," and the "Alexandra."'
LINE 53: "'Those are the ones I mean,' said I; 'and see if they did not observe
LINE 54: the principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show
LINE 55: their superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not
LINE 56: lie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who
LINE 57: don't know how to produce something else. "The Ingratitude Revenged"
LINE 58: was not nonsense, nor was there any in "The Numantia," nor any to be
LINE 59: found in "The Merchant Lover," nor yet in "The Friendly Fair Foe," nor
LINE 60: in some others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their
LINE 61: own fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;'
LINE 62: some further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him
LINE 63: rather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could
LINE 64: disabuse him of his error."
LINE 65: "You have touched upon a subject, señor canon," observed the curate
LINE 66: here, "that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in
LINE 67: vogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the
LINE 68: books of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be
LINE 69: the mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of the
LINE 70: truth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense,
LINE 71: models of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can
LINE 72: there be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an
LINE 73: infant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first
LINE 74: act, and in the second a grown-up bearded man? Or what greater
LINE 75: absurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a
LINE 76: swashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language,
LINE 77: a page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a princess who is
LINE 78: a kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention to the
LINE 79: time in which the action they represent may or can take place, save
LINE 80: that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the second
LINE 81: in Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in
LINE 82: four acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would have
LINE 83: been laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is
LINE 84: the main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for
LINE 85: any average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed
LINE 86: to pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal
LINE 87: personage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered
LINE 88: Jerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of
LINE 89: Bouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?
LINE 90: or, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are
LINE 91: introduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at
LINE 92: different times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance
LINE 93: of probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view
LINE 94: are inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who
LINE 95: say that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected
LINE 96: refinement. And then if we turn to sacred dramas—what miracles they
LINE 97: invent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to
LINE 98: one saint the miracles of another! And even in secular plays they
LINE 99: venture to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that
LINE 100: they think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will
LINE 101: come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. All
LINE 102: this tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history,
LINE 103: nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners who
LINE 104: scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous
LINE 105: and ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we
LINE 106: produce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief
LINE 107: object well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to
LINE 108: be performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless
LINE 109: amusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which
LINE 110: idleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any
LINE 111: sort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind
LINE 112: those who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made,
LINE 113: since, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort. To
LINE 114: this I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison,
LINE 115: better attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so;
LINE 116: for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, the
LINE 117: hearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious
LINE 118: parts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the
LINE 119: arguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples,
LINE 120: inflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a
LINE 121: good play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish
LINE 122: or dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed
LINE 123: with all these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much
LINE 124: more than one wanting in them, like the greater number of those which
LINE 125: are commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be
LINE 126: blamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well
LINE 127: aware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; but as plays
LINE 128: have become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that the
LINE 129: actors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the
LINE 130: poet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to
LINE 131: pay him for his work. And that this is the truth may be seen by the
LINE 132: countless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written,
LINE 133: with so much brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polished
LINE 134: versification, such choice language, such profound reflections, and in
LINE 135: a word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled
LINE 136: the world with his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit
LINE 137: the taste of the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come
LINE 138: as near perfection as they ought. Others write plays with such
LINE 139: heedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly
LINE 140: and abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for
LINE 141: having acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to
LINE 142: some noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing
LINE 143: of, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person
LINE 144: at the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only
LINE 145: those produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be
LINE 146: acted in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local
LINE 147: magistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would
LINE 148: take care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them in
LINE 149: safety, and those who write them would be more careful and take more
LINE 150: pains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to the
LINE 151: strict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good plays
LINE 152: would be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as well
LINE 153: the amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of Spain, the
LINE 154: interest and safety of the actors, and the saving of trouble in
LINE 155: inflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some other person
LINE 156: were authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, no
LINE 157: doubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described,
LINE 158: enriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of
LINE 159: eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of
LINE 160: the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not
LINE 161: merely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be
LINE 162: always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful
LINE 163: amusement."
LINE 164: The canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their
LINE 165: conversation, when the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said to
LINE 166: the curate, "This is the spot, señor licentiate, that I said was a good
LINE 167: one for fresh and plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our
LINE 168: noontide rest."
LINE 169: "And so it seems," returned the curate, and he told the canon what he
LINE 170: proposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,
LINE 171: attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes;
LINE 172: and to enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he
LINE 173: had begun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the
LINE 174: doings of Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the
LINE 175: inn, which was not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there
LINE 176: might be for the whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon
LINE 177: where he was; to which one of his servants replied that the sumpter
LINE 178: mule, which by this time ought to have reached the inn, carried
LINE 179: provisions enough to make it unnecessary to get anything from the inn
LINE 180: except barley.
LINE 181: "In that case," said the canon, "take all the beasts there, and bring
LINE 182: the sumpter mule back."
LINE 183: While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his
LINE 184: master without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his
LINE 185: suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don
LINE 186: Quixote was placed, and said, "Señor, to ease my conscience I want to
LINE 187: tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that
LINE 188: these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village
LINE 189: and the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying
LINE 190: you off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship
LINE 191: surpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it
LINE 192: follows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of.
LINE 193: And to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as
LINE 194: I believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the
LINE 195: trick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in
LINE 196: your wits."
LINE 197: "Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son," returned Don Quixote, "for I will
LINE 198: satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest,
LINE 199: that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our
LINE 200: neighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to
LINE 201: be those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact,
LINE 202: believe it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is
LINE 203: that, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who
LINE 204: have enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy
LINE 205: for enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken
LINE 206: those of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead
LINE 207: thee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape
LINE 208: though thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it
LINE 209: to make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this
LINE 210: evil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the
LINE 211: barber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on
LINE 212: the other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no
LINE 213: power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut
LINE 214: me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment
LINE 215: is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the
LINE 216: histories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted? So
LINE 217: thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou
LINE 218: sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy desire
LINE 219: to ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though thou
LINE 220: shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning."
LINE 221: "May Our Lady be good to me!" said Sancho, lifting up his voice; "and
LINE 222: is it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of
LINE 223: brains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and
LINE 224: that malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than
LINE 225: enchantment? But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are
LINE 226: not enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this
LINE 227: affliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in
LINE 228: the arms of my lady Dulcinea—"
LINE 229: "Leave off conjuring me," said Don Quixote, "and ask what thou wouldst
LINE 230: know; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible
LINE 231: precision."
LINE 232: "That is what I want," said Sancho; "and what I would know, and have
LINE 233: you tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the
LINE 234: whole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who
LINE 235: profess arms, as your worship professes them, under the title of
LINE 236: knights-errant—"
LINE 237: "I tell thee I will not lie in any particular," said Don Quixote;
LINE 238: "finish thy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these
LINE 239: asseverations, requirements, and precautions, Sancho."
LINE 240: "Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master," said Sancho;
LINE 241: "and so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask,
LINE 242: speaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut
LINE 243: up and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire
LINE 244: or inclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?"
LINE 245: "I do not understand 'going anywhere,'" said Don Quixote; "explain
LINE 246: thyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to
LINE 247: the point."
LINE 248: "Is it possible," said Sancho, "that your worship does not understand
LINE 249: 'going anywhere'? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were
LINE 250: babes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do
LINE 251: what cannot be avoided?"
LINE 252: "Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "yes, often, and
LINE 253: even this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right."
