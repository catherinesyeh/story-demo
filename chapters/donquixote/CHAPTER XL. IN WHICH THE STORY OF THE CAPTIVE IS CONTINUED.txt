LINE 3: SONNET
LINE 4: "Blest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free,
LINE 5: In guerdon of brave deeds beatified,
LINE 6: Above this lowly orb of ours abide
LINE 7: Made heirs of heaven and immortality,
LINE 8: With noble rage and ardour glowing ye
LINE 9: Your strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied,
LINE 10: And with your own blood and the foeman's dyed
LINE 11: The sandy soil and the encircling sea.
LINE 12: It was the ebbing life-blood first that failed
LINE 13: The weary arms; the stout hearts never quailed.
LINE 14: Though vanquished, yet ye earned the victor's crown:
LINE 15: Though mourned, yet still triumphant was your fall
LINE 16: For there ye won, between the sword and wall,
LINE 17: In Heaven glory and on earth renown."
LINE 18: "That is it exactly, according to my recollection," said the captive.
LINE 19: "Well then, that on the fort," said the gentleman, "if my memory serves
LINE 20: me, goes thus:
LINE 21: SONNET
LINE 22: "Up from this wasted soil, this shattered shell,
LINE 23: Whose walls and towers here in ruin lie,
LINE 24: Three thousand soldier souls took wing on high,
LINE 25: In the bright mansions of the blest to dwell.
LINE 26: The onslaught of the foeman to repel
LINE 27: By might of arm all vainly did they try,
LINE 28: And when at length 'twas left them but to die,
LINE 29: Wearied and few the last defenders fell.
LINE 30: And this same arid soil hath ever been
LINE 31: A haunt of countless mournful memories,
LINE 32: As well in our day as in days of yore.
LINE 33: But never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween,
LINE 34: From its hard bosom purer souls than these,
LINE 35: Or braver bodies on its surface bore."
LINE 36: The sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the
LINE 37: tidings they gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he went
LINE 38: on to say:
LINE 39: The Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave
LINE 40: orders to dismantle the Goletta—for the fort was reduced to such a
LINE 41: state that there was nothing left to level—and to do the work more
LINE 42: quickly and easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they
LINE 43: able to blow up the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is
LINE 44: to say, the old walls, while all that remained standing of the new
LINE 45: fortifications that the Fratin had made came to the ground with the
LINE 46: greatest ease. Finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to
LINE 47: Constantinople, and a few months later died my master, El Uchali,
LINE 48: otherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish "the scabby renegade;"
LINE 49: for that he was; it is the practice with the Turks to name people from
LINE 50: some defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there are
LINE 51: among them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their
LINE 52: descent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, take
LINE 53: their names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral
LINE 54: qualities. This "scabby one" rowed at the oar as a slave of the Grand
LINE 55: Signor's for fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, in
LINE 56: resentment at having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turned
LINE 57: renegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to revenge
LINE 58: himself; and such was his valour that, without owing his advancement to
LINE 59: the base ways and means by which most favourites of the Grand Signor
LINE 60: rise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwards
LINE 61: general-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He was
LINE 62: a Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated his
LINE 63: slaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after
LINE 64: his death they were divided, as he directed by his will, between the
LINE 65: Grand Signor (who is heir of all who die and shares with the children
LINE 66: of the deceased) and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian
LINE 67: renegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by
LINE 68: Uchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most
LINE 69: favoured youths. He came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his
LINE 70: name was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and became king of Algiers.
LINE 71: With him I went there from Constantinople, rather glad to be so near
LINE 72: Spain, not that I intended to write to anyone about my unhappy lot, but
LINE 73: to try if fortune would be kinder to me in Algiers than in
LINE 74: Constantinople, where I had attempted in a thousand ways to escape
LINE 75: without ever finding a favourable time or chance; but in Algiers I
LINE 76: resolved to seek for other means of effecting the purpose I cherished
LINE 77: so dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never deserted me; and
LINE 78: when in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did not answer my
LINE 79: expectations, without giving way to despair I immediately began to look
LINE 80: out for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faint or
LINE 81: feeble it might be.
LINE 82: In this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by the
LINE 83: Turks a baño in which they confine the Christian captives, as well
LINE 84: those that are the king's as those belonging to private individuals,
LINE 85: and also what they call those of the Almacen, which is as much as to
LINE 86: say the slaves of the municipality, who serve the city in the public
LINE 87: works and other employments; but captives of this kind recover their
LINE 88: liberty with great difficulty, for, as they are public property and
LINE 89: have no particular master, there is no one with whom to treat for their
LINE 90: ransom, even though they may have the means. To these baños, as I have
LINE 91: said, some private individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing
LINE 92: their captives, especially when they are to be ransomed; because there
LINE 93: they can keep them in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives.
LINE 94: The king's captives also, that are on ransom, do not go out to work
LINE 95: with the rest of the crew, unless when their ransom is delayed; for
LINE 96: then, to make them write for it more pressingly, they compel them to
LINE 97: work and go for wood, which is no light labour.
LINE 98: I, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that
LINE 99: I was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of
LINE 100: fortune, nothing could dissuade them from including me among the
LINE 101: gentlemen and those waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me,
LINE 102: more as a mark of this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in
LINE 103: that baño with several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked
LINE 104: out as held to ransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we
LINE 105: suffered from hunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much
LINE 106: as hearing and seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of
LINE 107: cruelties my master inflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hanged
LINE 108: a man, impaled one, cut off the ears of another; and all with so little
LINE 109: provocation, or so entirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he
LINE 110: did it merely for the sake of doing it, and because he was by nature
LINE 111: murderously disposed towards the whole human race. The only one that
LINE 112: fared at all well with him was a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedra
LINE 113: by name, to whom he never gave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to be
LINE 114: given, or addressed a hard word, although he had done things that will
LINE 115: dwell in the memory of the people there for many a year, and all to
LINE 116: recover his liberty; and for the least of the many things he did we all
LINE 117: dreaded that he would be impaled, and he himself was in fear of it more
LINE 118: than once; and only that time does not allow, I could tell you now
LINE 119: something of what that soldier did, that would interest and astonish
LINE 120: you much more than the narration of my own tale.
LINE 121: To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by
LINE 122: the windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position;
LINE 123: and these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than
LINE 124: windows, and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It
LINE 125: so happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison
LINE 126: with three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we
LINE 127: could leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other
LINE 128: Christians had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from
LINE 129: one of these little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth
LINE 130: attached to the end of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as
LINE 131: if making signs to us to come and take it. We watched it, and one of
LINE 132: those who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether
LINE 133: they would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he did so the
LINE 134: reed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say
LINE 135: "no" by a shake of the head. The Christian came back, and it was again
LINE 136: lowered, making the same movements as before. Another of my comrades
LINE 137: went, and with him the same happened as with the first, and then the
LINE 138: third went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.
LINE 139: Seeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came
LINE 140: under the reed it was dropped and fell inside the baño at my feet. I
LINE 141: hastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this
LINE 142: were ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors,
LINE 143: and each worth ten reals of our money.
LINE 144: It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not
LINE 145: less than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could
LINE 146: have come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to
LINE 147: drop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was
LINE 148: intended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the
LINE 149: terrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out
LINE 150: that opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied
LINE 151: that it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this
LINE 152: kindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams
LINE 153: after the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and
LINE 154: crossing the arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window
LINE 155: a small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This
LINE 156: sign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the
LINE 157: house, and that it was she who had been so good to us; but the
LINE 158: whiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us
LINE 159: dismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christian
LINE 160: renegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and
LINE 161: gladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In all
LINE 162: our conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward
LINE 163: our sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the
LINE 164: cross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least
LINE 165: fifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any
LINE 166: other sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains to
LINE 167: ascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there were
LINE 168: any Christian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything more
LINE 169: than that he who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, Hadji
LINE 170: Morato by name, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of high dignity
LINE 171: among them. But when we least thought it was going to rain any more
LINE 172: cianis from that quarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with another
LINE 173: cloth tied in a larger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as
LINE 174: on the former occasion, the baño was deserted and unoccupied.

LINE 176: Full Size
LINE 177: We made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I
LINE 178: did; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it
LINE 179: was let drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns
LINE 180: with a paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was
LINE 181: a large cross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned
LINE 182: to the terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I
LINE 183: made signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed.
LINE 184: We were all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place;
LINE 185: and as none of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know
LINE 186: what the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding
LINE 187: someone to read it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a
LINE 188: native of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and had
LINE 189: given pledges that bound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him;
LINE 190: for it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return to
LINE 191: Christian territory, to carry about them certificates from captives of
LINE 192: mark testifying, in whatever form they can, that such and such a
LINE 193: renegade is a worthy man who has always shown kindness to Christians,
LINE 194: and is anxious to escape on the first opportunity that may present
LINE 195: itself. Some obtain these testimonials with good intentions, others put
LINE 196: them to a cunning use; for when they go to pillage on Christian
LINE 197: territory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken prisoners, they
LINE 198: produce their certificates and say that from these papers may be seen
LINE 199: the object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, and
LINE 200: that it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray. In this
LINE 201: way they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make their
LINE 202: peace with the Church before it does them any harm, and then when they
LINE 203: have the chance they return to Barbary to become what they were before.
LINE 204: Others, however, there are who procure these papers and make use of
LINE 205: them honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friend of mine, then,
LINE 206: was one of these renegades that I have described; he had certificates
LINE 207: from all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour as strongly
LINE 208: as we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would have
LINE 209: burned him alive.
LINE 210: I knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak
LINE 211: but also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I
LINE 212: asked him to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a
LINE 213: hole in my cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and
LINE 214: muttering to himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood
LINE 215: it, and he told me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to
LINE 216: tell me its meaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he
LINE 217: might do it more satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required,
LINE 218: and he set about translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he
LINE 219: said:
LINE 220: "All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and
LINE 221: you must bear in mind that when it says 'Lela Marien' it means 'Our
LINE 222: Lady the Virgin Mary.'"
LINE 223: We read the paper and it ran thus:
LINE 224: "When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the
LINE 225: Christian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela
LINE 226: Marien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,
LINE 227: but to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me
LINE 228: to go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great
LINE 229: love for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but
LINE 230: except thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and
LINE 231: beautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst
LINE 232: contrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband
LINE 233: there, and if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien
LINE 234: will find me someone to marry me. I myself have written this: have a
LINE 235: care to whom thou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all
LINE 236: perfidious. I am greatly troubled on this account, for I would not have
LINE 237: thee confide in anyone, because if my father knew it he would at once
LINE 238: fling me down a well and cover me with stones. I will put a thread to
LINE 239: the reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou hast no one to write for
LINE 240: thee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make me
LINE 241: understand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I often kiss as
LINE 242: the captive bade me, protect thee."
LINE 243: Judge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of
LINE 244: this paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade
LINE 245: perceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in
LINE 246: reality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what he
LINE 247: suspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would
LINE 248: risk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his
LINE 249: breast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image
LINE 250: represented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and
LINE 251: faithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we
LINE 252: chose to reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means
LINE 253: of her who had written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our
LINE 254: liberty, and he himself obtain the object he so much desired, his
LINE 255: restoration to the bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his
LINE 256: own sin and ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb. The
LINE 257: renegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance,
LINE 258: that with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the
LINE 259: matter, and so we gave him a full account of all, without hiding
LINE 260: anything from him. We pointed out to him the window at which the reed
LINE 261: appeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and resolved to
LINE 262: ascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also that it
LINE 263: would be advisable to answer the Moorish lady's letter, and the
LINE 264: renegade without a moment's delay took down the words I dictated to
LINE 265: him, which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of
LINE 266: importance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory, or
LINE 267: ever will while life lasts. This, then, was the answer returned to the
LINE 268: Moorish lady:
LINE 269: "The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the
LINE 270: true mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land
LINE 271: of the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be
LINE 272: pleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee,
LINE 273: for she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all
LINE 274: these Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for
LINE 275: thee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou
LINE 276: dost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has
LINE 277: given us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well,
LINE 278: as thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst
LINE 279: inform us of all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou
LINE 280: dost reach the land of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee
LINE 281: my promise upon it as a good Christian; and know that the Christians
LINE 282: keep their promises better than the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother
LINE 283: watch over thee, my Lady."
LINE 284: The paper being written and folded I waited two days until the baño was
LINE 285: empty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the
LINE 286: terrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long
LINE 287: in making its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not
LINE 288: distinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the
LINE 289: thread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the
LINE 290: paper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance
LINE 291: with the white flag of peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I
LINE 292: picked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all
LINE 293: sorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened our
LINE 294: joy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very night our
LINE 295: renegade returned and said he had learned that the Moor we had been
LINE 296: told of lived in that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that he
LINE 297: was enormously rich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of all
LINE 298: his wealth, and that it was the general opinion throughout the city
LINE 299: that she was the most beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of
LINE 300: the viceroys who came there had sought her for a wife, but that she had
LINE 301: been always unwilling to marry; and he had learned, moreover, that she
LINE 302: had a Christian slave who was now dead; all which agreed with the
LINE 303: contents of the paper. We immediately took counsel with the renegade as
LINE 304: to what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the
LINE 305: Moorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in the end it
LINE 306: was agreed that for the present we should wait for a second
LINE 307: communication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now
LINE 308: desires to be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one
LINE 309: else could find a way out of all these difficulties. When we had
LINE 310: decided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would
LINE 311: lose his life or restore us to liberty. For four days the baño was
LINE 312: filled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearance
LINE 313: for four days, but at the end of that time, when the baño was, as it
LINE 314: generally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it
LINE 315: promised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I found
LINE 316: another paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The
LINE 317: renegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read,
LINE 318: which was to this effect:
LINE 319: "I cannot think of a plan, señor, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela
LINE 320: Marien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is
LINE 321: for me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it
LINE 322: ransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of
LINE 323: the Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others;
LINE 324: and he will find me in my father's garden, which is at the Babazon gate
LINE 325: near the seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and
LINE 326: my servants. You can carry me away from there by night without any
LINE 327: danger, and bring me to the vessel. And remember thou art to be my
LINE 328: husband, else I will pray to Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not
LINE 329: trust anyone to go for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I
LINE 330: know thou wilt return more surely than any other, as thou art a
LINE 331: gentleman and a Christian. Endeavour to make thyself acquainted with
LINE 332: the garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know that the
LINE 333: baño is empty and I will give thee abundance of money. Allah protect
LINE 334: thee, señor."
LINE 335: These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing
LINE 336: them, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and
LINE 337: promised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made
LINE 338: the same offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he
LINE 339: would not on any account consent to one being set free before all went
LINE 340: together, as experience had taught him how ill those who have been set
LINE 341: free keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives of
LINE 342: distinction frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of
LINE 343: one who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to
LINE 344: arm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him, but who
LINE 345: never came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again
LINE 346: efface from the memory all the obligations in the world. And to prove
LINE 347: the truth of what he said, he told us briefly what had happened to a
LINE 348: certain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest
LINE 349: case that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and
LINE 350: marvellous things are happening every instant. In short, he ended by
LINE 351: saying that what could and ought to be done was to give the money
LINE 352: intended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him, so that he
LINE 353: might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence of
LINE 354: becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and when
LINE 355: master of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way of
LINE 356: getting us all out of the baño and putting us on board; especially if
LINE 357: the Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because
LINE 358: once free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark
LINE 359: even in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not
LINE 360: allow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel
LINE 361: for going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone
LINE 362: who buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it
LINE 363: for the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he
LINE 364: could get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him
LINE 365: in the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and
LINE 366: under cover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which case
LINE 367: he looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and my
LINE 368: comrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,
LINE 369: as the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing
LINE 370: that if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in
LINE 371: danger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with
LINE 372: Zoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore
LINE 373: resolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade's;
LINE 374: and at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that
LINE 375: we would do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as if
LINE 376: Lela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whether
LINE 377: we were to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewed
LINE 378: my promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the baño
LINE 379: chanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed
LINE 380: and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that
LINE 381: the next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father's
LINE 382: garden, but that before she went she would give us more money; and if
LINE 383: it were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us as
LINE 384: much as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, and
LINE 385: besides she kept all the keys.
LINE 386: We at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and
LINE 387: with eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian
LINE 388: merchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me
LINE 389: released on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship
LINE 390: from Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at
LINE 391: once it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been
LINE 392: for a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own
LINE 393: advantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal
LINE 394: with that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The
LINE 395: Thursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the
LINE 396: garden she gave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her
LINE 397: departure, begging me, if I were ransomed, to find out her father's
LINE 398: garden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there
LINE 399: to see her. I answered in a few words that I would do so, and that she
LINE 400: must remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers the
LINE 401: captive had taught her. This having been done, steps were taken to
LINE 402: ransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the baño, and
LINE 403: lest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money was
LINE 404: forthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devil
LINE 405: should prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for
LINE 406: though their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this
LINE 407: apprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the
LINE 408: matter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing
LINE 409: over all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety and
LINE 410: confidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangement
LINE 411: and secret to him, which might have been dangerous.
