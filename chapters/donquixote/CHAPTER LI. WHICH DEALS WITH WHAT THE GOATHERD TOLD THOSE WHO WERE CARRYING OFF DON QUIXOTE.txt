LINE 3: Three leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small,
LINE 4: is one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived
LINE 5: a farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be
LINE 6: so is the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected
LINE 7: for his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him
LINE 8: still more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such
LINE 9: exceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that
LINE 10: everyone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary
LINE 11: gifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was
LINE 12: beautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen
LINE 13: she was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad
LINE 14: through all the villages around—but why do I say the villages around,
LINE 15: merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into
LINE 16: the halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who
LINE 17: came from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious,
LINE 18: or some wonder-working image?
LINE 19: Her father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are
LINE 20: no locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than
LINE 21: her own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the
LINE 22: daughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a
LINE 23: wife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a
LINE 24: jewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her
LINE 25: countless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many who
LINE 26: felt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was
LINE 27: of the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in
LINE 28: possessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the
LINE 29: same place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her
LINE 30: father's choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us
LINE 31: his daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of
LINE 32: perplexity he resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the
LINE 33: name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that
LINE 34: as we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter
LINE 35: to choose according to her inclination—a course that is worthy of
LINE 36: imitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. I
LINE 37: do not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what is
LINE 38: contemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is
LINE 39: good and then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do not
LINE 40: know which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both off with
LINE 41: the tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound him
LINE 42: nor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio—that
LINE 43: you may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy,
LINE 44: the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it
LINE 45: must be disastrous.
LINE 46: About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the
LINE 47: son of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having
LINE 48: returned from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A
LINE 49: captain who chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him
LINE 50: off from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now
LINE 51: twelve years later the young man came back in a soldier's uniform,
LINE 52: arrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine
LINE 53: steel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in
LINE 54: another; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.
LINE 55: The peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they have
LINE 56: nothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of
LINE 57: his finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had
LINE 58: three suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match;
LINE 59: but he made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if
LINE 60: they had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a
LINE 61: display of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not
LINE 62: look upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled
LINE 63: for or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He
LINE 64: used to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza,
LINE 65: and there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he
LINE 66: told us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globe
LINE 67: he had not seen, nor battle he had not been engaged in; he had killed
LINE 68: more Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more single
LINE 69: combats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego García de
LINE 70: Paredes and a thousand others he named, and out of all he had come
LINE 71: victorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showed
LINE 72: marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were
LINE 73: gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with
LINE 74: monstrous impudence he used to say "you" to his equals and even those
LINE 75: who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his
LINE 76: deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king
LINE 77: himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a
LINE 78: musician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he
LINE 79: made it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was
LINE 80: something of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town
LINE 81: he made a ballad a league long.

LINE 84: This soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca,
LINE 85: this bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by
LINE 86: Leandra from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The
LINE 87: glitter of his showy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her
LINE 88: (for he gave away twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of his
LINE 89: exploits which he told about himself came to her ears; and in short, as
LINE 90: the devil no doubt had arranged it, she fell in love with him before
LINE 91: the presumption of making love to her had suggested itself to him; and
LINE 92: as in love-affairs none are more easily brought to an issue than those
LINE 93: which have the inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente
LINE 94: came to an understanding without any difficulty; and before any of her
LINE 95: numerous suitors had any suspicion of her design, she had already
LINE 96: carried it into effect, having left the house of her dearly beloved
LINE 97: father (for mother she had none), and disappeared from the village with
LINE 98: the soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out
LINE 99: of any of the large number he laid claim to. All the village and all
LINE 100: who heard of it were amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo
LINE 101: thunderstruck, her father full of grief, her relations indignant, the
LINE 102: authorities all in a ferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms.
LINE 103: They scoured the roads, they searched the woods and all quarters, and
LINE 104: at the end of three days they found the flighty Leandra in a mountain
LINE 105: cave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all the money and precious
LINE 106: jewels she had carried away from home with her.

LINE 109: They brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to
LINE 110: her misfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la
LINE 111: Roca had deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced
LINE 112: her to leave her father's house, as he meant to take her to the richest
LINE 113: and most delightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that
LINE 114: she, ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father,
LINE 115: and handed over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he had
LINE 116: carried her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the cave where
LINE 117: they had found her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without
LINE 118: robbing her of her honour, had taken from her everything she had, and
LINE 119: made off, leaving her in the cave, a thing that still further surprised
LINE 120: everybody. It was not easy for us to credit the young man's continence,
LINE 121: but she asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to console her
LINE 122: distressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken since the
LINE 123: jewel that once lost can never be recovered had been left to his
LINE 124: daughter. The same day that Leandra made her appearance her father
LINE 125: removed her from our sight and took her away to shut her up in a
LINE 126: convent in a town near this, in the hope that time may wear away some
LINE 127: of the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra's youth furnished an excuse
LINE 128: for her fault, at least with those to whom it was of no consequence
LINE 129: whether she was good or bad; but those who knew her shrewdness and
LINE 130: intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour to ignorance but to
LINE 131: wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is for the most
LINE 132: part flighty and ill-regulated.
LINE 133: Leandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo's eyes grew blind, or at any rate
LINE 134: found nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were in
LINE 135: darkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable
LINE 136: while Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew
LINE 137: less; we cursed the soldier's finery and railed at the carelessness of
LINE 138: Leandra's father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and
LINE 139: come to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own,
LINE 140: and I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees,
LINE 141: giving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra's
LINE 142: praises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven
LINE 143: pouring forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, many
LINE 144: more of Leandra's lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted
LINE 145: our mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the
LINE 146: place had been turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of
LINE 147: shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the name of
LINE 148: the fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her and calls her
LINE 149: capricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her as frail
LINE 150: and frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and reviles
LINE 151: her; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and in short
LINE 152: all abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this general
LINE 153: infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn without
LINE 154: ever having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail and
LINE 155: mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone
LINE 156: cause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before her
LINE 157: passion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade
LINE 158: beneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes
LINE 159: to the breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of
LINE 160: Leandra; the mountains ring with "Leandra," "Leandra" murmur the
LINE 161: brooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping
LINE 162: without hope and fearing without knowing what we fear. Of all this
LINE 163: silly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is my
LINE 164: rival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain of, he only
LINE 165: complains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which he
LINE 166: plays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show his
LINE 167: ingenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, and
LINE 168: that is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their
LINE 169: double dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and in
LINE 170: short the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections and
LINE 171: inclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I
LINE 172: made use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is a
LINE 173: female I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all my
LINE 174: fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been
LINE 175: tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close
LINE 176: by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a variety
LINE 177: of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.

LINE 179: CHAPTER LII.
LINE 180: OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH
LINE 181: THE RARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT
LINE 182: HE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION
LINE 183: c52a.jpg (40K)
LINE 184: Full Size
LINE 185: The goatherd's tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the
LINE 186: canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular
LINE 187: attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the
LINE 188: manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city
LINE 189: wit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying
LINE 190: that the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to
LINE 191: Eugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don
LINE 192: Quixote, who said to him, "Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found
LINE 193: myself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very
LINE 194: instant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that
LINE 195: convent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the
LINE 196: abbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in your
LINE 197: hands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing,
LINE 198: however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any
LINE 199: kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our Lord that
LINE 200: the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that
LINE 201: the power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then
LINE 202: I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my
LINE 203: profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and
LINE 204: needy."
LINE 205: The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote's sorry appearance and
LINE 206: looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next
LINE 207: him, "Señor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such
LINE 208: a strain?"
LINE 209: "Who should it be," said the barber, "but the famous Don Quixote of La
LINE 210: Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector
LINE 211: of damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?"
LINE 212: "That," said the goatherd, "sounds like what one reads in the books of
LINE 213: the knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it
LINE 214: is my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has
LINE 215: empty lodgings in his head."
LINE 216: "You are a great scoundrel," said Don Quixote, "and it is you who are
LINE 217: empty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that
LINE 218: bore you;" and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that
LINE 219: was near him and sent it full in the goatherd's face, with such force
LINE 220: that he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand
LINE 221: jokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying
LINE 222: no respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote,
LINE 223: and seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt have
LINE 224: throttled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue,
LINE 225: and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing
LINE 226: plates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on
LINE 227: it. Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of the
LINE 228: goatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by
LINE 229: Sancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to
LINE 230: take a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however,
LINE 231: prevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote
LINE 232: under him, and rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs that
LINE 233: the poor knight's face streamed with blood as freely as his own. The
LINE 234: canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers were
LINE 235: capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on as
LINE 236: they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone was
LINE 237: frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the
LINE 238: canon's servants, who kept him from going to his master's assistance.
LINE 239: c52b.jpg (348K)
LINE 240: Full Size
LINE 241: At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers
LINE 242: who were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a
LINE 243: trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the
LINE 244: direction whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most
LINE 245: excited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his
LINE 246: will he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well
LINE 247: pummelled, said to him, "Brother devil (for it is impossible but that
LINE 248: thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to
LINE 249: overcome mine), I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the
LINE 250: solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to
LINE 251: summon me to some new adventure." The goatherd, who was by this time
LINE 252: tired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and Don
LINE 253: Quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where
LINE 254: the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill
LINE 255: several men clad in white like penitents.
LINE 256: The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from
LINE 257: the earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising
LINE 258: processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands
LINE 259: of his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village
LINE 260: that was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was
LINE 261: on one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of
LINE 262: the penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took
LINE 263: it into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to
LINE 264: him alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more
LINE 265: confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black
LINE 266: they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and
LINE 267: discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this
LINE 268: occurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at
LINE 269: large, and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he
LINE 270: had him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he
LINE 271: mounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice
LINE 272: exclaimed to those who stood by, "Now, noble company, ye shall see how
LINE 273: important it is that there should be knights in the world professing
LINE 274: the order of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the
LINE 275: deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether
LINE 276: knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation," and so saying he
LINE 277: brought his legs to bear on Rocinante—for he had no spurs—and at a full
LINE 278: canter (for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante
LINE 279: fairly galloping) set off to encounter the penitents, though the
LINE 280: curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of
LINE 281: their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of Sancho calling
LINE 282: after him, "Where are you going, Señor Don Quixote? What devils have
LINE 283: possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me!
LINE 284: mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are carrying
LINE 285: on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Take
LINE 286: care what you are doing, señor, for this time it may be safely said you
LINE 287: don't know what you are about." Sancho laboured in vain, for his master
LINE 288: was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and
LINE 289: releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and even had
LINE 290: he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him. He
LINE 291: came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already
LINE 292: anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited
LINE 293: voice he exclaimed, "You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are
LINE 294: not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say
LINE 295: to you." The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and
LINE 296: one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by
LINE 297: the strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the
LINE 298: other ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him,
LINE 299: "Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these
LINE 300: brethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it
LINE 301: reasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short
LINE 302: enough to be said in two words."
LINE 303: "I will say it in one," replied Don Quixote, "and it is this; that at
LINE 304: once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad
LINE 305: aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and
LINE 306: that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who
LINE 307: was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not
LINE 308: permit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the
LINE 309: liberty she pines for and deserves."
LINE 310: From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman,
LINE 311: and began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on
LINE 312: Don Quixote's fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made
LINE 313: a rush at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden
LINE 314: to his comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that
LINE 315: he had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught
LINE 316: a mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with
LINE 317: the portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the
LINE 318: shoulder of Don Quixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not
LINE 319: protect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the
LINE 320: ground in a sad plight.
LINE 321: Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing,
LINE 322: seeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again,
LINE 323: for he was a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the
LINE 324: days of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's
LINE 325: shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and
LINE 326: so, fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under
LINE 327: his girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer.
LINE 328: By this time all Don Quixote's companions had come up to where he lay;
LINE 329: but the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the
LINE 330: officers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,
LINE 331: and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their
LINE 332: scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,
LINE 333: resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against
LINE 334: their assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter
LINE 335: better than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on
LINE 336: his master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable
LINE 337: lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The
LINE 338: curate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and
LINE 339: their recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both
LINE 340: parties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote
LINE 341: was, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor
LINE 342: gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his
LINE 343: eyes, "Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended
LINE 344: the course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and
LINE 345: glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee
LINE 346: will be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their
LINE 347: misdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only
LINE 348: eight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea
LINE 349: girds or surrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble,
LINE 350: encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason,
LINE 351: imitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in
LINE 352: short, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!"

LINE 355: At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the
LINE 356: first word he said was, "He who lives separated from you, sweetest
LINE 357: Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend
LINE 358: Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to
LINE 359: press the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to
LINE 360: pieces."
LINE 361: "That I will do with all my heart, señor," said Sancho; "and let us
LINE 362: return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and
LINE 363: there we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more
LINE 364: profitable and creditable to us."
LINE 365: "Thou art right, Sancho," returned Don Quixote; "It will be wise to let
LINE 366: the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off."
LINE 367: The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely
LINE 368: in doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza's
LINE 369: simplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The
LINE 370: procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;
LINE 371: the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the
LINE 372: Brotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what
LINE 373: was due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don
LINE 374: Quixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from
LINE 375: it, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all
LINE 376: separated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the
LINE 377: barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded
LINE 378: everything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked
LINE 379: his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his
LINE 380: usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end
LINE 381: of six days they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about
LINE 382: the middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the
LINE 383: people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote's cart passed.
LINE 384: They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised
LINE 385: their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to
LINE 386: bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and
LINE 387: uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay
LINE 388: on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies
LINE 389: raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions
LINE 390: on those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they
LINE 391: saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.
LINE 392: At the news of Don Quixote's arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running,
LINE 393: for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as
LINE 394: his squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if
LINE 395: the ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master
LINE 396: was.
LINE 397: "Thanks be to God," said she, "for being so good to me; but now tell
LINE 398: me, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you
LINE 399: brought me back? What shoes for your children?"
LINE 400: "I bring nothing of that sort, wife," said Sancho; "though I bring
LINE 401: other things of more consequence and value."
LINE 402: "I am very glad of that," returned his wife; "show me these things of
LINE 403: more value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer
LINE 404: my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have
LINE 405: been away."
LINE 406: "I will show them to you at home, wife," said Sancho; "be content for
LINE 407: the present; for if it please God that we should again go on our
LINE 408: travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or
LINE 409: governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the
LINE 410: best that is to be had."
LINE 411: "Heaven grant it, husband," said she, "for indeed we have need of it.
LINE 412: But tell me, what's this about islands, for I don't understand it?"
LINE 413: "Honey is not for the mouth of the ass," returned Sancho; "all in good
LINE 414: time thou shalt see, wife—nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself
LINE 415: called 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals."
LINE 416: "What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and
LINE 417: vassals?" returned Teresa Panza—for so Sancho's wife was called, though
LINE 418: they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to
LINE 419: take their husbands' surnames.
LINE 420: "Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa," said Sancho; "it
LINE 421: is enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I
LINE 422: may tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world
LINE 423: more delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a
LINE 424: knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one
LINE 425: finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,
LINE 426: ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience,
LINE 427: for out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still,
LINE 428: for all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may
LINE 429: happen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting
LINE 430: castles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the
LINE 431: maravedi to pay."
LINE 432: While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don
LINE 433: Quixote's housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid
LINE 434: him in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where
LINE 435: he was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her
LINE 436: uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his
LINE 437: escape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to
LINE 438: bring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and
LINE 439: renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored
LINE 440: heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst
LINE 441: of the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread
LINE 442: lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he
LINE 443: found himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.
LINE 444: But the author of this history, though he has devoted research and
LINE 445: industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his
LINE 446: third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them,
LINE 447: at any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely
LINE 448: preserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the
LINE 449: third time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa,
LINE 450: where he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city,
LINE 451: and that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high
LINE 452: intelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor
LINE 453: would he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not
LINE 454: produced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden
LINE 455: box, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the
LINE 456: crumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt;
LINE 457: in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic
LINE 458: character, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements,
LINE 459: and setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the
LINE 460: fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself,
LINE 461: together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character;
LINE 462: but all that could be read and deciphered were those which the
LINE 463: trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents.
LINE 464: And the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return
LINE 465: for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the
LINE 466: Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give
LINE 467: him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry
LINE 468: that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will
LINE 469: consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged
LINE 470: to seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least
LINE 471: equal in invention and not less entertaining. The first words written
LINE 472: on the parchment found in the leaden box were these:
LINE 473: THE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 474: A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA,

LINE 476: HOC SCRIPSERUNT
LINE 477: MONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 478: ON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE
LINE 479: EPITAPH
LINE 480: The scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more
LINE 481: Rich spoils than Jason's; who a point so keen
LINE 482: Had to his wit, and happier far had been
LINE 483: If his wit's weathercock a blunter bore;
LINE 484: The arm renowned far as Gaeta's shore,
LINE 485: Cathay, and all the lands that lie between;
LINE 486: The muse discreet and terrible in mien
LINE 487: As ever wrote on brass in days of yore;
LINE 488: He who surpassed the Amadises all,
LINE 489: And who as naught the Galaors accounted,
LINE 490: Supported by his love and gallantry:
LINE 491: Who made the Belianises sing small,
LINE 492: And sought renown on Rocinante mounted;
LINE 493: Here, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.
LINE 494: PANIAGUADO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 495: IN LAUDEM DULCINEAE DEL TOBOSO
LINE 496: SONNET
LINE 497: She, whose full features may be here descried,
LINE 498: High-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain,
LINE 499: Is Dulcinea, she for whom in vain
LINE 500: The great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed.
LINE 501: For her, Toboso's queen, from side to side
LINE 502: He traversed the grim sierra, the champaign
LINE 503: Of Aranjuez, and Montiel's famous plain:
LINE 504: On Rocinante oft a weary ride.
LINE 505: Malignant planets, cruel destiny,
LINE 506: Pursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame,
LINE 507: And the unconquered star of chivalry.
LINE 508: Nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim
LINE 509: Of death; he paid love's bitter penalty,
LINE 510: And left the marble to preserve his name.
LINE 511: CAPRICHOSO, A MOST ACUTE ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 512: IN PRAISE OF ROCINANTE, STEED OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA
LINE 513: SONNET
LINE 514: On that proud throne of diamantine sheen,
LINE 515: Which the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade,
LINE 516: The mad Manchegan's banner now hath been
LINE 517: By him in all its bravery displayed.
LINE 518: There hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade
LINE 519: Wherewith, achieving deeds till now unseen,
LINE 520: He slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath made
LINE 521: A novel style for our new paladin.
LINE 522: If Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul,
LINE 523: If by his progeny the fame of Greece
LINE 524: Through all the regions of the earth be spread,
LINE 525: Great Quixote crowned in grim Bellona's hall
LINE 526: To-day exalts La Mancha over these,
LINE 527: And above Greece or Gaul she holds her head.
LINE 528: Nor ends his glory here, for his good steed
LINE 529: Doth Brillador and Bayard far exceed;
LINE 530: As mettled steeds compared with Rocinante,
LINE 531: The reputation they have won is scanty.
LINE 532: BURLADOR, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 533: ON SANCHO PANZA
LINE 534: SONNET
LINE 535: The worthy Sancho Panza here you see;
LINE 536: A great soul once was in that body small,
LINE 537: Nor was there squire upon this earthly ball
LINE 538: So plain and simple, or of guile so free.
LINE 539: Within an ace of being Count was he,
LINE 540: And would have been but for the spite and gall
LINE 541: Of this vile age, mean and illiberal,
LINE 542: That cannot even let a donkey be.
LINE 543: For mounted on an ass (excuse the word),
LINE 544: By Rocinante's side this gentle squire
LINE 545: Was wont his wandering master to attend.
LINE 546: Delusive hopes that lure the common herd
LINE 547: With promises of ease, the heart's desire,
LINE 548: In shadows, dreams, and smoke ye always end.
LINE 549: CACHIDIABLO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 550: ON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE
LINE 551: EPITAPH
LINE 552: The knight lies here below,
LINE 553: Ill-errant and bruised sore,
LINE 554: Whom Rocinante bore
LINE 555: In his wanderings to and fro.
LINE 556: By the side of the knight is laid
LINE 557: Stolid man Sancho too,
LINE 558: Than whom a squire more true
LINE 559: Was not in the esquire trade.
LINE 560: TIQUITOC, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,
LINE 561: ON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
LINE 562: EPITAPH
LINE 563: Here Dulcinea lies.
LINE 564: Plump was she and robust:
LINE 565: Now she is ashes and dust:
LINE 566: The end of all flesh that dies.
LINE 567: A lady of high degree,
LINE 568: With the port of a lofty dame,
LINE 569: And the great Don Quixote's flame,
LINE 570: And the pride of her village was she.
LINE 571: These were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, the
LINE 572: writing being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the Academicians
LINE 573: to make out their meaning conjecturally. We have been informed that at
LINE 574: the cost of many sleepless nights and much toil he has succeeded, and
LINE 575: that he means to publish them in hopes of Don Quixote's third sally.
LINE 576: _"Forse altro cantera con miglior plettro."
