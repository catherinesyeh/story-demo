LINE 3: At this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, "Here, here, valiant
LINE 4: knights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong
LINE 5: arms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!"
LINE 6: Called away by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with
LINE 7: the scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that "The
LINE 8: Carolea," "The Lion of Spain," and "The Deeds of the Emperor," written
LINE 9: by Don Luis de Ávila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt
LINE 10: they were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen
LINE 11: them they would not have undergone so severe a sentence.
LINE 12: When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still
LINE 13: shouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake
LINE 14: as if he had never slept.
LINE 15: They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had
LINE 16: become a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, "Of a
LINE 17: truth, Señor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call
LINE 18: ourselves the Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the
LINE 19: Court to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having
LINE 20: carried off the honour on the three former days."
LINE 21: "Hush, gossip," said the curate; "please God, the luck may turn, and
LINE 22: what is lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your
LINE 23: worship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are
LINE 24: over-fatigued, if not badly wounded."
LINE 25: "Wounded no," said Don Quixote, "but bruised and battered no doubt, for
LINE 26: that bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,
LINE 27: and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his
LINE 28: achievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did
LINE 29: he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise
LINE 30: from this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for
LINE 31: that, I feel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to
LINE 32: avenge myself."
LINE 33: They did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he
LINE 34: fell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.
LINE 35: That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in
LINE 36: the yard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that
LINE 37: deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the
LINE 38: laziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified
LINE 39: the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.
LINE 40: One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied
LINE 41: to their friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where
LINE 42: the books were, so that when he got up he should not find them
LINE 43: (possibly the cause being removed the effect might cease), and they
LINE 44: might say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and this
LINE 45: was done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the
LINE 46: first thing he did was to go and look at his books, and not finding the
LINE 47: room where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking for
LINE 48: it. He came to the place where the door used to be, and tried it with
LINE 49: his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction without
LINE 50: saying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeper
LINE 51: whereabouts was the room that held his books.
LINE 52: The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was
LINE 53: to answer, said, "What room or what nothing is it that your worship is
LINE 54: looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for
LINE 55: the devil himself has carried all away."
LINE 56: "It was not the devil," said the niece, "but a magician who came on a
LINE 57: cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting
LINE 58: from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there
LINE 59: I know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the
LINE 60: roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he
LINE 61: had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the
LINE 62: housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud
LINE 63: voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the
LINE 64: room, he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered
LINE 65: by-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Muñaton."
LINE 66: "He must have said Friston," said Don Quixote.
LINE 67: "I don't know whether he called himself Friston or Friton," said the
LINE 68: housekeeper, "I only know that his name ended with 'ton.'"
LINE 69: "So it does," said Don Quixote, "and he is a sage magician, a great
LINE 70: enemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts
LINE 71: and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a
LINE 72: knight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be
LINE 73: unable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all
LINE 74: the ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to
LINE 75: oppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven."
LINE 76: "Who doubts that?" said the niece; "but, uncle, who mixes you up in
LINE 77: these quarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own
LINE 78: house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever
LINE 79: came of wheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back
LINE 80: shorn?"
LINE 81: "Oh, niece of mine," replied Don Quixote, "how much astray art thou in
LINE 82: thy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped
LINE 83: off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of
LINE 84: mine."
LINE 85: The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his
LINE 86: anger was kindling.
LINE 87: In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without
LINE 88: showing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and
LINE 89: during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the
LINE 90: curate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant
LINE 91: were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be
LINE 92: accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes
LINE 93: contradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed
LINE 94: this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.
LINE 95: Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his,
LINE 96: an honest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor),
LINE 97: but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over,
LINE 98: and with such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his
LINE 99: mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote,
LINE 100: among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him
LINE 101: gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an
LINE 102: island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On
LINE 103: these and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was
LINE 104: called) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his
LINE 105: neighbour.

LINE 108: Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing
LINE 109: and pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got
LINE 110: together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he
LINE 111: begged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as
LINE 112: best he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant
LINE 113: to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most
LINE 114: needful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The other
LINE 115: said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had,
LINE 116: as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote
LINE 117: hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any
LINE 118: knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no
LINE 119: instance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determined
LINE 120: to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when
LINE 121: a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the
LINE 122: first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided with
LINE 123: shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the
LINE 124: host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho
LINE 125: Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and
LINE 126: niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night,
LINE 127: and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held
LINE 128: themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.
LINE 129: Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota,
LINE 130: and longing to see himself soon governor of the island his master had
LINE 131: promised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road
LINE 132: he had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel,
LINE 133: which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for,
LINE 134: as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely,
LINE 135: the heat did not distress them.
LINE 136: And now said Sancho Panza to his master, "Your worship will take care,
LINE 137: Señor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised
LINE 138: me, for be it ever so big I'll be equal to governing it."
LINE 139: To which Don Quixote replied, "Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza,
LINE 140: that it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of
LINE 141: old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they
LINE 142: won, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in
LINE 143: so liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for
LINE 144: they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires
LINE 145: were old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days
LINE 146: and worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at
LINE 147: the most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou
LINE 148: livest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may
LINE 149: have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be
LINE 150: just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor
LINE 151: needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the
LINE 152: lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might
LINE 153: easily give thee even more than I promise thee."
LINE 154: "In that case," said Sancho Panza, "if I should become a king by one of
LINE 155: those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old
LINE 156: woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes."
LINE 157: "Well, who doubts it?" said Don Quixote.
LINE 158: "I doubt it," replied Sancho Panza, "because for my part I am persuaded
LINE 159: that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them
LINE 160: would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, señor, she is
LINE 161: not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and
LINE 162: that only with God's help."
LINE 163: "Leave it to God, Sancho," returned Don Quixote, "for he will give her
LINE 164: what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come
LINE 165: to be content with anything less than being governor of a province."
LINE 166: "I will not, señor," answered Sancho, "specially as I have a man of
LINE 167: such quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me
LINE 168: all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear."
