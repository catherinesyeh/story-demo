LINE 3: THE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM
LINE 4: Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire
LINE 5: The ruthless rigour of thy tyranny
LINE 6: From tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,
LINE 7: The very Hell will I constrain to lend
LINE 8: This stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe
LINE 9: To serve my need of fitting utterance.
LINE 10: And as I strive to body forth the tale
LINE 11: Of all I suffer, all that thou hast done,
LINE 12: Forth shall the dread voice roll, and bear along
LINE 13: Shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.
LINE 14: Then listen, not to dulcet harmony,
LINE 15: But to a discord wrung by mad despair
LINE 16: Out of this bosom's depths of bitterness,
LINE 17: To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.
LINE 18: The lion's roar, the fierce wolf's savage howl,
LINE 19: The horrid hissing of the scaly snake,
LINE 20: The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,
LINE 21: The crow's ill-boding croak, the hollow moan
LINE 22: Of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,
LINE 23: The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,
LINE 24: The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,
LINE 25: The envied owl's sad note, the wail of woe
LINE 26: That rises from the dreary choir of Hell,
LINE 27: Commingled in one sound, confusing sense,
LINE 28: Let all these come to aid my soul's complaint,
LINE 29: For pain like mine demands new modes of song.
LINE 30: No echoes of that discord shall be heard
LINE 31: Where Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks
LINE 32: Of olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks
LINE 33: Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,
LINE 34: And by a lifeless tongue in living words;
LINE 35: Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores,
LINE 36: Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;
LINE 37: Or in among the poison-breathing swarms
LINE 38: Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.
LINE 39: For, though it be to solitudes remote
LINE 40: The hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound
LINE 41: Thy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate
LINE 42: Shall carry them to all the spacious world.
LINE 43: Disdain hath power to kill, and patience dies
LINE 44: Slain by suspicion, be it false or true;
LINE 45: And deadly is the force of jealousy;
LINE 46: Long absence makes of life a dreary void;
LINE 47: No hope of happiness can give repose
LINE 48: To him that ever fears to be forgot;
LINE 49: And death, inevitable, waits in hall.
LINE 50: But I, by some strange miracle, live on
LINE 51: A prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;
LINE 52: Racked by suspicion as by certainty;
LINE 53: Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone.
LINE 54: And while I suffer thus, there comes no ray
LINE 55: Of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;
LINE 56: Nor do I look for it in my despair;
LINE 57: But rather clinging to a cureless woe,
LINE 58: All hope do I abjure for evermore.
LINE 59: Can there be hope where fear is? Were it well,
LINE 60: When far more certain are the grounds of fear?
LINE 61: Ought I to shut mine eyes to jealousy,
LINE 62: If through a thousand heart-wounds it appears?
LINE 63: Who would not give free access to distrust,
LINE 64: Seeing disdain unveiled, and—bitter change!—
LINE 65: All his suspicions turned to certainties,
LINE 66: And the fair truth transformed into a lie?
LINE 67: Oh, thou fierce tyrant of the realms of love,
LINE 68: Oh, Jealousy! put chains upon these hands,
LINE 69: And bind me with thy strongest cord, Disdain.
LINE 70: But, woe is me! triumphant over all,
LINE 71: My sufferings drown the memory of you.
LINE 72: And now I die, and since there is no hope
LINE 73: Of happiness for me in life or death,
LINE 74: Still to my fantasy I'll fondly cling.
LINE 75: I'll say that he is wise who loveth well,
LINE 76: And that the soul most free is that most bound
LINE 77: In thraldom to the ancient tyrant Love.
LINE 78: I'll say that she who is mine enemy
LINE 79: In that fair body hath as fair a mind,
LINE 80: And that her coldness is but my desert,
LINE 81: And that by virtue of the pain he sends
LINE 82: Love rules his kingdom with a gentle sway.
LINE 83: Thus, self-deluding, and in bondage sore,
LINE 84: And wearing out the wretched shred of life
LINE 85: To which I am reduced by her disdain,
LINE 86: I'll give this soul and body to the winds,
LINE 87: All hopeless of a crown of bliss in store.
LINE 88: Thou whose injustice hath supplied the cause
LINE 89: That makes me quit the weary life I loathe,
LINE 90: As by this wounded bosom thou canst see
LINE 91: How willingly thy victim I become,
LINE 92: Let not my death, if haply worth a tear,
LINE 93: Cloud the clear heaven that dwells in thy bright eyes;
LINE 94: I would not have thee expiate in aught
LINE 95: The crime of having made my heart thy prey;
LINE 96: But rather let thy laughter gaily ring
LINE 97: And prove my death to be thy festival.
LINE 98: Fool that I am to bid thee! well I know
LINE 99: Thy glory gains by my untimely end.
LINE 100: And now it is the time; from Hell's abyss
LINE 101: Come thirsting Tantalus, come Sisyphus
LINE 102: Heaving the cruel stone, come Tityus
LINE 103: With vulture, and with wheel Ixion come,
LINE 104: And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil;
LINE 105: And all into this breast transfer their pains,
LINE 106: And (if such tribute to despair be due)
LINE 107: Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge
LINE 108: Over a corse unworthy of a shroud.
LINE 109: Let the three-headed guardian of the gate,
LINE 110: And all the monstrous progeny of hell,
LINE 111: The doleful concert join: a lover dead
LINE 112: Methinks can have no fitter obsequies.
LINE 113: Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone
LINE 114: Forth from this sorrowing heart: my misery
LINE 115: Brings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth;
LINE 116: Then banish sadness even in the tomb.
LINE 117: The "Lay of Chrysostom" met with the approbation of the listeners,
LINE 118: though the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had
LINE 119: heard of Marcela's reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in
LINE 120: it of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the
LINE 121: good name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who
LINE 122: knew well his friend's most secret thoughts, "Señor, to remove that
LINE 123: doubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was
LINE 124: away from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to
LINE 125: try if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything
LINE 126: distresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary
LINE 127: jealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormented
LINE 128: Chrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of
LINE 129: Marcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not and
LINE 130: cannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, and
LINE 131: very scornful."
LINE 132: "That is true," said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper
LINE 133: of those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous
LINE 134: vision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their
LINE 135: eyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave
LINE 136: there appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty
LINE 137: exceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed
LINE 138: upon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see
LINE 139: her were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But
LINE 140: the instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest
LINE 141: indignation:
LINE 142: "Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if
LINE 143: in thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being
LINE 144: thy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work
LINE 145: of thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to
LINE 146: look down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in
LINE 147: thy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful
LINE 148: daughter trampled on her father Tarquin's? Tell us quickly for what
LINE 149: thou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the
LINE 150: thoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make
LINE 151: all these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though he be
LINE 152: dead."
LINE 153: "I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named," replied
LINE 154: Marcela, "but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all
LINE 155: those who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; and
LINE 156: therefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for
LINE 157: it will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to
LINE 158: persons of sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so
LINE 159: much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and
LINE 160: for the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to
LINE 161: love you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I know
LINE 162: that everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by
LINE 163: reason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to
LINE 164: love that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that
LINE 165: which is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is
LINE 166: very absurd to say, "I love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must
LINE 167: love me though I be ugly." But supposing the beauty equal on both
LINE 168: sides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore
LINE 169: alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing
LINE 170: the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty
LINE 171: excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and
LINE 172: fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of
LINE 173: beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true
LINE 174: love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and
LINE 175: not compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire
LINE 176: me to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you
LINE 177: love me? Nay—tell me—had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me
LINE 178: beautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?
LINE 179: Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of
LINE 180: mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without
LINE 181: my asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it,
LINE 182: does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a
LINE 183: gift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for
LINE 184: beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword;
LINE 185: the one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come
LINE 186: too near. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without
LINE 187: which the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful;
LINE 188: but if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and
LINE 189: charm to mind and body, why should she who is loved for her beauty part
LINE 190: with it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his
LINE 191: might and energy to rob her of it? I was born free, and that I might
LINE 192: live in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the
LINE 193: mountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my
LINE 194: mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and
LINE 195: charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I have
LINE 196: inspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived,
LINE 197: and if their longings live on hope—and I have given none to Chrysostom
LINE 198: or to any other—it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my
LINE 199: doing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed
LINE 200: him; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were
LINE 201: honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answer
LINE 202: that when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to
LINE 203: me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetual
LINE 204: solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my
LINE 205: retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal,
LINE 206: he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what
LINE 207: wonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I
LINE 208: had encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should
LINE 209: have acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was
LINE 210: persistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated.
LINE 211: Bethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid
LINE 212: to my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way
LINE 213: to despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter
LINE 214: himself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but
LINE 215: let not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon
LINE 216: whom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It has
LINE 217: not been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to
LINE 218: expect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general declaration serve
LINE 219: for each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be understood
LINE 220: from this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy
LINE 221: or misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause for
LINE 222: jealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Let
LINE 223: him who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as something
LINE 224: noxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold his
LINE 225: service; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me
LINE 226: cruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this
LINE 227: ungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve,
LINE 228: know, or follow them. If Chrysostom's impatience and violent passion
LINE 229: killed him, why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be
LINE 230: blamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should
LINE 231: he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? I
LINE 232: have, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; my
LINE 233: taste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neither
LINE 234: love nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or
LINE 235: trifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of the
LINE 236: shepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my
LINE 237: recreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if they
LINE 238: ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps
LINE 239: by which the soul travels to its primeval abode."
LINE 240: With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and
LINE 241: passed into the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all
LINE 242: who were there lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her
LINE 243: beauty. Some—those wounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her
LINE 244: bright eyes—made as though they would follow her, heedless of the frank
LINE 245: declaration they had heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting
LINE 246: occasion for the exercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels,
LINE 247: Don Quixote, laying his hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a
LINE 248: loud and distinct voice:
LINE 249: "Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the
LINE 250: beautiful Marcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She
LINE 251: has shown by clear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault
LINE 252: is to be found with her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far
LINE 253: she is from yielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which
LINE 254: reason, instead of being followed and persecuted, she should in justice
LINE 255: be honoured and esteemed by all the good people of the world, for she
LINE 256: shows that she is the only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous
LINE 257: resolution."
LINE 258: Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because
LINE 259: Ambrosio told them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of
LINE 260: the shepherds moved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the
LINE 261: grave and burned Chrysostom's papers, they laid his body in it, not
LINE 262: without many tears from those who stood by. They closed the grave with
LINE 263: a heavy stone until a slab was ready which Ambrosio said he meant to
LINE 264: have prepared, with an epitaph which was to be to this effect:
LINE 265: Beneath the stone before your eyes
LINE 266: The body of a lover lies;
LINE 267: In life he was a shepherd swain,
LINE 268: In death a victim to disdain.
LINE 269: Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,
LINE 270: Was she that drove him to despair,
LINE 271: And Love hath made her his ally
LINE 272: For spreading wide his tyranny.
LINE 273: They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches,
LINE 274: and all expressing their condolence with his friend Ambrosio, took
LINE 275: their leave. Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixote
LINE 276: bade farewell to his hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to
LINE 277: come with them to Seville, as being such a convenient place for finding
LINE 278: adventures, for they presented themselves in every street and round
LINE 279: every corner oftener than anywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for
LINE 280: their advice and for the disposition they showed to do him a favour,
LINE 281: and said that for the present he would not, and must not go to Seville
LINE 282: until he had cleared all these mountains of highwaymen and robbers, of
LINE 283: whom report said they were full. Seeing his good intention, the
LINE 284: travellers were unwilling to press him further, and once more bidding
LINE 285: him farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course of
LINE 286: which they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom
LINE 287: as well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, resolved to go
LINE 288: in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her of all the
LINE 289: service he could render her; but things did not fall out with him as he
LINE 290: expected, according to what is related in the course of this veracious
LINE 291: history, of which the Second Part ends here.
