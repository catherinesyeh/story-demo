LINE 1: I
LINE 2: The death of the Prince Consort was the central turning-point in the
LINE 3: history of Queen Victoria. She herself felt that her true life had
LINE 4: ceased with her husband's, and that the remainder of her days upon earth
LINE 5: was of a twilight nature--an epilogue to a drama that was done. Nor is
LINE 6: it possible that her biographer should escape a similar impression. For
LINE 7: him, too, there is a darkness over the latter half of that long career.
LINE 8: The first forty--two years of the Queen's life are illuminated by a
LINE 9: great and varied quantity of authentic information. With Albert's
LINE 10: death a veil descends. Only occasionally, at fitful and disconnected
LINE 11: intervals, does it lift for a moment or two; a few main outlines, a
LINE 12: few remarkable details may be discerned; the rest is all conjecture and
LINE 13: ambiguity. Thus, though the Queen survived her great bereavement for
LINE 14: almost as many years as she had lived before it, the chronicle of those
LINE 15: years can bear no proportion to the tale of her earlier life. We must be
LINE 16: content in our ignorance with a brief and summary relation.
LINE 17: The sudden removal of the Prince was not merely a matter of overwhelming
LINE 18: personal concern to Victoria; it was an event of national, of European
LINE 19: importance. He was only forty-two, and in the ordinary course of nature
LINE 20: he might have been expected to live at least thirty years longer. Had
LINE 21: he done so it can hardly be doubted that the whole development of the
LINE 22: English polity would have been changed. Already at the time of his death
LINE 23: he filled a unique place in English public life; already among the inner
LINE 24: circle of politicians he was accepted as a necessary and useful part of
LINE 25: the mechanism of the State. Lord Clarendon, for instance, spoke of his
LINE 26: death as "a national calamity of far greater importance than the public
LINE 27: dream of," and lamented the loss of his "sagacity and foresight," which,
LINE 28: he declared, would have been "more than ever valuable" in the event of
LINE 29: an American war. And, as time went on, the Prince's influence must have
LINE 30: enormously increased. For, in addition to his intellectual and moral
LINE 31: qualities, he enjoyed, by virtue of his position, one supreme advantage
LINE 32: which every other holder of high office in the country was without: he
LINE 33: was permanent. Politicians came and went, but the Prince was perpetually
LINE 34: installed at the centre of affairs. Who can doubt that, towards the end
LINE 35: of the century, such a man, grown grey in the service of the nation,
LINE 36: virtuous, intelligent, and with the unexampled experience of a whole
LINE 37: life-time of government, would have acquired an extraordinary prestige?
LINE 38: If, in his youth, he had been able to pit the Crown against the mighty
LINE 39: Palmerston and to come off with equal honours from the contest, of what
LINE 40: might he not have been capable in his old age? What Minister,
LINE 41: however able, however popular, could have withstood the wisdom, the
LINE 42: irreproachability, the vast prescriptive authority, of the venerable
LINE 43: Prince? It is easy to imagine how, under such a ruler, an attempt might
LINE 44: have been made to convert England into a State as exactly organised,
LINE 45: as elaborately trained, as efficiently equipped, and as autocratically
LINE 46: controlled, as Prussia herself. Then perhaps, eventually, under some
LINE 47: powerful leader--a Gladstone or a Bright--the democratic forces in the
LINE 48: country might have rallied together, and a struggle might have followed
LINE 49: in which the Monarchy would have been shaken to its foundations. Or, on
LINE 50: the other hand, Disraeli's hypothetical prophecy might have come true.
LINE 51: "With Prince Albert," he said, "we have buried our... sovereign. This
LINE 52: German Prince has governed England for twenty-one years with a wisdom
LINE 53: and energy such as none of our kings have ever shown. If he had outlived
LINE 54: some of our 'old stagers' he would have given us the blessings of
LINE 55: absolute government."
LINE 56: The English Constitution--that indescribable entity--is a living thing,
LINE 57: growing with the growth of men, and assuming ever-varying forms in
LINE 58: accordance with the subtle and complex laws of human character. It is
LINE 59: the child of wisdom and chance. The wise men of 1688 moulded it into the
LINE 60: shape we know, but the chance that George I could not speak English
LINE 61: gave it one of its essential peculiarities--the system of a Cabinet
LINE 62: independent of the Crown and subordinate to the Prime Minister. The
LINE 63: wisdom of Lord Grey saved it from petrifaction and destruction, and
LINE 64: set it upon the path of Democracy. Then chance intervened once more; a
LINE 65: female sovereign happened to marry an able and pertinacious man; and
LINE 66: it seemed likely that an element which had been quiescent within it for
LINE 67: years--the element of irresponsible administrative power--was about
LINE 68: to become its predominant characteristic and to change completely the
LINE 69: direction of its growth. But what chance gave chance took away. The
LINE 70: Consort perished in his prime; and the English Constitution, dropping
LINE 71: the dead limb with hardly a tremor, continued its mysterious life as if
LINE 72: he had never been.
LINE 73: One human being, and one alone, felt the full force of what had
LINE 74: happened. The Baron, by his fireside at Coburg, suddenly saw the
LINE 75: tremendous fabric of his creation crash down into sheer and irremediable
LINE 76: ruin. Albert was gone, and he had lived in vain. Even his blackest
LINE 77: hypochondria had never envisioned quite so miserable a catastrophe.
LINE 78: Victoria wrote to him, visited him, tried to console him by declaring
LINE 79: with passionate conviction that she would carry on her husband's work.
LINE 80: He smiled a sad smile and looked into the fire. Then he murmured that
LINE 81: he was going where Albert was--that he would not be long. He shrank into
LINE 82: himself. His children clustered round him and did their best to comfort
LINE 83: him, but it was useless: the Baron's heart was broken. He lingered for
LINE 84: eighteen months, and then, with his pupil, explored the shadow and the
LINE 85: dust.
LINE 86: II
LINE 87: With appalling suddenness Victoria had exchanged the serene radiance of
LINE 88: happiness for the utter darkness of woe. In the first dreadful moments
LINE 89: those about her had feared that she might lose her reason, but the iron
LINE 90: strain within her held firm, and in the intervals between the intense
LINE 91: paroxysms of grief it was observed that the Queen was calm. She
LINE 92: remembered, too, that Albert had always disapproved of exaggerated
LINE 93: manifestations of feeling, and her one remaining desire was to do
LINE 94: nothing but what he would have wished. Yet there were moments when
LINE 95: her royal anguish would brook no restraints. One day she sent for the
LINE 96: Duchess of Sutherland, and, leading her to the Prince's room, fell
LINE 97: prostrate before his clothes in a flood of weeping, while she adjured
LINE 98: the Duchess to tell her whether the beauty of Albert's character had
LINE 99: ever been surpassed. At other times a feeling akin to indignation swept
LINE 100: over her. "The poor fatherless baby of eight months," she wrote to the
LINE 101: King of the Belgians, "is now the utterly heartbroken and crushed widow
LINE 102: of forty-two! My LIFE as a HAPPY one is ENDED! The world is gone for
LINE 103: ME!... Oh! to be cut off in the prime of life--to see our pure, happy,
LINE 104: quiet, domestic life, which ALONE enabled me to bear my MUCH disliked
LINE 105: position, CUT OFF at forty-two--when I HAD hoped with such instinctive
LINE 106: certainty that God never WOULD part us, and would let us grow old
LINE 107: together (though HE always talked of the shortness of life)--is TOO
LINE 108: AWFUL, too cruel!" The tone of outraged Majesty seems to be discernible.
LINE 109: Did she wonder in her heart of hearts how the Deity could have dared?
LINE 110: But all other emotions gave way before her overmastering determination
LINE 111: to continue, absolutely unchanged, and for the rest of her life on
LINE 112: earth, her reverence, her obedience, her idolatry. "I am anxious to
LINE 113: repeat ONE thing," she told her uncle, "and THAT ONE is my firm resolve,
LINE 114: my IRREVOCABLE DECISION, viz., that HIS wishes--HIS plans--about
LINE 115: everything, HIS views about EVERY thing are to be MY LAW! And NO HUMAN
LINE 116: POWER will make me swerve from WHAT HE decided and wished." She grew
LINE 117: fierce, she grew furious, at the thought of any possible intrusion
LINE 118: between her and her desire. Her uncle was coming to visit her, and it
LINE 119: flashed upon her that HE might try to interfere with her and seek
LINE 120: to "rule the roost" as of old. She would give him a hint. "I am ALSO
LINE 121: DETERMINED," she wrote, "that NO ONE person--may HE be ever so good,
LINE 122: ever so devoted among my servants--is to lead or guide or dictate TO ME.
LINE 123: I know HOW he would disapprove it... Though miserably weak and utterly
LINE 124: shattered, my spirit rises when I think ANY wish or plan of his is to
LINE 125: be touched or changed, or I am to be MADE TO DO anything." She ended her
LINE 126: letter in grief and affection. She was, she said, his "ever wretched but
LINE 127: devoted child, Victoria R." And then she looked at the date: it was the
LINE 128: 24th of December. An agonising pang assailed her, and she dashed down a
LINE 129: postcript--"What a Xmas! I won't think of it."
LINE 130: At first, in the tumult of her distresses, she declared that she could
LINE 131: not see her Ministers, and the Princess Alice, assisted by Sir Charles
LINE 132: Phipps, the keeper of the Privy Purse, performed, to the best of her
LINE 133: ability, the functions of an intermediary. After a few weeks, however,
LINE 134: the Cabinet, through Lord John Russell, ventured to warn the Queen that
LINE 135: this could not continue. She realised that they were right: Albert would
LINE 136: have agreed with them; and so she sent for the Prime Minister. But when
LINE 137: Lord Palmerston arrived at Osborne, in the pink of health, brisk, with
LINE 138: his whiskers freshly dyed, and dressed in a brown overcoat, light grey
LINE 139: trousers, green gloves, and blue studs, he did not create a very good
LINE 140: impression.
LINE 141: Nevertheless, she had grown attached to her old enemy, and the thought
LINE 142: of a political change filled her with agitated apprehensions. The
LINE 143: Government, she knew, might fall at any moment; she felt she could not
LINE 144: face such an eventuality; and therefore, six months after the death of
LINE 145: the Prince, she took the unprecedented step of sending a private message
LINE 146: to Lord Derby, the leader of the Opposition, to tell him that she was
LINE 147: not in a fit state of mind or body to undergo the anxiety of a change of
LINE 148: Government, and that if he turned the present Ministers out of office it
LINE 149: would be at the risk of sacrificing her life--or her reason. When this
LINE 150: message reached Lord Derby he was considerably surprised. "Dear me!" was
LINE 151: his cynical comment. "I didn't think she was so fond of them as THAT."
LINE 152: Though the violence of her perturbations gradually subsided, her
LINE 153: cheerfulness did not return. For months, for years, she continued in
LINE 154: settled gloom. Her life became one of almost complete seclusion. Arrayed
LINE 155: in thickest crepe, she passed dolefully from Windsor to Osborne, from
LINE 156: Osborne to Balmoral. Rarely visiting the capital, refusing to take any
LINE 157: part in the ceremonies of state, shutting herself off from the slightest
LINE 158: intercourse with society, she became almost as unknown to her subjects
LINE 159: as some potentate of the East. They might murmur, but they did not
LINE 160: understand. What had she to do with empty shows and vain enjoyments? No!
LINE 161: She was absorbed by very different preoccupations. She was the devoted
LINE 162: guardian of a sacred trust. Her place was in the inmost shrine of the
LINE 163: house of mourning--where she alone had the right to enter, where she
LINE 164: could feel the effluence of a mysterious presence, and interpret,
LINE 165: however faintly and feebly, the promptings of a still living soul. That,
LINE 166: and that only was her glorious, her terrible duty. For terrible indeed
LINE 167: it was. As the years passed her depression seemed to deepen and her
LINE 168: loneliness to grow more intense. "I am on a dreary sad pinnacle of
LINE 169: solitary grandeur," she said. Again and again she felt that she could
LINE 170: bear her situation no longer--that she would sink under the strain. And
LINE 171: then, instantly, that Voice spoke: and she braced herself once more to
LINE 172: perform, with minute conscientiousness, her grim and holy task.
LINE 173: Above all else, what she had to do was to make her own the
LINE 174: master-impulse of Albert's life--she must work, as he had worked, in the
LINE 175: service of the country. That vast burden of toil which he had taken upon
LINE 176: his shoulders it was now for her to bear. She assumed the gigantic
LINE 177: load; and naturally she staggered under it. While he had lived, she had
LINE 178: worked, indeed, with regularity and conscientiousness; but it was work
LINE 179: made easy, made delicious, by his care, his forethought, his advice,
LINE 180: and his infallibility. The mere sound of his voice, asking her to sign
LINE 181: a paper, had thrilled her; in such a presence she could have laboured
LINE 182: gladly for ever. But now there was a hideous change. Now there were no
LINE 183: neat piles and docketings under the green lamp; now there were no simple
LINE 184: explanations of difficult matters; now there was nobody to tell her what
LINE 185: was right and what was wrong. She had her secretaries, no doubt: there
LINE 186: were Sir Charles Phipps, and General Grey, and Sir Thomas Biddulph; and
LINE 187: they did their best. But they were mere subordinates: the whole weight
LINE 188: of initiative and responsibility rested upon her alone. For so it had to
LINE 189: be. "I am DETERMINED"--had she not declared it?--"that NO ONE person is
LINE 190: to lead or guide or dictate to ME;" anything else would be a betrayal of
LINE 191: her trust. She would follow the Prince in all things. He had refused to
LINE 192: delegate authority; he had examined into every detail with his own eyes;
LINE 193: he had made it a rule never to sign a paper without having first, not
LINE 194: merely read it, but made notes on it too. She would do the same. She
LINE 195: sat from morning till night surrounded by huge heaps of despatch--boxes,
LINE 196: reading and writing at her desk--at her desk, alas! which stood alone
LINE 197: now in the room.
LINE 198: Within two years of Albert's death a violent disturbance in foreign
LINE 199: politics put Victoria's faithfulness to a crucial test. The fearful
LINE 200: Schleswig-Holstein dispute, which had been smouldering for more than a
LINE 201: decade, showed signs of bursting out into conflagration. The complexity
LINE 202: of the questions at issue was indescribable. "Only three people,"
LINE 203: said Palmerston, "have ever really understood the Schleswig-Holstein
LINE 204: business--the Prince Consort, who is dead--a German professor, who
LINE 205: has gone mad--and I, who have forgotten all about it." But, though the
LINE 206: Prince might be dead, had he not left a vicegerent behind him?
LINE 207: Victoria threw herself into the seething embroilment with the vigour of
LINE 208: inspiration. She devoted hours daily to the study of the affair in all
LINE 209: its windings; but she had a clue through the labyrinth: whenever the
LINE 210: question had been discussed, Albert, she recollected it perfectly, had
LINE 211: always taken the side of Prussia. Her course was clear. She became an
LINE 212: ardent champion of the Prussian point of view. It was a legacy from the
LINE 213: Prince, she said. She did not realise that the Prussia of the Prince's
LINE 214: day was dead, and that a new Prussia, the Prussia of Bismarck, was born.
LINE 215: Perhaps Palmerston, with his queer prescience, instinctively apprehended
LINE 216: the new danger; at any rate, he and Lord John were agreed upon the
LINE 217: necessity of supporting Denmark against Prussia's claims. But opinion
LINE 218: was sharply divided, not only in the country but in the Cabinet. For
LINE 219: eighteen months the controversy raged; while the Queen, with persistent
LINE 220: vehemence, opposed the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. When at
LINE 221: last the final crisis arose--when it seemed possible that England would
LINE 222: join forces with Denmark in a war against Prussia--Victoria's agitation
LINE 223: grew febrile in its intensity. Towards her German relatives she
LINE 224: preserved a discreet appearance of impartiality; but she poured out
LINE 225: upon her Ministers a flood of appeals, protests, and expostulations. She
LINE 226: invoked the sacred cause of Peace. "The only chance of preserving peace
LINE 227: for Europe," she wrote, "is by not assisting Denmark, who has brought
LINE 228: this entirely upon herself. The Queen suffers much, and her nerves
LINE 229: are more and more totally shattered... But though all this anxiety is
LINE 230: wearing her out, it will not shake her firm purpose of resisting any
LINE 231: attempt to involve this country in a mad and useless combat." She was,
LINE 232: she declared, "prepared to make a stand," even if the resignation of the
LINE 233: Foreign Secretary should follow. "The Queen," she told Lord Granville,
LINE 234: "is completely exhausted by the anxiety and suspense, and misses her
LINE 235: beloved husband's help, advice, support, and love in an overwhelming
LINE 236: manner." She was so worn out by her efforts for peace that she could
LINE 237: "hardly hold up her head or hold her pen." England did not go to war,
LINE 238: and Denmark was left to her fate; but how far the attitude of the Queen
LINE 239: contributed to this result it is impossible, with our present knowledge,
LINE 240: to say. On the whole, however, it seems probable that the determining
LINE 241: factor in the situation was the powerful peace party in the Cabinet
LINE 242: rather than the imperious and pathetic pressure of Victoria.
LINE 243: It is, at any rate, certain that the Queen's enthusiasm for the sacred
LINE 244: cause of peace was short-lived. Within a few months her mind had
LINE 245: completely altered. Her eyes were opened to the true nature of Prussia,
LINE 246: whose designs upon Austria were about to culminate in the Seven Weeks'
LINE 247: War. Veering precipitately from one extreme to the other, she now urged
LINE 248: her Ministers to interfere by force of arms in support of Austria. But
LINE 249: she urged in vain.
LINE 250: Her political activity, no more than her social seclusion, was approved
LINE 251: by the public. As the years passed, and the royal mourning remained
LINE 252: as unrelieved as ever, the animadversions grew more general and more
LINE 253: severe. It was observed that the Queen's protracted privacy not only
LINE 254: cast a gloom over high society, not only deprived the populace of its
LINE 255: pageantry, but also exercised a highly deleterious effect upon the
LINE 256: dressmaking, millinery, and hosiery trades. This latter consideration
LINE 257: carried great weight. At last, early in 1864, the rumour spread that Her
LINE 258: Majesty was about to go out of mourning, and there was much rejoicing
LINE 259: in the newspapers; but unfortunately it turned out that the rumour was
LINE 260: quite without foundation. Victoria, with her own hand, wrote a letter
LINE 261: to The Times to say so. "This idea," she declared, "cannot be too
LINE 262: explicitly contradicted. The Queen," the letter continued, "heartily
LINE 263: appreciates the desire of her subjects to see her, and whatever she CAN
LINE 264: do to gratify them in this loyal and affectionate wish, she WILL do...
LINE 265: But there are other and higher duties than those of mere representation
LINE 266: which are now thrown upon the Queen, alone and unassisted--duties which
LINE 267: she cannot neglect without injury to the public service, which weigh
LINE 268: unceasingly upon her, overwhelming her with work and anxiety." The
LINE 269: justification might have been considered more cogent had it not been
LINE 270: known that those "other and higher duties" emphasised by the Queen
LINE 271: consisted for the most part of an attempt to counteract the
LINE 272: foreign policy of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell. A large
LINE 273: section--perhaps a majority--of the nation were violent partisans of
LINE 274: Denmark in the Schleswig-Holstein quarrel; and Victoria's support of
LINE 275: Prussia was widely denounced. A wave of unpopularity, which reminded
LINE 276: old observers of the period preceding the Queen's marriage more than
LINE 277: twenty-five years before, was beginning to rise. The press was rude;
LINE 278: Lord Ellenborough attacked the Queen in the House of Lords; there
LINE 279: were curious whispers in high quarters that she had had thoughts of
LINE 280: abdicating--whispers followed by regrets that she had not done so.
LINE 281: Victoria, outraged and injured, felt that she was misunderstood. She
LINE 282: was profoundly unhappy. After Lord Ellenborough's speech, General Grey
LINE 283: declared that he "had never seen the Queen so completely upset."
LINE 284: "Oh, how fearful it is," she herself wrote to Lord Granville, "to be
LINE 285: suspected--uncheered--unguided and unadvised--and how alone the poor
LINE 286: Queen feels!" Nevertheless, suffer as she might, she was as resolute
LINE 287: as ever; she would not move by a hair's breadth from the course that a
LINE 288: supreme obligation marked out for her; she would be faithful to the end.
LINE 289: And so, when Schleswig-Holstein was forgotten, and even the image of the
LINE 290: Prince had begun to grow dim in the fickle memories of men, the solitary
LINE 291: watcher remained immutably concentrated at her peculiar task. The
LINE 292: world's hostility, steadily increasing, was confronted and outfaced by
LINE 293: the impenetrable weeds of Victoria. Would the world never understand?
LINE 294: It was not mere sorrow that kept her so strangely sequestered; it was
LINE 295: devotion, it was self-immolation; it was the laborious legacy of love.
LINE 296: Unceasingly the pen moved over the black-edged paper. The flesh might be
LINE 297: weak, but that vast burden must be borne. And fortunately, if the world
LINE 298: would not understand, there were faithful friends who did. There was
LINE 299: Lord Granville, and there was kind Mr. Theodore Martin. Perhaps Mr.
LINE 300: Martin, who was so clever, would find means to make people realise the
LINE 301: facts. She would send him a letter, pointing out her arduous labours and
LINE 302: the difficulties under which she struggled, and then he might write an
LINE 303: article for one of the magazines. "It is not," she told him in 1863,
LINE 304: "the Queen's SORROW that keeps her secluded. It is her OVERWHELMING WORK
LINE 305: and her health, which is greatly shaken by her sorrow, and the totally
LINE 306: overwhelming amount of work and responsibility--work which she feels
LINE 307: really wears her out. Alice Helps was wonderfully struck at the Queen's
LINE 308: room; and if Mrs. Martin will look at it, she can tell Mr. Martin what
LINE 309: surrounds her. From the hour she gets out of bed till she gets into it
LINE 310: again there is work, work, work,--letter-boxes, questions, etc., which
LINE 311: are dreadfully exhausting--and if she had not comparative rest and
LINE 312: quiet in the evening she would most likely not be ALIVE. Her brain is
LINE 313: constantly overtaxed." It was too true.
LINE 314: III
LINE 315: To carry on Albert's work--that was her first duty; but there was
LINE 316: another, second only to that, and yet nearer, if possible, to her
LINE 317: heart--to impress the true nature of his genius and character upon the
LINE 318: minds of her subjects. She realised that during his life he had not been
LINE 319: properly appreciated; the full extent of his powers, the supreme quality
LINE 320: of his goodness, had been necessarily concealed; but death had removed
LINE 321: the need of barriers, and now her husband, in his magnificent entirety,
LINE 322: should stand revealed to all. She set to work methodically. She directed
LINE 323: Sir Arthur Helps to bring out a collection of the Prince's speeches and
LINE 324: addresses, and the weighty tome appeared in 1862. Then she commanded
LINE 325: General Grey to write an account of the Prince's early years--from his
LINE 326: birth to his marriage; she herself laid down the design of the book,
LINE 327: contributed a number of confidential documents, and added numerous
LINE 328: notes; General Grey obeyed, and the work was completed in 1866. But
LINE 329: the principal part of the story was still untold, and Mr. Martin
LINE 330: was forthwith instructed to write a complete biography of the Prince
LINE 331: Consort. Mr. Martin laboured for fourteen years. The mass of material
LINE 332: with which he had to deal was almost incredible, but he was extremely
LINE 333: industrious, and he enjoyed throughout the gracious assistance of Her
LINE 334: Majesty. The first bulky volume was published in 1874; four others
LINE 335: slowly followed; so that it was not until 1880 that the monumental work
LINE 336: was finished.
LINE 337: Mr. Martin was rewarded by a knighthood; and yet it was sadly evident
LINE 338: that neither Sir Theodore nor his predecessors had achieved the
LINE 339: purpose which the Queen had in view. Perhaps she was unfortunate in her
LINE 340: coadjutors, but, in reality, the responsibility for the failure must lie
LINE 341: with Victoria herself. Sir Theodore and the others faithfully carried
LINE 342: out the task which she had set them--faithfully put before the public
LINE 343: the very image of Albert that filled her own mind. The fatal drawback
LINE 344: was that the public did not find that image attractive. Victoria's
LINE 345: emotional nature, far more remarkable for vigour than for subtlety,
LINE 346: rejecting utterly the qualifications which perspicuity, or humour,
LINE 347: might suggest, could be satisfied with nothing but the absolute and the
LINE 348: categorical. When she disliked she did so with an unequivocal emphasis
LINE 349: which swept the object of her repugnance at once and finally outside
LINE 350: the pale of consideration; and her feelings of affection were equally
LINE 351: unmitigated. In the case of Albert her passion for superlatives
LINE 352: reached its height. To have conceived of him as anything short of
LINE 353: perfect--perfect in virtue, in wisdom, in beauty, in all the glories and
LINE 354: graces of man--would have been an unthinkable blasphemy: perfect he
LINE 355: was, and perfect he must be shown to have been. And so, Sir Arthur, Sir
LINE 356: Theodore, and the General painted him. In the circumstances, and under
LINE 357: such supervision, to have done anything else would have required talents
LINE 358: considerably more distinguished than any that those gentlemen possessed.
LINE 359: But that was not all. By a curious mischance Victoria was also able to
LINE 360: press into her service another writer, the distinction of whose talents
LINE 361: was this time beyond a doubt. The Poet Laureate, adopting, either from
LINE 362: complaisance or conviction, the tone of his sovereign, joined in the
LINE 363: chorus, and endowed the royal formula with the magical resonance of
LINE 364: verse. This settled the matter. Henceforward it was impossible to forget
LINE 365: that Albert had worn the white flower of a blameless life.
LINE 366: The result was doubly unfortunate. Victoria, disappointed and chagrined,
LINE 367: bore a grudge against her people for their refusal, in spite of all her
LINE 368: efforts, to rate her husband at his true worth. She did not understand
LINE 369: that the picture of an embodied perfection is distasteful to the
LINE 370: majority of mankind. The cause of this is not so much an envy of the
LINE 371: perfect being as a suspicion that he must be inhuman; and thus it
LINE 372: happened that the public, when it saw displayed for its admiration a
LINE 373: figure resembling the sugary hero of a moral story-book rather than a
LINE 374: fellow man of flesh and blood, turned away with a shrug, a smile, and
LINE 375: a flippant ejaculation. But in this the public was the loser as well as
LINE 376: Victoria. For in truth Albert was a far more interesting personage than
LINE 377: the public dreamed. By a curious irony an impeccable waxwork had been
LINE 378: fixed by the Queen's love in the popular imagination, while the creature
LINE 379: whom it represented--the real creature, so full of energy and stress
LINE 380: and torment, so mysterious and so unhappy, and so fallible and so very
LINE 381: human--had altogether disappeared.
LINE 382: IV
LINE 383: Words and books may be ambiguous memorials; but who can misinterpret the
LINE 384: visible solidity of bronze and stone? At Frogmore, near Windsor, where
LINE 385: her mother was buried, Victoria constructed, at the cost of L200,000, a
LINE 386: vast and elaborate mausoleum for herself and her husband. But that was
LINE 387: a private and domestic monument, and the Queen desired that wherever
LINE 388: her subjects might be gathered together they should be reminded of the
LINE 389: Prince. Her desire was gratified; all over the country--at Aberdeen, at
LINE 390: Perth, and at Wolverhampton--statues of the Prince were erected; and
LINE 391: the Queen, making an exception to her rule of retirement, unveiled them
LINE 392: herself. Nor did the capital lag behind. A month after the Prince's
LINE 393: death a meeting was called together at the Mansion House to discuss
LINE 394: schemes for honouring his memory. Opinions, however, were divided upon
LINE 395: the subject. Was a statue or an institution to be preferred? Meanwhile a
LINE 396: subscription was opened; an influential committee was appointed, and the
LINE 397: Queen was consulted as to her wishes in the matter. Her Majesty replied
LINE 398: that she would prefer a granite obelisk, with sculptures at the base, to
LINE 399: an institution. But the committee hesitated: an obelisk, to be worthy
LINE 400: of the name, must clearly be a monolith; and where was the quarry in
LINE 401: England capable of furnishing a granite block of the required size? It
LINE 402: was true that there was granite in Russian Finland; but the committee
LINE 403: were advised that it was not adapted to resist exposure to the open air.
LINE 404: On the whole, therefore, they suggested that a Memorial Hall should be
LINE 405: erected, together with a statue of the Prince. Her Majesty assented; but
LINE 406: then another difficulty arose. It was found that not more than L60,000
LINE 407: had been subscribed--a sum insufficient to defray the double expense.
LINE 408: The Hall, therefore, was abandoned; a statue alone was to be erected;
LINE 409: and certain eminent architects were asked to prepare designs. Eventually
LINE 410: the committee had at their disposal a total sum of L120,000, since
LINE 411: the public subscribed another L10,000, while L50,000 was voted by
LINE 412: Parliament. Some years later a joint stock company was formed and built,
LINE 413: as a private speculation, the Albert Hall.
LINE 414: The architect whose design was selected, both by the committee and by
LINE 415: the Queen, was Mr. Gilbert Scott, whose industry, conscientiousness,
LINE 416: and genuine piety had brought him to the head of his profession.
LINE 417: His lifelong zeal for the Gothic style having given him a special
LINE 418: prominence, his handiwork was strikingly visible, not only in a
LINE 419: multitude of original buildings, but in most of the cathedrals of
LINE 420: England. Protests, indeed, were occasionally raised against his
LINE 421: renovations; but Mr. Scott replied with such vigour and unction in
LINE 422: articles and pamphlets that not a Dean was unconvinced, and he was
LINE 423: permitted to continue his labours without interruption. On one occasion,
LINE 424: however, his devotion to Gothic had placed him in an unpleasant
LINE 425: situation. The Government offices in Whitehall were to be rebuilt; Mr.
LINE 426: Scott competed, and his designs were successful. Naturally, they were in
LINE 427: the Gothic style, combining "a certain squareness and horizontality of
LINE 428: outline" with pillar-mullions, gables, high-pitched roofs, and dormers;
LINE 429: and the drawings, as Mr. Scott himself observed, "were, perhaps, the
LINE 430: best ever sent in to a competition, or nearly so." After the usual
LINE 431: difficulties and delays the work was at last to be put in hand, when
LINE 432: there was a change of Government and Lord Palmerston became Prime
LINE 433: Minister. Lord Palmerston at once sent for Mr. Scott. "Well, Mr. Scott,"
LINE 434: he said, in his jaunty way, "I can't have anything to do with this
LINE 435: Gothic style. I must insist on your making a design in the Italian
LINE 436: manner, which I am sure you can do very cleverly." Mr. Scott was
LINE 437: appalled; the style of the Italian renaissance was not only unsightly,
LINE 438: it was positively immoral, and he sternly refused to have anything to do
LINE 439: with it. Thereupon Lord Palmerston assumed a fatherly tone. "Quite true;
LINE 440: a Gothic architect can't be expected to put up a Classical building;
LINE 441: I must find someone else." This was intolerable, and Mr. Scott, on his
LINE 442: return home, addressed to the Prime Minister a strongly-worded letter,
LINE 443: in which he dwelt upon his position as an architect, upon his having won
LINE 444: two European competitions, his being an A.R.A., a gold medallist of the
LINE 445: Institute, and a lecturer on architecture at the Royal Academy; but it
LINE 446: was useless--Lord Palmerston did not even reply. It then occurred to
LINE 447: Mr. Scott that, by a judicious mixture, he might, while preserving the
LINE 448: essential character of the Gothic, produce a design which would give a
LINE 449: superficial impression of the Classical style. He did so, but no effect
LINE 450: was produced upon Lord Palmerston. The new design, he said, was "neither
LINE 451: one thing nor 'tother--a regular mongrel affair--and he would have
LINE 452: nothing to do with it either." After that Mr. Scott found it necessary
LINE 453: to recruit for two months at Scarborough, "with a course of quinine." He
LINE 454: recovered his tone at last, but only at the cost of his convictions. For
LINE 455: the sake of his family he felt that it was his unfortunate duty to obey
LINE 456: the Prime Minister; and, shuddering with horror, he constructed the
LINE 457: Government offices in a strictly Renaissance style.
LINE 458: Shortly afterwards Mr. Scott found some consolation in building the St.
LINE 459: Pancras Hotel in a style of his own.
LINE 460: And now another and yet more satisfactory task was his. "My idea in
LINE 461: designing the Memorial," he wrote, "was to erect a kind of ciborium to
LINE 462: protect a statue of the Prince; and its special characteristic was
LINE 463: that the ciborium was designed in some degree on the principles of the
LINE 464: ancient shrines. These shrines were models of imaginary buildings, such
LINE 465: as had never in reality been erected; and my idea was to realise one of
LINE 466: these imaginary structures with its precious materials, its inlaying,
LINE 467: its enamels, etc. etc." His idea was particularly appropriate since
LINE 468: it chanced that a similar conception, though in the reverse order of
LINE 469: magnitude, had occurred to the Prince himself, who had designed and
LINE 470: executed several silver cruet-stands upon the same model. At the Queen's
LINE 471: request a site was chosen in Kensington Gardens as near as possible
LINE 472: to that of the Great Exhibition; and in May, 1864, the first sod was
LINE 473: turned. The work was long, complicated, and difficult; a great number
LINE 474: of workmen were employed, besides several subsidiary sculptors and
LINE 475: metal--workers under Mr. Scott's direction, while at every stage
LINE 476: sketches and models were submitted to Her Majesty, who criticised all
LINE 477: the details with minute care, and constantly suggested improvements. The
LINE 478: frieze, which encircled the base of the monument, was in itself a very
LINE 479: serious piece of work. "This," said Mr. Scott, "taken as a whole, is
LINE 480: perhaps one of the most laborious works of sculpture ever undertaken,
LINE 481: consisting, as it does, of a continuous range of figure-sculpture of the
LINE 482: most elaborate description, in the highest alto-relievo of life-size, of
LINE 483: more than 200 feet in length, containing about 170 figures, and executed
LINE 484: in the hardest marble which could be procured." After three years of
LINE 485: toil the memorial was still far from completion, and Mr. Scott thought
LINE 486: it advisable to give a dinner to the workmen, "as a substantial
LINE 487: recognition of his appreciation of their skill and energy." "Two long
LINE 488: tables," we are told, "constructed of scaffold planks, were arranged in
LINE 489: the workshops, and covered with newspapers, for want of table-cloths.
LINE 490: Upwards of eighty men sat down. Beef and mutton, plum pudding and cheese
LINE 491: were supplied in abundance, and each man who desired it had three pints
LINE 492: of beer, gingerbeer and lemonade being provided for the teetotalers, who
LINE 493: formed a very considerable proportion... Several toasts were given and
LINE 494: many of the workmen spoke, almost all of them commencing by 'Thanking
LINE 495: God that they enjoyed good health;' some alluded to the temperance that
LINE 496: prevailed amongst them, others observed how little swearing was ever
LINE 497: heard, whilst all said how pleased and proud they were to be engaged on
LINE 498: so great a work."
LINE 499: Gradually the edifice approached completion. The one hundred and
LINE 500: seventieth life-size figure in the frieze was chiselled, the granite
LINE 501: pillars arose, the mosaics were inserted in the allegorical pediments,
LINE 502: the four colossal statues representing the greater Christian virtues,
LINE 503: the four other colossal statues representing the greater moral virtues,
LINE 504: were hoisted into their positions, the eight bronzes representing the
LINE 505: greater sciences--Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology, Geometry, Rhetoric,
LINE 506: Medicine, Philosophy, and Physiology--were fixed on their glittering
LINE 507: pinnacles, high in air. The statue of Physiology was particularly
LINE 508: admired. "On her left arm," the official description informs us, "she
LINE 509: bears a new-born infant, as a representation of the development of the
LINE 510: highest and most perfect of physiological forms; her hand points
LINE 511: towards a microscope, the instrument which lends its assistance for the
LINE 512: investigation of the minuter forms of animal and vegetable organisms."
LINE 513: At last the gilded cross crowned the dwindling galaxies of superimposed
LINE 514: angels, the four continents in white marble stood at the four corners
LINE 515: of the base, and, seven years after its inception, in July, 1872, the
LINE 516: monument was thrown open to the public.
LINE 517: But four more years were to elapse before the central figure was ready
LINE 518: to be placed under its starry canopy. It was designed by Mr. Foley,
LINE 519: though in one particular the sculptor's freedom was restricted by Mr.
LINE 520: Scott. "I have chosen the sitting posture," Mr. Scott said, "as best
LINE 521: conveying the idea of dignity befitting a royal personage." Mr. Foley
LINE 522: ably carried out the conception of his principal. "In the attitude
LINE 523: and expression," he said, "the aim has been, with the individuality of
LINE 524: portraiture, to embody rank, character, and enlightenment, and to convey
LINE 525: a sense of that responsive intelligence indicating an active, rather
LINE 526: than a passive, interest in those pursuits of civilisation illustrated
LINE 527: in the surrounding figures, groups, and relievos... To identify the
LINE 528: figure with one of the most memorable undertakings of the public life
LINE 529: of the Prince--the International Exhibition of 1851--a catalogue of the
LINE 530: works collected in that first gathering of the industry of all nations,
LINE 531: is placed in the right hand." The statue was of bronze gilt and weighed
LINE 532: nearly ten tons. It was rightly supposed that the simple word "Albert,"
LINE 533: cast on the base, would be a sufficient means of identification.
