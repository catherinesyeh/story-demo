LINE 1: I
LINE 2: The new queen was almost entirely unknown to her subjects. In her public
LINE 3: appearances her mother had invariably dominated the scene. Her private
LINE 4: life had been that of a novice in a convent: hardly a human being from
LINE 5: the outside world had ever spoken to her; and no human being at all,
LINE 6: except her mother and the Baroness Lehzen, had ever been alone with
LINE 7: her in a room. Thus it was not only the public at large that was in
LINE 8: ignorance of everything concerning her; the inner circles of statesmen
LINE 9: and officials and high-born ladies were equally in the dark. When she
LINE 10: suddenly emerged from this deep obscurity, the impression that she
LINE 11: created was immediate and profound. Her bearing at her first Council
LINE 12: filled the whole gathering with astonishment and admiration; the Duke of
LINE 13: Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, even the savage Croker, even the cold and
LINE 14: caustic Greville--all were completely carried away. Everything that was
LINE 15: reported of her subsequent proceedings seemed to be of no less happy
LINE 16: augury. Her perceptions were quick, her decisions were sensible, her
LINE 17: language was discreet; she performed her royal duties with extraordinary
LINE 18: facility. Among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm.
LINE 19: Sentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the spectacle of
LINE 20: the little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair and pink cheeks,
LINE 21: driving through her capital, filled the hearts of the beholders with
LINE 22: raptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all, struck everybody
LINE 23: with overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and
LINE 24: her uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and selfish, pig-headed and
LINE 25: ridiculous, with their perpetual burden of debts, confusions, and
LINE 26: disreputabilities--they had vanished like the snows of winter, and here
LINE 27: at last, crowned and radiant, was the spring. Lord John Russell, in an
LINE 28: elaborate oration, gave voice to the general sentiment. He hoped that
LINE 29: Victoria might prove an Elizabeth without her tyranny, an Anne without
LINE 30: her weakness. He asked England to pray that the illustrious Princess who
LINE 31: had just ascended the throne with the purest intentions and the justest
LINE 32: desires might see slavery abolished, crime diminished, and education
LINE 33: improved. He trusted that her people would henceforward derive their
LINE 34: strength, their conduct, and their loyalty from enlightened religious
LINE 35: and moral principles, and that, so fortified, the reign of Victoria
LINE 36: might prove celebrated to posterity and to all the nations of the earth.
LINE 37: Very soon, however, there were signs that the future might turn out to
LINE 38: be not quite so simple and roseate as a delighted public dreamed. The
LINE 39: "illustrious Princess" might perhaps, after all, have something within
LINE 40: her which squared ill with the easy vision of a well-conducted heroine
LINE 41: in an edifying story-book. The purest intentions and the justest
LINE 42: desires? No doubt; but was that all? To those who watched closely, for
LINE 43: instance, there might be something ominous in the curious contour
LINE 44: of that little mouth. When, after her first Council, she crossed the
LINE 45: ante-room and found her mother waiting for her, she said, "And now,
LINE 46: Mamma, am I really and truly Queen?" "You see, my dear, that it is so."
LINE 47: "Then, dear Mamma, I hope you will grant me the first request I make
LINE 48: to you, as Queen. Let me be by myself for an hour." For an hour she
LINE 49: remained in solitude. Then she reappeared, and gave a significant order:
LINE 50: her bed was to be moved out of her mother's room. It was the doom of the
LINE 51: Duchess of Kent. The long years of waiting were over at last; the moment
LINE 52: of a lifetime had come; her daughter was Queen of England; and that very
LINE 53: moment brought her own annihilation. She found herself, absolutely and
LINE 54: irretrievably, shut off from every vestige of influence, of confidence,
LINE 55: of power. She was surrounded, indeed, by all the outward signs of
LINE 56: respect and consideration; but that only made the inward truth of her
LINE 57: position the more intolerable. Through the mingled formalities of Court
LINE 58: etiquette and filial duty, she could never penetrate to Victoria. She
LINE 59: was unable to conceal her disappointment and her rage. "Il n'y a plus
LINE 60: d'avenir pour moi," she exclaimed to Madame de Lieven; "je ne suis plus
LINE 61: rien." For eighteen years, she said, this child had been the sole object
LINE 62: of her existence, of her thoughts, her hopes, and now--no! she would
LINE 63: not be comforted, she had lost everything, she was to the last degree
LINE 64: unhappy. Sailing, so gallantly and so pertinaciously, through the
LINE 65: buffeting storms of life, the stately vessel, with sails still swelling
LINE 66: and pennons flying, had put into harbour at last; to find there
LINE 67: nothing--a land of bleak desolation.
LINE 68: Within a month of the accession, the realities of the new situation
LINE 69: assumed a visible shape. The whole royal household moved from Kensington
LINE 70: to Buckingham Palace, and, in the new abode, the Duchess of Kent was
LINE 71: given a suite of apartments entirely separate from the Queen's. By
LINE 72: Victoria herself the change was welcomed, though, at the moment of
LINE 73: departure, she could afford to be sentimental. "Though I rejoice to go
LINE 74: into B. P. for many reasons," she wrote in her diary, "it is not
LINE 75: without feelings of regret that I shall bid adieu for ever to this my
LINE 76: birthplace, where I have been born and bred, and to which I am really
LINE 77: attached!" Her memory lingered for a moment over visions of the past:
LINE 78: her sister's wedding, pleasant balls and delicious concerts and there
LINE 79: were other recollections. "I have gone through painful and disagreeable
LINE 80: scenes here, 'tis true," she concluded, "but still I am fond of the poor
LINE 81: old palace."
LINE 82: At the same time she took another decided step. She had determined that
LINE 83: she would see no more of Sir John Conroy. She rewarded his past services
LINE 84: with liberality: he was given a baronetcy and a pension of L3000 a
LINE 85: year; he remained a member of the Duchess's household, but his personal
LINE 86: intercourse with the Queen came to an abrupt conclusion.
LINE 87: II
LINE 88: It was clear that these interior changes--whatever else they might
LINE 89: betoken--marked the triumph of one person--the Baroness Lehzen. The
LINE 90: pastor's daughter observed the ruin of her enemies. Discreet and
LINE 91: victorious, she remained in possession of the field. More closely than
LINE 92: ever did she cleave to the side of her mistress, her pupil, and her
LINE 93: friend; and in the recesses of the palace her mysterious figure was at
LINE 94: once invisible and omnipresent. When the Queen's Ministers came in
LINE 95: at one door, the Baroness went out by another; when they retired, she
LINE 96: immediately returned. Nobody knew--nobody ever will know--the precise
LINE 97: extent and the precise nature of her influence. She herself declared
LINE 98: that she never discussed public affairs with the Queen, that she was
LINE 99: concerned with private matters only--with private letters and the
LINE 100: details of private life. Certainly her hand is everywhere discernible in
LINE 101: Victoria's early correspondence. The Journal is written in the style of
LINE 102: a child; the Letters are not so simple; they are the work of a
LINE 103: child, rearranged--with the minimum of alteration, no doubt, and yet
LINE 104: perceptibly--by a governess. And the governess was no fool: narrow,
LINE 105: jealous, provincial, she might be; but she was an acute and vigorous
LINE 106: woman, who had gained by a peculiar insight, a peculiar ascendancy. That
LINE 107: ascendancy she meant to keep. No doubt it was true that technically she
LINE 108: took no part in public business; but the distinction between what is
LINE 109: public and what is private is always a subtle one; and in the case of
LINE 110: a reigning sovereign--as the next few years were to show--it is often
LINE 111: imaginary. Considering all things--the characters of the persons, and
LINE 112: the character of the times--it was something more than a mere matter
LINE 113: of private interest that the bedroom of Baroness Lehzen at Buckingham
LINE 114: Palace should have been next door to the bedroom of the Queen.
LINE 115: But the influence wielded by the Baroness, supreme as it seemed within
LINE 116: its own sphere, was not unlimited; there were other forces at work.
LINE 117: For one thing, the faithful Stockmar had taken up his residence in the
LINE 118: palace. During the twenty years which had elapsed since the death of the
LINE 119: Princess Charlotte, his experiences had been varied and remarkable. The
LINE 120: unknown counsellor of a disappointed princeling had gradually risen to a
LINE 121: position of European importance. His devotion to his master had been not
LINE 122: only whole--hearted but cautious and wise. It was Stockmar's advice
LINE 123: that had kept Prince Leopold in England during the critical years which
LINE 124: followed his wife's death, and had thus secured to him the essential
LINE 125: requisite of a point d'appui in the country of his adoption. It was
LINE 126: Stockmar's discretion which had smoothed over the embarrassments
LINE 127: surrounding the Prince's acceptance and rejection of the Greek crown.
LINE 128: It was Stockmar who had induced the Prince to become the constitutional
LINE 129: Sovereign of Belgium. Above all, it was Stockmar's tact, honesty, and
LINE 130: diplomatic skill which, through a long series of arduous and complicated
LINE 131: negotiations, had led to the guarantee of Belgian neutrality by the
LINE 132: Great Powers. His labours had been rewarded by a German barony and by
LINE 133: the complete confidence of King Leopold. Nor was it only in Brussels
LINE 134: that he was treated with respect and listened to with attention.
LINE 135: The statesmen who governed England--Lord Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Lord
LINE 136: Palmerston, Lord Melbourne--had learnt to put a high value upon his
LINE 137: probity and his intelligence. "He is one of the cleverest fellows I
LINE 138: ever saw," said Lord Melbourne, "the most discreet man, the most
LINE 139: well-judging, and most cool man." And Lord Palmerston cited Baron
LINE 140: Stockmar as the only absolutely disinterested man he had come across in
LINE 141: life, At last he was able to retire to Coburg, and to enjoy for a few
LINE 142: years the society of the wife and children whom his labours in the
LINE 143: service of his master had hitherto only allowed him to visit at long
LINE 144: intervals for a month or two at a time. But in 1836 he had been again
LINE 145: entrusted with an important negotiation, which he had brought to
LINE 146: a successful conclusion in the marriage of Prince Ferdinand of
LINE 147: Saxe-Coburg, a nephew of King Leopold's, with Queen Maria II of
LINE 148: Portugal. The House of Coburg was beginning to spread over Europe; and
LINE 149: the establishment of the Baron at Buckingham Palace in 1837 was to be
LINE 150: the prelude of another and a more momentous advance.
LINE 151: King Leopold and his counsellor provide in their careers an example
LINE 152: of the curious diversity of human ambitions. The desires of man are
LINE 153: wonderfully various; but no less various are the means by which those
LINE 154: desires may reach satisfaction: and so the work of the world gets done.
LINE 155: The correct mind of Leopold craved for the whole apparatus of royalty.
LINE 156: Mere power would have held no attractions for him; he must be an actual
LINE 157: king--the crowned head of a people. It was not enough to do; it was
LINE 158: essential also to be recognised; anything else would not be fitting.
LINE 159: The greatness that he dreamt of was surrounded by every appropriate
LINE 160: circumstance. To be a Majesty, to be a cousin of Sovereigns, to marry a
LINE 161: Bourbon for diplomatic ends, to correspond with the Queen of England,
LINE 162: to be very stiff and very punctual, to found a dynasty, to bore
LINE 163: ambassadresses into fits, to live, on the highest pinnacle, an exemplary
LINE 164: life devoted to the public service--such were his objects, and such,
LINE 165: in fact, were his achievements. The "Marquis Peu-a-peu," as George IV
LINE 166: called him, had what he wanted. But this would never have been the case
LINE 167: if it had not happened that the ambition of Stockmar took a form exactly
LINE 168: complementary to his own. The sovereignty that the Baron sought for
LINE 169: was by no means obvious. The satisfaction of his essential being lay
LINE 170: in obscurity, in invisibility--in passing, unobserved, through a hidden
LINE 171: entrance, into the very central chamber of power, and in sitting there,
LINE 172: quietly, pulling the subtle strings that set the wheels of the
LINE 173: whole world in motion. A very few people, in very high places, and
LINE 174: exceptionally well-informed, knew that Baron Stockmar was a most
LINE 175: important person: that was enough. The fortunes of the master and the
LINE 176: servant, intimately interacting, rose together. The Baron's secret skill
LINE 177: had given Leopold his unexceptionable kingdom; and Leopold, in his turn,
LINE 178: as time went on, was able to furnish the Baron with more and more keys
LINE 179: to more and more back doors.
LINE 180: Stockmar took up his abode in the Palace partly as the emissary of King
LINE 181: Leopold, but more particularly as the friend and adviser of a queen who
LINE 182: was almost a child, and who, no doubt, would be much in need of advice
LINE 183: and friendship. For it would be a mistake to suppose that either of
LINE 184: these two men was actuated by a vulgar selfishness. The King, indeed,
LINE 185: was very well aware on which side his bread was buttered; during an
LINE 186: adventurous and chequered life he had acquired a shrewd knowledge of
LINE 187: the world's workings; and he was ready enough to use that knowledge
LINE 188: to strengthen his position and to spread his influence. But then, the
LINE 189: firmer his position and the wider his influence, the better for Europe;
LINE 190: of that he was quite certain. And besides, he was a constitutional
LINE 191: monarch; and it would be highly indecorous in a constitutional monarch
LINE 192: to have any aims that were low or personal.
LINE 193: As for Stockmar, the disinterestedness which Palmerston had noted was
LINE 194: undoubtedly a basic element in his character. The ordinary schemer is
LINE 195: always an optimist; and Stockmar, racked by dyspepsia and haunted by
LINE 196: gloomy forebodings, was a constitutionally melancholy man. A schemer, no
LINE 197: doubt, he was; but he schemed distrustfully, splenetically, to do good.
LINE 198: To do good! What nobler end could a man scheme for? Yet it is perilous
LINE 199: to scheme at all.
LINE 200: With Lehzen to supervise every detail of her conduct, with Stockmar in
LINE 201: the next room, so full of wisdom and experience of affairs, with her
LINE 202: Uncle Leopold's letters, too, pouring out so constantly their stream of
LINE 203: encouragements, general reflections, and highly valuable tips, Victoria,
LINE 204: even had she been without other guidance, would have stood in no lack of
LINE 205: private counsellor. But other guidance she had; for all these influences
LINE 206: paled before a new star, of the first magnitude, which, rising suddenly
LINE 207: upon her horizon, immediately dominated her life.
LINE 208: III
LINE 209: William Lamb, Viscount Melbourne, was fifty-eight years of age, and
LINE 210: had been for the last three years Prime Minister of England. In every
LINE 211: outward respect he was one of the most fortunate of mankind. He had
LINE 212: been born into the midst of riches, brilliance, and power. His mother,
LINE 213: fascinating and intelligent, had been a great Whig hostess, and he had
LINE 214: been bred up as a member of that radiant society which, during the
LINE 215: last quarter of the eighteenth century, concentrated within itself
LINE 216: the ultimate perfections of a hundred years of triumphant aristocracy.
LINE 217: Nature had given him beauty and brains; the unexpected death of an
LINE 218: elder brother brought him wealth, a peerage, and the possibility of
LINE 219: high advancement. Within that charmed circle, whatever one's personal
LINE 220: disabilities, it was difficult to fail; and to him, with all his
LINE 221: advantages, success was well-nigh unavoidable. With little effort, he
LINE 222: attained political eminence. On the triumph of the Whigs he became one
LINE 223: of the leading members of the Government; and when Lord Grey retired
LINE 224: from the premiership he quietly stepped into the vacant place. Nor was
LINE 225: it only in the visible signs of fortune that Fate had been kind to him.
LINE 226: Bound to succeed, and to succeed easily, he was gifted with so fine
LINE 227: a nature that his success became him. His mind, at once supple and
LINE 228: copious, his temperament, at once calm and sensitive, enabled him not
LINE 229: merely to work, but to live with perfect facility and with the grace of
LINE 230: strength. In society he was a notable talker, a captivating companion,
LINE 231: a charming man. If one looked deeper, one saw at once that he was not
LINE 232: ordinary, that the piquancies of his conversation and his manner--his
LINE 233: free-and-easy vaguenesses, his abrupt questions, his lollings and
LINE 234: loungings, his innumerable oaths--were something more than an amusing
LINE 235: ornament, were the outward manifestation of an individuality that was
LINE 236: fundamental.
LINE 237: The precise nature of this individuality was very difficult to gauge: it
LINE 238: was dubious, complex, perhaps self--contradictory. Certainly there was
LINE 239: an ironical discordance between the inner history of the man and his
LINE 240: apparent fortunes. He owed all he had to his birth, and his birth was
LINE 241: shameful; it was known well enough that his mother had passionately
LINE 242: loved Lord Egremont, and that Lord Melbourne was not his father. His
LINE 243: marriage, which had seemed to be the crown of his youthful ardours,
LINE 244: was a long, miserable, desperate failure: the incredible Lady Caroline,
LINE 245: "With pleasures too refined to please, With too much spirit to be
LINE 246: e'er at ease, With too much quickness to be ever taught, With too much
LINE 247: thinking to have common thought," was very nearly the destruction of
LINE 248: his life. When at last he emerged from the anguish and confusion of her
LINE 249: folly, her extravagance, her rage, her despair, and her devotion, he was
LINE 250: left alone with endless memories of intermingled farce and tragedy, and
LINE 251: an only son, who was an imbecile. But there was something else that he
LINE 252: owed to Lady Caroline. While she whirled with Byron in a hectic frenzy
LINE 253: of love and fashion, he had stayed at home in an indulgence bordering
LINE 254: on cynicism, and occupied his solitude with reading. It was thus that he
LINE 255: had acquired those habits of study, that love of learning, and that wide
LINE 256: and accurate knowledge of ancient and modern literature, which formed so
LINE 257: unexpected a part of his mental equipment. His passion for reading never
LINE 258: deserted him; even when he was Prime Minister he found time to
LINE 259: master every new important book. With an incongruousness that was
LINE 260: characteristic, his favourite study was theology. An accomplished
LINE 261: classical scholar, he was deeply read in the Fathers of the Church;
LINE 262: heavy volumes of commentary and exegesis he examined with scrupulous
LINE 263: diligence; and at any odd moment he might be found turning over the
LINE 264: pages of the Bible. To the ladies whom he most liked, he would lend some
LINE 265: learned work on the Revelation, crammed with marginal notes in his own
LINE 266: hand, or Dr. Lardner's "Observations upon the Jewish Errors with respect
LINE 267: to the Conversion of Mary Magdalene." The more pious among them had high
LINE 268: hopes that these studies would lead him into the right way; but of this
LINE 269: there were no symptoms in his after-dinner conversations.
LINE 270: The paradox of his political career was no less curious. By temperament
LINE 271: an aristocrat, by conviction a conservative, he came to power as the
LINE 272: leader of the popular party, the party of change. He had profoundly
LINE 273: disliked the Reform Bill, which he had only accepted at last as
LINE 274: a necessary evil; and the Reform Bill lay at the root of the very
LINE 275: existence, of the very meaning, of his government. He was far too
LINE 276: sceptical to believe in progress of any kind. Things were best as they
LINE 277: were or rather, they were least bad. "You'd better try to do no good,"
LINE 278: was one of his dictums, "and then you'll get into no scrapes." Education
LINE 279: at best was futile; education of the poor was positively dangerous. The
LINE 280: factory children? "Oh, if you'd only have the goodness to leave them
LINE 281: alone!" Free Trade was a delusion; the ballot was nonsense; and there
LINE 282: was no such thing as a democracy.
LINE 283: Nevertheless, he was not a reactionary; he was simply an opportunist.
LINE 284: The whole duty of government, he said, was "to prevent crime and to
LINE 285: preserve contracts." All one could really hope to do was to carry on. He
LINE 286: himself carried on in a remarkable manner--with perpetual compromises,
LINE 287: with fluctuations and contradictions, with every kind of weakness, and
LINE 288: yet with shrewdness, with gentleness, even with conscientiousness, and
LINE 289: a light and airy mastery of men and of events. He conducted the
LINE 290: transactions of business with extraordinary nonchalance. Important
LINE 291: persons, ushered up for some grave interview, found him in a
LINE 292: towselled bed, littered with books and papers, or vaguely shaving in a
LINE 293: dressing-room; but, when they went downstairs again, they would realise
LINE 294: that somehow or other they had been pumped. When he had to receive a
LINE 295: deputation, he could hardly ever do so with becoming gravity. The worthy
LINE 296: delegates of the tallow-chandlers, or the Society for the Abolition of
LINE 297: Capital Punishment, were distressed and mortified when, in the midst of
LINE 298: their speeches, the Prime Minister became absorbed in blowing a feather,
LINE 299: or suddenly cracked an unseemly joke. How could they have guessed that
LINE 300: he had spent the night before diligently getting up the details of their
LINE 301: case? He hated patronage and the making of appointments--a feeling rare
LINE 302: in Ministers. "As for the Bishops," he burst out, "I positively believe
LINE 303: they die to vex me." But when at last the appointment was made, it
LINE 304: was made with keen discrimination. His colleagues observed another
LINE 305: symptom--was it of his irresponsibility or his wisdom? He went to sleep
LINE 306: in the Cabinet.
LINE 307: Probably, if he had been born a little earlier, he would have been a
LINE 308: simpler and a happier man. As it was, he was a child of the eighteenth
LINE 309: century whose lot was cast in a new, difficult, unsympathetic age.
LINE 310: He was an autumn rose. With all his gracious amenity, his humour, his
LINE 311: happy-go-lucky ways, a deep disquietude possessed him. A sentimental
LINE 312: cynic, a sceptical believer, he was restless and melancholy at heart.
LINE 313: Above all, he could never harden himself; those sensitive petals
LINE 314: shivered in every wind. Whatever else he might be, one thing was
LINE 315: certain: Lord Melbourne was always human, supremely human--too human,
LINE 316: perhaps.
LINE 317: And now, with old age upon him, his life took a sudden, new,
LINE 318: extraordinary turn. He became, in the twinkling of an eye, the intimate
LINE 319: adviser and the daily companion of a young girl who had stepped all at
LINE 320: once from a nursery to a throne. His relations with women had been, like
LINE 321: everything else about him, ambiguous. Nobody had ever been able quite
LINE 322: to gauge the shifting, emotional complexities of his married life; Lady
LINE 323: Caroline vanished; but his peculiar susceptibilities remained. Female
LINE 324: society of some kind or other was necessary to him, and he did not
LINE 325: stint himself; a great part of every day was invariably spent in it. The
LINE 326: feminine element in him made it easy, made it natural and inevitable for
LINE 327: him to be the friend of a great many women; but the masculine element
LINE 328: in him was strong as well. In such circumstances it is also easy, it is
LINE 329: even natural, perhaps it is even inevitable, to be something more than
LINE 330: a friend. There were rumours and combustions. Lord Melbourne was twice a
LINE 331: co-respondent in a divorce action; but on each occasion he won his suit.
LINE 332: The lovely Lady Brandon, the unhappy and brilliant Mrs. Norton... the
LINE 333: law exonerated them both. Beyond that hung an impenetrable veil. But
LINE 334: at any rate it was clear that, with such a record, the Prime Minister's
LINE 335: position in Buckingham Palace must be a highly delicate one. However,
LINE 336: he was used to delicacies, and he met the situation with consummate
LINE 337: success. His behaviour was from the first moment impeccable. His manner
LINE 338: towards the young Queen mingled, with perfect facility, the watchfulness
LINE 339: and the respect of a statesman and a courtier with the tender solicitude
LINE 340: of a parent. He was at once reverential and affectionate, at once the
LINE 341: servant and the guide. At the same time the habits of his life underwent
LINE 342: a surprising change. His comfortable, unpunctual days became subject to
LINE 343: the unaltering routine of a palace; no longer did he sprawl on sofas;
LINE 344: not a single "damn" escaped his lips. The man of the world who had been
LINE 345: the friend of Byron and the regent, the talker whose paradoxes had held
LINE 346: Holland House enthralled, the cynic whose ribaldries had enlivened so
LINE 347: many deep potations, the lover whose soft words had captivated such
LINE 348: beauty and such passion and such wit, might now be seen, evening after
LINE 349: evening, talking with infinite politeness to a schoolgirl, bolt upright,
LINE 350: amid the silence and the rigidity of Court etiquette.
LINE 351: IV
LINE 352: On her side, Victoria was instantaneously fascinated by Lord Melbourne.
LINE 353: The good report of Stockmar had no doubt prepared the way; Lehzen was
LINE 354: wisely propitiated; and the first highly favourable impression was never
LINE 355: afterwards belied. She found him perfect; and perfect in her sight he
LINE 356: remained. Her absolute and unconcealed adoration was very natural; what
LINE 357: innocent young creature could have resisted, in any circumstances, the
LINE 358: charm and the devotion of such a man? But, in her situation, there was
LINE 359: a special influence which gave a peculiar glow to all she felt. After
LINE 360: years of emptiness and dullness and suppression, she had come suddenly,
LINE 361: in the heyday of youth, into freedom and power. She was mistress
LINE 362: of herself, of great domains and palaces; she was Queen of England.
LINE 363: Responsibilities and difficulties she might have, no doubt, and in heavy
LINE 364: measure; but one feeling dominated and absorbed all others--the feeling
LINE 365: of joy. Everything pleased her. She was in high spirits from morning
LINE 366: till night. Mr. Creevey, grown old now, and very near his end, catching
LINE 367: a glimpse of her at Brighton, was much amused, in his sharp fashion, by
LINE 368: the ingenuous gaiety of "little Vic." "A more homely little being you
LINE 369: never beheld, when she is at her ease, and she is evidently dying to be
LINE 370: always more so. She laughs in real earnest, opening her mouth as wide as
LINE 371: it can go, showing not very pretty gums... She eats quite as heartily
LINE 372: as she laughs, I think I may say she gobbles... She blushes and laughs
LINE 373: every instant in so natural a way as to disarm anybody." But it was not
LINE 374: merely when she was laughing or gobbling that she enjoyed herself; the
LINE 375: performance of her official duties gave her intense satisfaction. "I
LINE 376: really have immensely to do," she wrote in her Journal a few days after
LINE 377: her accession; "I receive so many communications from my Ministers, but
LINE 378: I like it very much." And again, a week later, "I repeat what I said
LINE 379: before that I have so many communications from the Ministers, and from
LINE 380: me to them, and I get so many papers to sign every day, that I have
LINE 381: always a very great deal to do. I delight in this work." Through the
LINE 382: girl's immaturity the vigorous predestined tastes of the woman were
LINE 383: pushing themselves into existence with eager velocity, with delicious
LINE 384: force.
LINE 385: One detail of her happy situation deserves particular mention. Apart
LINE 386: from the splendour of her social position and the momentousness of her
LINE 387: political one, she was a person of great wealth. As soon as Parliament
LINE 388: met, an annuity of L385,000 was settled upon her. When the expenses of
LINE 389: her household had been discharged, she was left with L68,000 a year of
LINE 390: her own. She enjoyed besides the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster,
LINE 391: which amounted annually to over L27,000. The first use to which she put
LINE 392: her money was characteristic: she paid off her father's debts. In
LINE 393: money matters, no less than in other matters, she was determined to be
LINE 394: correct. She had the instincts of a man of business; and she never could
LINE 395: have borne to be in a position that was financially unsound.
LINE 396: With youth and happiness gilding every hour, the days passed merrily
LINE 397: enough. And each day hinged upon Lord Melbourne. Her diary shows us,
LINE 398: with undiminished clarity, the life of the young sovereign during
LINE 399: the early months of her reign--a life satisfactorily regular, full
LINE 400: of delightful business, a life of simple pleasures, mostly
LINE 401: physical--riding, eating, dancing--a quick, easy, highly unsophisticated
LINE 402: life, sufficient unto itself. The light of the morning is upon it; and,
LINE 403: in the rosy radiance, the figure of "Lord M." emerges, glorified and
LINE 404: supreme. If she is the heroine of the story, he is the hero; but indeed
LINE 405: they are more than hero and heroine, for there are no other characters
LINE 406: at all. Lehzen, the Baron, Uncle Leopold, are unsubstantial shadows--the
LINE 407: incidental supers of the piece. Her paradise was peopled by two persons,
LINE 408: and surely that was enough. One sees them together still, a curious
LINE 409: couple, strangely united in those artless pages, under the magical
LINE 410: illumination of that dawn of eighty years ago: the polished high fine
LINE 411: gentleman with the whitening hair and whiskers and the thick dark
LINE 412: eyebrows and the mobile lips and the big expressive eyes; and beside him
LINE 413: the tiny Queen--fair, slim, elegant, active, in her plain girl's dress
LINE 414: and little tippet, looking up at him earnestly, adoringly, with eyes
LINE 415: blue and projecting, and half-open mouth. So they appear upon every page
LINE 416: of the Journal; upon every page Lord M. is present, Lord M. is speaking,
LINE 417: Lord M. is being amusing, instructive, delightful, and affectionate at
LINE 418: once, while Victoria drinks in the honied words, laughs till she shows
LINE 419: her gums, tries hard to remember, and runs off, as soon as she is left
LINE 420: alone, to put it all down. Their long conversations touched upon a
LINE 421: multitude of topics. Lord M. would criticise books, throw out a remark
LINE 422: or two on the British Constitution, make some passing reflections
LINE 423: on human life, and tell story after story of the great people of the
LINE 424: eighteenth century. Then there would be business a despatch perhaps
LINE 425: from Lord Durham in Canada, which Lord M. would read. But first he
LINE 426: must explain a little. "He said that I must know that Canada originally
LINE 427: belonged to the French, and was only ceded to the English in 1760, when
LINE 428: it was taken in an expedition under Wolfe: 'a very daring enterprise,'
LINE 429: he said. Canada was then entirely French, and the British only came
LINE 430: afterwards... Lord M. explained this very clearly (and much better
LINE 431: than I have done) and said a good deal more about it. He then read me
LINE 432: Durham's despatch, which is a very long one and took him more than 1/2
LINE 433: an hour to read. Lord M. read it beautifully with that fine soft voice
LINE 434: of his, and with so much expression, so that it is needless to say I
LINE 435: was much interested by it." And then the talk would take a more personal
LINE 436: turn. Lord M. would describe his boyhood, and she would learn that "he
LINE 437: wore his hair long, as all boys then did, till he was 17; (how handsome
LINE 438: he must have looked!)." Or she would find out about his queer tastes and
LINE 439: habits--how he never carried a watch, which seemed quite extraordinary.
LINE 440: "'I always ask the servant what o'clock it is, and then he tells me what
LINE 441: he likes,' said Lord M." Or, as the rooks wheeled about round the trees,
LINE 442: "in a manner which indicated rain," he would say that he could sit
LINE 443: looking at them for an hour, and "was quite surprised at my disliking
LINE 444: them. M. said, 'The rooks are my delight.'"
LINE 445: The day's routine, whether in London or at Windsor, was almost
LINE 446: invariable. The morning was devoted to business and Lord M. In the
LINE 447: afternoon the whole Court went out riding. The Queen, in her velvet
LINE 448: riding--habit and a top-hat with a veil draped about the brim, headed
LINE 449: the cavalcade; and Lord M. rode beside her. The lively troupe went fast
LINE 450: and far, to the extreme exhilaration of Her Majesty. Back in the Palace
LINE 451: again, there was still time for a little more fun before dinner--a game
LINE 452: of battledore and shuttlecock perhaps, or a romp along the galleries
LINE 453: with some children. Dinner came, and the ceremonial decidedly tightened.
LINE 454: The gentleman of highest rank sat on the right hand of the Queen; on her
LINE 455: left--it soon became an established rule--sat Lord Melbourne. After the
LINE 456: ladies had left the dining-room, the gentlemen were not permitted to
LINE 457: remain behind for very long; indeed, the short time allowed them for
LINE 458: their wine-drinking formed the subject--so it was rumoured--of one of
LINE 459: the very few disputes between the Queen and her Prime Minister;(*) but
LINE 460: her determination carried the day, and from that moment after-dinner
LINE 461: drunkenness began to go out of fashion. When the company was reassembled
LINE 462: in the drawing-room the etiquette was stiff. For a few moments the Queen
LINE 463: spoke in turn to each one of her guests; and during these short uneasy
LINE 464: colloquies the aridity of royalty was apt to become painfully evident.
LINE 465: One night Mr. Greville, the Clerk of the Privy Council, was present; his
LINE 466: turn soon came; the middle-aged, hard-faced viveur was addressed by his
LINE 467: young hostess. "Have you been riding to-day, Mr. Greville?" asked the
LINE 468: Queen. "No, Madam, I have not," replied Mr. Greville. "It was a fine
LINE 469: day," continued the Queen. "Yes, Madam, a very fine day," said Mr.
LINE 470: Greville. "It was rather cold, though," said the Queen. "It was rather
LINE 471: cold, Madam," said Mr. Greville. "Your sister, Lady Frances Egerton,
LINE 472: rides, I think, doesn't she?" said the Queen. "She does ride sometimes,
LINE 473: Madam," said Mr. Greville. There was a pause, after which Mr. Greville
LINE 474: ventured to take the lead, though he did not venture to change the
LINE 475: subject. "Has your Majesty been riding today?" asked Mr. Greville. "Oh
LINE 476: yes, a very long ride," answered the Queen with animation. "Has your
LINE 477: Majesty got a nice horse?" said Mr. Greville. "Oh, a very nice horse,"
LINE 478: said the Queen. It was over. Her Majesty gave a smile and an inclination
LINE 479: of the head, Mr. Greville a profound bow, and the next conversation
LINE 480: began with the next gentleman. When all the guests had been disposed
LINE 481: of, the Duchess of Kent sat down to her whist, while everybody else was
LINE 482: ranged about the round table. Lord Melbourne sat beside the Queen, and
LINE 483: talked pertinaciously--very often a propos to the contents of one of the
LINE 484: large albums of engravings with which the round table was covered--until
LINE 485: it was half-past eleven and time to go to bed.
LINE 486: (*) The Duke of Bedford told Greville he was "sure there was
LINE 487: a battle between her and Melbourne... He is sure there was
LINE 488: one about the men's sitting after dinner, for he heard her
LINE 489: say to him rather angrily, 'it is a horrid custom-' but when
LINE 490: the ladies left the room (he dined there) directions were
LINE 491: given that the men should remain five minutes longer."
LINE 492: Greville Memoirs, February 26, 1840 (unpublished).
LINE 493: Occasionally, there were little diversions: the evening might be spent
LINE 494: at the opera or at the play. Next morning the royal critic was careful
LINE 495: to note down her impressions. "It was Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet,
LINE 496: and we came in at the beginning of it. Mr. Charles Kean (son of
LINE 497: old Kean) acted the part of Hamlet, and I must say beautifully.
LINE 498: His conception of this very difficult, and I may almost say
LINE 499: incomprehensible, character is admirable; his delivery of all the fine
LINE 500: long speeches quite beautiful; he is excessively graceful and all
LINE 501: his actions and attitudes are good, though not at all good-looking in
LINE 502: face... I came away just as Hamlet was over." Later on, she went to see
LINE 503: Macready in King Lear. The story was new to her; she knew nothing about
LINE 504: it, and at first she took very little interest in what was passing on
LINE 505: the stage; she preferred to chatter and laugh with the Lord Chamberlain.
LINE 506: But, as the play went on, her mood changed; her attention was fixed, and
LINE 507: then she laughed no more. Yet she was puzzled; it seemed a strange, a
LINE 508: horrible business. What did Lord M. think? Lord M. thought it was a
LINE 509: very fine play, but to be sure, "a rough, coarse play, written for
LINE 510: those times, with exaggerated characters." "I'm glad you've seen it," he
LINE 511: added. But, undoubtedly, the evenings which she enjoyed most were those
LINE 512: on which there was dancing. She was always ready enough to seize
LINE 513: any excuse--the arrival of cousins--a birthday--a gathering of young
LINE 514: people--to give the command for that. Then, when the band played, and
LINE 515: the figures of the dancers swayed to the music, and she felt her own
LINE 516: figure swaying too, with youthful spirits so close on every side--then
LINE 517: her happiness reached its height, her eyes sparkled, she must go on and
LINE 518: on into the small hours of the morning. For a moment Lord M. himself was
LINE 519: forgotten.
LINE 520: V
LINE 521: The months flew past. The summer was over: "the pleasantest summer I
LINE 522: EVER passed in MY LIFE, and I shall never forget this first summer of
LINE 523: my reign." With surprising rapidity, another summer was upon her. The
LINE 524: coronation came and went--a curious dream. The antique, intricate,
LINE 525: endless ceremonial worked itself out as best it could, like some machine
LINE 526: of gigantic complexity which was a little out of order. The small
LINE 527: central figure went through her gyrations. She sat; she walked; she
LINE 528: prayed; she carried about an orb that was almost too heavy to hold; the
LINE 529: Archbishop of Canterbury came and crushed a ring upon the wrong finger,
LINE 530: so that she was ready to cry out with the pain; old Lord Rolle tripped
LINE 531: up in his mantle and fell down the steps as he was doing homage; she
LINE 532: was taken into a side chapel, where the altar was covered with a
LINE 533: table-cloth, sandwiches, and bottles of wine; she perceived Lehzen in an
LINE 534: upper box and exchanged a smile with her as she sat, robed and crowned,
LINE 535: on the Confessor's throne. "I shall ever remember this day as the
LINE 536: PROUDEST of my life," she noted. But the pride was soon merged once more
LINE 537: in youth and simplicity. When she returned to Buckingham Palace at
LINE 538: last she was not tired; she ran up to her private rooms, doffed her
LINE 539: splendours, and gave her dog Dash its evening bath.
LINE 540: Life flowed on again with its accustomed smoothness--though, of course,
LINE 541: the smoothness was occasionally disturbed. For one thing, there was the
LINE 542: distressing behaviour of Uncle Leopold. The King of the Belgians had
LINE 543: not been able to resist attempting to make use of his family position
LINE 544: to further his diplomatic ends. But, indeed, why should there be any
LINE 545: question of resisting? Was not such a course of conduct, far from being
LINE 546: a temptation, simply "selon les regles?" What were royal marriages
LINE 547: for, if they did not enable sovereigns, in spite of the hindrances of
LINE 548: constitutions, to control foreign politics? For the highest purposes,
LINE 549: of course; that was understood. The Queen of England was his niece--more
LINE 550: than that--almost his daughter; his confidential agent was living, in
LINE 551: a position of intimate favour, at her court. Surely, in such
LINE 552: circumstances, it would be preposterous, it would be positively
LINE 553: incorrect, to lose the opportunity of bending to his wishes by means
LINE 554: of personal influence, behind the backs of the English Ministers, the
LINE 555: foreign policy of England.
LINE 556: He set about the task with becoming precautions. He continued in his
LINE 557: letters his admirable advice. Within a few days of her accession, he
LINE 558: recommended the young Queen to lay emphasis, on every possible occasion,
LINE 559: upon her English birth; to praise the English nation; "the Established
LINE 560: Church I also recommend strongly; you cannot, without PLEDGING yourself
LINE 561: to anything PARTICULAR, SAY TOO MUCH ON THE SUBJECT." And then "before
LINE 562: you decide on anything important I should be glad if you would consult
LINE 563: me; this would also have the advantage of giving you time;" nothing was
LINE 564: more injurious than to be hurried into wrong decisions unawares. His
LINE 565: niece replied at once with all the accustomed warmth of her affection;
LINE 566: but she wrote hurriedly--and, perhaps, a trifle vaguely too. "YOUR
LINE 567: advice is always of the GREATEST IMPORTANCE to me," she said.
LINE 568: Had he, possibly, gone too far? He could not be certain; perhaps
LINE 569: Victoria HAD been hurried. In any case, he would be careful; he would
LINE 570: draw back--"pour mieux sauter" he added to himself with a smile. In his
LINE 571: next letters he made no reference to his suggestion of consultations
LINE 572: with himself; he merely pointed out the wisdom, in general, of refusing
LINE 573: to decide upon important questions off-hand. So far, his advice was
LINE 574: taken; and it was noticed that the Queen, when applications were made to
LINE 575: her, rarely gave an immediate answer. Even with Lord Melbourne, it was
LINE 576: the same; when he asked for her opinion upon any subject, she would
LINE 577: reply that she would think it over, and tell him her conclusions next
LINE 578: day.
LINE 579: King Leopold's counsels continued. The Princess de Lieven, he said,
LINE 580: was a dangerous woman; there was reason to think that she would make
LINE 581: attempts to pry into what did not concern her, let Victoria beware. "A
LINE 582: rule which I cannot sufficiently recommend is NEVER TO PERMIT people
LINE 583: to speak on subjects concerning yourself or your affairs, without you
LINE 584: having yourself desired them to do so." Should such a thing occur,
LINE 585: "change the conversation, and make the individual feel that he has made
LINE 586: a mistake." This piece of advice was also taken; for it fell out as the
LINE 587: King had predicted. Madame de Lieven sought an audience, and appeared
LINE 588: to be verging towards confidential topics; whereupon the Queen, becoming
LINE 589: slightly embarrassed, talked of nothing but commonplaces. The individual
LINE 590: felt that she had made a mistake.
LINE 591: The King's next warning was remarkable. Letters, he pointed out, are
LINE 592: almost invariably read in the post. This was inconvenient, no doubt; but
LINE 593: the fact, once properly grasped, was not without its advantages. "I will
LINE 594: give you an example: we are still plagued by Prussia concerning those
LINE 595: fortresses; now to tell the Prussian Government many things, which we
LINE 596: SHOULD NOT LIKE to tell them officially, the Minister is going to write
LINE 597: a despatch to our man at Berlin, sending it BY POST; the Prussians ARE
LINE 598: SURE to read it, and to learn in this way what we wish them to hear.
LINE 599: Analogous circumstances might very probably occur in England. I tell you
LINE 600: the TRICK," wrote His Majesty, "that you should be able to guard against
LINE 601: it." Such were the subtleties of constitutional sovereignty.
LINE 602: It seemed that the time had come for another step. The King's next
LINE 603: letter was full of foreign politics--the situation in Spain and
LINE 604: Portugal, the character of Louis Philippe; and he received a favourable
LINE 605: answer. Victoria, it is true, began by saying that she had shown the
LINE 606: POLITICAL PART of his letter to Lord Melbourne; but she proceeded to a
LINE 607: discussion of foreign affairs. It appeared that she was not unwilling
LINE 608: to exchange observations on such matters with her uncle. So far so good.
LINE 609: But King Leopold was still cautious; though a crisis was impending
LINE 610: in his diplomacy, he still hung back; at last, however, he could keep
LINE 611: silence no longer. It was of the utmost importance to him that, in his
LINE 612: manoeuvrings with France and Holland, he should have, or at any rate
LINE 613: appear to have, English support. But the English Government appeared to
LINE 614: adopt a neutral attitude; it was too bad; not to be for him was to
LINE 615: be against him, could they not see that? Yet, perhaps, they were only
LINE 616: wavering, and a little pressure upon them from Victoria might still
LINE 617: save all. He determined to put the case before her, delicately yet
LINE 618: forcibly--just as he saw it himself. "All I want from your kind
LINE 619: Majesty," he wrote, "is, that you will OCCASIONALLY express to your
LINE 620: Ministers, and particularly to good Lord Melbourne, that, as far as it
LINE 621: is COMPATIBLE with the interests of your own dominions, you do NOT wish
LINE 622: that your Government should take the lead in such measures as might in a
LINE 623: short time bring on the DESTRUCTION of this country, as well as that of
LINE 624: your uncle and his family." The result of this appeal was unexpected;
LINE 625: there was dead silence for more than a week. When Victoria at last
LINE 626: wrote, she was prodigal of her affection. "It would, indeed, my dearest
LINE 627: Uncle, be VERY WRONG of you, if you thought my feelings of warm and
LINE 628: devoted attachment to you, and of great affection for you, could be
LINE 629: changed--nothing can ever change them"--but her references to foreign
LINE 630: politics, though they were lengthy and elaborate, were non-committal in
LINE 631: the extreme; they were almost cast in an official and diplomatic form.
LINE 632: Her Ministers, she said, entirely shared her views upon the subject; she
LINE 633: understood and sympathised with the difficulties of her beloved uncle's
LINE 634: position; and he might rest assured "that both Lord Melbourne and Lord
LINE 635: Palmerston are most anxious at all times for the prosperity and welfare
LINE 636: of Belgium." That was all. The King in his reply declared himself
LINE 637: delighted, and re-echoed the affectionate protestations of his niece.
LINE 638: "My dearest and most beloved Victoria," he said, "you have written me
LINE 639: a VERY DEAR and long letter, which has given me GREAT PLEASURE AND
LINE 640: SATISFACTION." He would not admit that he had had a rebuff.
LINE 641: A few months later the crisis came. King Leopold determined to make a
LINE 642: bold push, and to carry Victoria with him, this time, by a display of
LINE 643: royal vigour and avuncular authority. In an abrupt, an almost peremptory
LINE 644: letter, he laid his case, once more, before his niece. "You know from
LINE 645: experience," he wrote, "that I NEVER ASK ANYTHING OF YOU... But, as I
LINE 646: said before, if we are not careful we may see serious consequences which
LINE 647: may affect more or less everybody, and THIS ought to be the object
LINE 648: of our most anxious attention. I remain, my dear Victoria, your
LINE 649: affectionate uncle, Leopold R." The Queen immediately despatched this
LINE 650: letter to Lord Melbourne, who replied with a carefully thought-out form
LINE 651: of words, signifying nothing whatever, which, he suggested, she should
LINE 652: send to her uncle. She did so, copying out the elaborate formula, with a
LINE 653: liberal scattering of "dear Uncles" interspersed; and she concluded
LINE 654: her letter with a message of "affectionate love to Aunt Louise and the
LINE 655: children." Then at last King Leopold was obliged to recognise the facts.
LINE 656: His next letter contained no reference at all to politics. "I am glad,"
LINE 657: he wrote, "to find that you like Brighton better than last year. I think
LINE 658: Brighton very agreeable at this time of the year, till the east winds
LINE 659: set in. The pavilion, besides, is comfortable; that cannot be denied.
LINE 660: Before my marriage, it was there that I met the Regent. Charlotte
LINE 661: afterwards came with old Queen Charlotte. How distant all this already,
LINE 662: but still how present to one's memory." Like poor Madame de Lieven, His
LINE 663: Majesty felt that he had made a mistake.
LINE 664: Nevertheless, he could not quite give up all hope. Another opportunity
LINE 665: offered, and he made another effort--but there was not very much
LINE 666: conviction in it, and it was immediately crushed. "My dear Uncle," the
LINE 667: Queen wrote, "I have to thank you for your last letter which I received
LINE 668: on Sunday. Though you seem not to dislike my political sparks, I think
LINE 669: it is better not to increase them, as they might finally take fire,
LINE 670: particularly as I see with regret that upon this one subject we cannot
LINE 671: agree. I shall, therefore, limit myself to my expressions of very
LINE 672: sincere wishes for the welfare and prosperity of Belgium." After that,
LINE 673: it was clear that there was no more to be said. Henceforward there is
LINE 674: audible in the King's letters a curiously elegiac note. "My dearest
LINE 675: Victoria, your DELIGHTFUL little letter has just arrived and went
LINE 676: like AN ARROW TO MY HEART. Yes, my beloved Victoria! I DO LOVE YOU
LINE 677: TENDERLY... I love you FOR YOURSELF, and I love in you the dear child
LINE 678: whose welfare I tenderly watched." He had gone through much; yet, if
LINE 679: life had its disappointments, it had its satisfactions too. "I have
LINE 680: all the honours that can be given, and I am, politically speaking, very
LINE 681: solidly established." But there were other things besides politics,
LINE 682: there were romantic yearnings in his heart. "The only longing I still
LINE 683: have is for the Orient, where I perhaps shall once end my life, rising
LINE 684: in the west and setting in the east." As for his devotion to his
LINE 685: niece, that could never end. "I never press my services on you, nor my
LINE 686: councils, though I may say with some truth that from the extraordinary
LINE 687: fate which the higher powers had ordained for me, my experience, both
LINE 688: political and of private life, is great. I am ALWAYS READY to be useful
LINE 689: to you when and where and it may be, and I repeat it, ALL I WANT IN
LINE 690: RETURN IS SOME LITTLE SINCERE AFFECTION FROM YOU."
LINE 691: VI
LINE 692: The correspondence with King Leopold was significant of much that still
LINE 693: lay partly hidden in the character of Victoria. Her attitude towards
LINE 694: her uncle had never wavered for a moment. To all his advances she had
LINE 695: presented an absolutely unyielding front. The foreign policy of England
LINE 696: was not his province; it was hers and her Ministers'; his insinuations,
LINE 697: his entreaties, his struggles--all were quite useless; and he must
LINE 698: understand that this was so. The rigidity of her position was the more
LINE 699: striking owing to the respectfulness and the affection with which it was
LINE 700: accompanied. From start to finish the unmoved Queen remained the devoted
LINE 701: niece. Leopold himself must have envied such perfect correctitude; but
LINE 702: what may be admirable in an elderly statesman is alarming in a maiden
LINE 703: of nineteen. And privileged observers were not without their fears. The
LINE 704: strange mixture of ingenuous light-heartedness and fixed determination,
LINE 705: of frankness and reticence, of childishness and pride, seemed to augur
LINE 706: a future that was perplexed and full of dangers. As time passed the less
LINE 707: pleasant qualities in this curious composition revealed themselves more
LINE 708: often and more seriously. There were signs of an imperious, a peremptory
LINE 709: temper, an egotism that was strong and hard. It was noticed that the
LINE 710: palace etiquette, far from relaxing, grew ever more and more inflexible.
LINE 711: By some, this was attributed to Lehzen's influence; but, if that was
LINE 712: so, Lehzen had a willing pupil; for the slightest infringements of
LINE 713: the freezing rules of regularity and deference were invariably and
LINE 714: immediately visited by the sharp and haughty glances of the Queen. Yet
LINE 715: Her Majesty's eyes, crushing as they could be, were less crushing than
LINE 716: her mouth. The self-will depicted in those small projecting teeth and
LINE 717: that small receding chin was of a more dismaying kind than that which a
LINE 718: powerful jaw betokens; it was a self--will imperturbable, impenetrable,
LINE 719: unintelligent; a self-will dangerously akin to obstinacy. And the
LINE 720: obstinacy of monarchs is not as that of other men.
LINE 721: Within two years of her accession, the storm-clouds which, from the
LINE 722: first, had been dimly visible on the horizon, gathered and burst.
LINE 723: Victoria's relations with her mother had not improved. The Duchess
LINE 724: of Kent, still surrounded by all the galling appearances of filial
LINE 725: consideration, remained in Buckingham Palace a discarded figure,
LINE 726: powerless and inconsolable. Sir John Conroy, banished from the presence
LINE 727: of the Queen, still presided over the Duchess's household, and the
LINE 728: hostilities of Kensington continued unabated in the new surroundings.
LINE 729: Lady Flora Hastings still cracked her malicious jokes; the animosity of
LINE 730: the Baroness was still unappeased. One day, Lady Flora found the joke
LINE 731: was turned against her. Early in 1839, travelling in the suite of the
LINE 732: Duchess, she had returned from Scotland in the same carriage with Sir
LINE 733: John. A change in her figure became the subject of an unseemly jest;
LINE 734: tongues wagged; and the jest grew serious. It was whispered that Lady
LINE 735: Flora was with child. The state of her health seemed to confirm the
LINE 736: suspicion; she consulted Sir James Clark, the royal physician, and,
LINE 737: after the consultation, Sir James let his tongue wag, too. On this, the
LINE 738: scandal flared up sky-high. Everyone was talking; the Baroness was not
LINE 739: surprised; the Duchess rallied tumultuously to the support of her lady;
LINE 740: the Queen was informed. At last the extraordinary expedient of a medical
LINE 741: examination was resorted to, during which Sir James, according to Lady
LINE 742: Flora, behaved with brutal rudeness, while a second doctor was
LINE 743: extremely polite. Finally, both physicians signed a certificate entirely
LINE 744: exculpating the lady. But this was by no means the end of the business.
LINE 745: The Hastings family, socially a very powerful one, threw itself into
LINE 746: the fray with all the fury of outraged pride and injured innocence; Lord
LINE 747: Hastings insisted upon an audience of the Queen, wrote to the papers,
LINE 748: and demanded the dismissal of Sir James Clark. The Queen expressed her
LINE 749: regret to Lady Flora, but Sir James Clark was not dismissed. The tide
LINE 750: of opinion turned violently against the Queen and her advisers; high
LINE 751: society was disgusted by all this washing of dirty linen in Buckingham
LINE 752: Palace; the public at large was indignant at the ill-treatment of Lady
LINE 753: Flora. By the end of March, the popularity, so radiant and so abundant,
LINE 754: with which the young Sovereign had begun her reign, had entirely
LINE 755: disappeared.
LINE 756: There can be no doubt that a great lack of discretion had been shown by
LINE 757: the Court. Ill-natured tittle-tattle, which should have been instantly
LINE 758: nipped in the bud, had been allowed to assume disgraceful proportions;
LINE 759: and the Throne itself had become involved in the personal malignities
LINE 760: of the palace. A particularly awkward question had been raised by the
LINE 761: position of Sir James Clark. The Duke of Wellington, upon whom it was
LINE 762: customary to fall back, in cases of great difficulty in high places, had
LINE 763: been consulted upon this question, and he had given it as his opinion
LINE 764: that, as it would be impossible to remove Sir James without a public
LINE 765: enquiry, Sir James must certainly stay where he was. Probably the Duke
LINE 766: was right; but the fact that the peccant doctor continued in the
LINE 767: Queen's service made the Hastings family irreconcilable and produced an
LINE 768: unpleasant impression of unrepentant error upon the public mind. As for
LINE 769: Victoria, she was very young and quite inexperienced; and she can hardly
LINE 770: be blamed for having failed to control an extremely difficult situation.
LINE 771: That was clearly Lord Melbourne's task; he was a man of the world, and,
LINE 772: with vigilance and circumspection, he might have quietly put out the
LINE 773: ugly flames while they were still smouldering. He did not do so; he
LINE 774: was lazy and easy-going; the Baroness was persistent, and he let things
LINE 775: slide. But doubtless his position was not an easy one; passions ran
LINE 776: high in the palace; and Victoria was not only very young, she was very
LINE 777: headstrong, too. Did he possess the magic bridle which would curb
LINE 778: that fiery steed? He could not be certain. And then, suddenly, another
LINE 779: violent crisis revealed more unmistakably than ever the nature of the
LINE 780: mind with which he had to deal.
LINE 781: VII
LINE 782: The Queen had for long been haunted by a terror that the day might come
LINE 783: when she would be obliged to part with her Minister. Ever since the
LINE 784: passage of the Reform Bill, the power of the Whig Government had
LINE 785: steadily declined. The General Election of 1837 had left them with a
LINE 786: very small majority in the House of Commons; since then, they had been
LINE 787: in constant difflculties--abroad, at home, in Ireland; the Radical group
LINE 788: had grown hostile; it became highly doubtful how much longer they could
LINE 789: survive. The Queen watched the development of events in great anxiety.
LINE 790: She was a Whig by birth, by upbringing, by every association, public and
LINE 791: private; and, even if those ties had never existed, the mere fact that
LINE 792: Lord M. was the head of the Whigs would have amply sufficed to determine
LINE 793: her politics. The fall of the Whigs would mean a sad upset for Lord M.
LINE 794: But it would have a still more terrible consequence: Lord M. would have
LINE 795: to leave her; and the daily, the hourly, presence of Lord M. had become
LINE 796: an integral part of her life. Six months after her accession she had
LINE 797: noted in her diary "I shall be very sorry to lose him even for one
LINE 798: night;" and this feeling of personal dependence on her Minister steadily
LINE 799: increased. In these circumstances it was natural that she should have
LINE 800: become a Whig partisan. Of the wider significance of political questions
LINE 801: she knew nothing; all she saw was that her friends were in office and
LINE 802: about her, and that it would be dreadful if they ceased to be so. "I
LINE 803: cannot say," she wrote when a critical division was impending, "(though
LINE 804: I feel confident of our success) how low, how sad I feel, when I think
LINE 805: of the possibility of this excellent and truly kind man not remaining my
LINE 806: Minister! Yet I trust fervently that He who has so wonderfully protected
LINE 807: me through such manifold difficulties will not now desert me! I should
LINE 808: have liked to have expressed to Lord M. my anxiety, but the tears were
LINE 809: nearer than words throughout the time I saw him, and I felt I should
LINE 810: have choked, had I attempted to say anything." Lord Melbourne
LINE 811: realised clearly enough how undesirable was such a state of mind in
LINE 812: a constitutional sovereign who might be called upon at any moment to
LINE 813: receive as her Ministers the leaders of the opposite party; he did what
LINE 814: he could to cool her ardour; but in vain.
LINE 815: With considerable lack of foresight, too, he had himself helped to bring
LINE 816: about this unfortunate condition of affairs. From the moment of her
LINE 817: accession, he had surrounded the Queen with ladies of his own party; the
LINE 818: Mistress of the Robes and all the Ladies of the Bedchamber were Whigs.
LINE 819: In the ordinary course, the Queen never saw a Tory: eventually she took
LINE 820: pains never to see one in any circumstances. She disliked the whole
LINE 821: tribe; and she did not conceal the fact. She particularly disliked Sir
LINE 822: Robert Peel, who would almost certainly be the next Prime Minister.
LINE 823: His manners were detestable, and he wanted to turn out Lord M. His
LINE 824: supporters, without exception, were equally bad; and as for Sir James
LINE 825: Graham, she could not bear the sight of him; he was exactly like Sir
LINE 826: John Conroy.
LINE 827: The affair of Lady Flora intensified these party rumours still further.
LINE 828: The Hastings were Tories, and Lord Melbourne and the Court were attacked
LINE 829: by the Tory press in unmeasured language. The Queen's sectarian
LINE 830: zeal proportionately increased. But the dreaded hour was now fast
LINE 831: approaching. Early in May the Ministers were visibly tottering; on a
LINE 832: vital point of policy they could only secure a majority of five in the
LINE 833: House of Commons; they determined to resign. When Victoria heard the
LINE 834: news she burst into tears. Was it possible, then, that all was over? Was
LINE 835: she, indeed, about to see Lord M. for the last time? Lord M. came; and
LINE 836: it is a curious fact that, even in this crowning moment of misery and
LINE 837: agitation, the precise girl noted, to the minute, the exact time of the
LINE 838: arrival and the departure of her beloved Minister. The conversation was
LINE 839: touching and prolonged; but it could only end in one way--the Queen must
LINE 840: send for the Duke of Wellington. When, next morning, the Duke came, he
LINE 841: advised her Majesty to send for Sir Robert Peel. She was in "a state of
LINE 842: dreadful grief," but she swallowed down her tears, and braced herself,
LINE 843: with royal resolution, for the odious, odious interview.
LINE 844: Peel was by nature reserved, proud, and shy. His manners were not
LINE 845: perfect, and he knew it; he was easily embarrassed, and, at such
LINE 846: moments, he grew even more stiff and formal than before, while his
LINE 847: feet mechanically performed upon the carpet a dancing-master's measure.
LINE 848: Anxious as he now was to win the Queen's good graces, his very anxiety
LINE 849: to do so made the attainment of his object the more difficult. He
LINE 850: entirely failed to make any headway whatever with the haughty hostile
LINE 851: girl before him. She coldly noted that he appeared to be unhappy and
LINE 852: "put out," and, while he stood in painful fixity, with an occasional
LINE 853: uneasy pointing of the toe, her heart sank within her at the sight of
LINE 854: that manner, "Oh! how different, how dreadfully different, to the
LINE 855: frank, open, natural, and most kind warm manner of Lord Melbourne."
LINE 856: Nevertheless, the audience passed without disaster. Only at one point
LINE 857: had there been some slight hint of a disagreement. Peel had decided that
LINE 858: a change would be necessary in the composition of the royal Household:
LINE 859: the Queen must no longer be entirely surrounded by the wives and sisters
LINE 860: of his opponents; some, at any rate, of the Ladies of the Bedchamber
LINE 861: should be friendly to his Government. When this matter was touched
LINE 862: upon, the Queen had intimated that she wished her Household to remain
LINE 863: unchanged; to which Sir Robert had replied that the question could be
LINE 864: settled later, and shortly afterwards withdrew to arrange the details of
LINE 865: his Cabinet. While he was present, Victoria had remained, as she herself
LINE 866: said, "very much collected, civil and high, and betrayed no agitation;"
LINE 867: but as soon as she was alone she completely broke down. Then she pulled
LINE 868: herself together to write to Lord Melbourne an account of all that had
LINE 869: happened, and of her own wretchedness. "She feels," she said, "Lord
LINE 870: Melbourne will understand it, amongst enemies to those she most relied
LINE 871: on and most esteemed; but what is worst of all is the being deprived of
LINE 872: seeing Lord Melbourne as she used to do."
LINE 873: Lord Melbourne replied with a very wise letter. He attempted to calm the
LINE 874: Queen and to induce her to accept the new position gracefully; and he
LINE 875: had nothing but good words for the Tory leaders. As for the question of
LINE 876: the Ladies of the Household, the Queen, he said, should strongly urge
LINE 877: what she desired, as it was a matter which concerned her personally,
LINE 878: "but," he added, "if Sir Robert is unable to concede it, it will not do
LINE 879: to refuse and to put off the negotiation upon it." On this point there
LINE 880: can be little doubt that Lord Melbourne was right. The question was
LINE 881: a complicated and subtle one, and it had never arisen before; but
LINE 882: subsequent constitutional practice has determined that a Queen Regnant
LINE 883: must accede to the wishes of her Prime Minister as to the personnel of
LINE 884: the female part of her Household. Lord Melbourne's wisdom, however, was
LINE 885: wasted. The Queen would not be soothed, and still less would she take
LINE 886: advice. It was outrageous of the Tories to want to deprive her of her
LINE 887: Ladies, and that night she made up her mind that, whatever Sir Robert
LINE 888: might say, she would refuse to consent to the removal of a single one
LINE 889: of them. Accordingly, when, next morning, Peel appeared again, she was
LINE 890: ready for action. He began by detailing the Cabinet appointments, and
LINE 891: then he added "Now, ma'am, about the Ladies-" when the Queen sharply
LINE 892: interrupted him. "I cannot give up any of my Ladies," she said. "What,
LINE 893: ma'am!" said Sir Robert, "does your Majesty mean to retain them all?"
LINE 894: "All," said the Queen. Sir Robert's face worked strangely; he could not
LINE 895: conceal his agitation. "The Mistress of the Robes and the Ladies of
LINE 896: the Bedchamber?" he brought out at last. "All," replied once more her
LINE 897: Majesty. It was in vain that Peel pleaded and argued; in vain that
LINE 898: he spoke, growing every moment more pompous and uneasy, of the
LINE 899: constitution, and Queens Regnant, and the public interest; in vain that
LINE 900: he danced his pathetic minuet. She was adamant; but he, too, through all
LINE 901: his embarrassment, showed no sign of yielding; and when at last he left
LINE 902: her nothing had been decided--the whole formation of the Government was
LINE 903: hanging in the wind. A frenzy of excitement now seized upon Victoria.
LINE 904: Sir Robert, she believed in her fury, had tried to outwit her, to take
LINE 905: her friends from her, to impose his will upon her own; but that was
LINE 906: not all: she had suddenly perceived, while the poor man was moving so
LINE 907: uneasily before her, the one thing that she was desperately longing
LINE 908: for--a loop-hole of escape. She seized a pen and dashed off a note to
LINE 909: Lord Melbourne.
LINE 910: "Sir Robert has behaved very ill," she wrote, "he insisted on my giving
LINE 911: up my Ladies, to which I replied that I never would consent, and I never
LINE 912: saw a man so frightened... I was calm but very decided, and I think
LINE 913: you would have been pleased to see my composure and great firmness;
LINE 914: the Queen of England will not submit to such trickery. Keep yourself in
LINE 915: readiness, for you may soon be wanted." Hardly had she finished when the
LINE 916: Duke of Wellington was announced. "Well, Ma'am," he said as he entered,
LINE 917: "I am very sorry to find there is a difficulty." "Oh!" she instantly
LINE 918: replied, "he began it, not me." She felt that only one thing now was
LINE 919: needed: she must be firm. And firm she was. The venerable conqueror
LINE 920: of Napoleon was outfaced by the relentless equanimity of a girl in her
LINE 921: teens. He could not move the Queen one inch. At last, she even ventured
LINE 922: to rally him. "Is Sir Robert so weak," she asked, "that even the Ladies
LINE 923: must be of his opinion?" On which the Duke made a brief and humble
LINE 924: expostulation, bowed low, and departed.
LINE 925: Had she won? Time would show; and in the meantime she scribbled down
LINE 926: another letter. "Lord Melbourne must not think the Queen rash in her
LINE 927: conduct... The Queen felt this was an attempt to see whether she could
LINE 928: be led and managed like a child."(*) The Tories were not only wicked but
LINE 929: ridiculous. Peel, having, as she understood, expressed a wish to remove
LINE 930: only those members of the Household who were in Parliament, now objected
LINE 931: to her Ladies. "I should like to know," she exclaimed in triumphant
LINE 932: scorn, "if they mean to give the Ladies seats in Parliament?"
LINE 933: (*) The exclamation "They wished to treat me like a girl,
LINE 934: but I will show them that I am Queen of England!" often
LINE 935: quoted as the Queen's, is apocryphal. It is merely part of
LINE 936: Greville's summary of the two letters to Melbourne. It may
LINE 937: be noted that the phrase "the Queen of England will not
LINE 938: submit to such trickery" is omitted in "Girlhood," and in
LINE 939: general there are numerous verbal discrepancies between the
LINE 940: versions of the journal and the letters in the two books.
LINE 941: The end of the crisis was now fast approaching. Sir Robert returned, and
LINE 942: told her that if she insisted upon retaining all her Ladies he could
LINE 943: not form a Government. She replied that she would send him her final
LINE 944: decision in writing. Next morning the late Whig Cabinet met. Lord
LINE 945: Melbourne read to them the Queen's letters, and the group of elderly
LINE 946: politicians were overcome by an extraordinary wave of enthusiasm. They
LINE 947: knew very well that, to say the least, it was highly doubtful whether
LINE 948: the Queen had acted in strict accordance with the constitution; that in
LINE 949: doing what she had done she had brushed aside Lord Melbourne's advice;
LINE 950: that, in reality, there was no public reason whatever why they should
LINE 951: go back upon their decision to resign. But such considerations vanished
LINE 952: before the passionate urgency of Victoria. The intensity of her
LINE 953: determination swept them headlong down the stream of her desire. They
LINE 954: unanimously felt that "it was impossible to abandon such a Queen
LINE 955: and such a woman." Forgetting that they were no longer her Majesty's
LINE 956: Ministers, they took the unprecedented course of advising the Queen by
LINE 957: letter to put an end to her negotiation with Sir Robert Peel. She did
LINE 958: so; all was over; she had triumphed. That evening there was a ball at
LINE 959: the Palace. Everyone was present. "Peel and the Duke of Wellington came
LINE 960: by looking very much put out." She was perfectly happy; Lord M. was
LINE 961: Prime Minister once more, and he was by her side.
LINE 962: VIII
LINE 963: Happiness had returned with Lord M., but it was happiness in the midst
LINE 964: of agitation. The domestic imbroglio continued unabated, until at last
LINE 965: the Duke, rejected as a Minister, was called in once again in his old
LINE 966: capacity as moral physician to the family. Something was accomplished
LINE 967: when, at last, he induced Sir John Conroy to resign his place about the
LINE 968: Duchess of Kent and leave the Palace for ever; something more when he
LINE 969: persuaded the Queen to write an affectionate letter to her mother. The
LINE 970: way seemed open for a reconciliation, but the Duchess was stormy still.
LINE 971: She didn't believe that Victoria had written that letter; it was not
LINE 972: in her handwriting; and she sent for the Duke to tell him so. The Duke,
LINE 973: assuring her that the letter was genuine, begged her to forget the past.
LINE 974: But that was not so easy. "What am I to do if Lord Melbourne comes up to
LINE 975: me?" "Do, ma'am? Why, receive him with civility." Well, she would make
LINE 976: an effort... "But what am I to do if Victoria asks me to shake hands
LINE 977: with Lehzen?" "Do, ma'am? Why, take her in your arms and kiss her."
LINE 978: "What!" The Duchess bristled in every feather, and then she burst into
LINE 979: a hearty laugh. "No, ma'am, no," said the Duke, laughing too. "I don't
LINE 980: mean you are to take Lehzen in your arms and kiss her, but the
LINE 981: Queen." The Duke might perhaps have succeeded, had not all attempts at
LINE 982: conciliation been rendered hopeless by a tragical event. Lady Flora,
LINE 983: it was discovered, had been suffering from a terrible internal malady,
LINE 984: which now grew rapidly worse. There could be little doubt that she was
LINE 985: dying. The Queen's unpopularity reached an extraordinary height. More
LINE 986: than once she was publicly insulted. "Mrs. Melbourne," was shouted at
LINE 987: her when she appeared at her balcony; and, at Ascot, she was hissed
LINE 988: by the Duchess of Montrose and Lady Sarah Ingestre as she passed. Lady
LINE 989: Flora died. The whole scandal burst out again with redoubled vehemence;
LINE 990: while, in the Palace, the two parties were henceforth divided by an
LINE 991: impassable, a Stygian, gulf.
LINE 992: Nevertheless, Lord M. was back, and every trouble faded under the
LINE 993: enchantment of his presence and his conversation. He, on his side,
LINE 994: had gone through much; and his distresses were intensified by a
LINE 995: consciousness of his own shortcomings. He realised clearly enough that,
LINE 996: if he had intervened at the right moment, the Hastings scandal might
LINE 997: have been averted; and, in the bedchamber crisis, he knew that he had
LINE 998: allowed his judgment to be overruled and his conduct to be swayed by
LINE 999: private feelings and the impetuosity of Victoria. But he was not one
LINE 1000: to suffer too acutely from the pangs of conscience. In spite of the
LINE 1001: dullness and the formality of the Court, his relationship with the
LINE 1002: Queen had come to be the dominating interest in his life; to have been
LINE 1003: deprived of it would have been heartrending; that dread eventuality
LINE 1004: had been--somehow--avoided; he was installed once more, in a kind of
LINE 1005: triumph; let him enjoy the fleeting hours to the full! And so, cherished
LINE 1006: by the favour of a sovereign and warmed by the adoration of a girl,
LINE 1007: the autumn rose, in those autumn months of 1839, came to a wondrous
LINE 1008: blooming. The petals expanded, beautifully, for the last time. For
LINE 1009: the last time in this unlooked--for, this incongruous, this almost
LINE 1010: incredible intercourse, the old epicure tasted the exquisiteness of
LINE 1011: romance. To watch, to teach, to restrain, to encourage the royal
LINE 1012: young creature beside him--that was much; to feel with such a constant
LINE 1013: intimacy the impact of her quick affection, her radiant vitality--that
LINE 1014: was more; most of all, perhaps, was it good to linger vaguely in
LINE 1015: humorous contemplation, in idle apostrophe, to talk disconnectedly, to
LINE 1016: make a little joke about an apple or a furbelow, to dream. The springs
LINE 1017: of his sensibility, hidden deep within him, were overflowing. Often, as
LINE 1018: he bent over her hand and kissed it, he found himself in tears.
LINE 1019: Upon Victoria, with all her impermeability, it was inevitable that such
LINE 1020: a companionship should have produced, eventually, an effect. She was no
LINE 1021: longer the simple schoolgirl of two years since. The change was visible
LINE 1022: even in her public demeanour. Her expression, once "ingenuous
LINE 1023: and serene," now appeared to a shrewd observer to be "bold and
LINE 1024: discontented." She had learnt something of the pleasures of power and
LINE 1025: the pains of it; but that was not all. Lord Melbourne with his gentle
LINE 1026: instruction had sought to lead her into the paths of wisdom and
LINE 1027: moderation, but the whole unconscious movement of his character had
LINE 1028: swayed her in a very different direction. The hard clear pebble,
LINE 1029: subjected for so long and so constantly to that encircling and insidious
LINE 1030: fluidity, had suffered a curious corrosion; it seemed to be actually
LINE 1031: growing a little soft and a little clouded. Humanity and fallibility are
LINE 1032: infectious things; was it possible that Lehzen's prim pupil had caught
LINE 1033: them? That she was beginning to listen to siren voices? That the secret
LINE 1034: impulses of self-expression, of self-indulgence even, were mastering
LINE 1035: her life? For a moment the child of a new age looked back, and wavered
LINE 1036: towards the eighteenth century. It was the most critical moment of her
LINE 1037: career. Had those influences lasted, the development of her character,
LINE 1038: the history of her life, would have been completely changed.
LINE 1039: And why should they not last? She, for one, was very anxious that they
LINE 1040: should. Let them last for ever! She was surrounded by Whigs, she was
LINE 1041: free to do whatever she wanted, she had Lord M.; she could not believe
LINE 1042: that she could ever be happier. Any change would be for the worse; and
LINE 1043: the worst change of all... no, she would not hear of it; it would be
LINE 1044: quite intolerable, it would upset everything, if she were to marry. And
LINE 1045: yet everyone seemed to want her to--the general public, the Ministers,
LINE 1046: her Saxe-Coburg relations--it was always the same story. Of course, she
LINE 1047: knew very well that there were excellent reasons for it. For one thing,
LINE 1048: if she remained childless, and were to die, her uncle Cumberland, who
LINE 1049: was now the King of Hanover, would succeed to the Throne of England.
LINE 1050: That, no doubt, would be a most unpleasant event; and she entirely
LINE 1051: sympathised with everybody who wished to avoid it. But there was no
LINE 1052: hurry; naturally, she would marry in the end--but not just yet--not for
LINE 1053: three or four years. What was tiresome was that her uncle Leopold had
LINE 1054: apparently determined, not only that she ought to marry, but that her
LINE 1055: cousin Albert ought to be her husband. That was very like her uncle
LINE 1056: Leopold, who wanted to have a finger in every pie; and it was true that
LINE 1057: long ago, in far-off days, before her accession even, she had written to
LINE 1058: him in a way which might well have encouraged him in such a notion. She
LINE 1059: had told him then that Albert possessed "every quality that could be
LINE 1060: desired to render her perfectly happy," and had begged her "dearest
LINE 1061: uncle to take care of the health of one, now so dear to me, and to take
LINE 1062: him under your special protection," adding, "I hope and trust all will
LINE 1063: go on prosperously and well on this subject of so much importance to
LINE 1064: me." But that had been years ago, when she was a mere child; perhaps,
LINE 1065: indeed, to judge from the language, the letter had been dictated by
LINE 1066: Lehzen; at any rate, her feelings, and all the circumstances, had now
LINE 1067: entirely changed. Albert hardly interested her at all.
LINE 1068: In later life the Queen declared that she had never for a moment dreamt
LINE 1069: of marrying anyone but her cousin; her letters and diaries tell a very
LINE 1070: different story. On August 26, 1837, she wrote in her journal: "To-day
LINE 1071: is my dearest cousin Albert's 18th birthday, and I pray Heaven to pour
LINE 1072: its choicest blessings on his beloved head!" In the subsequent years,
LINE 1073: however, the date passes unnoticed. It had been arranged that Stockmar
LINE 1074: should accompany the Prince to Italy, and the faithful Baron left her
LINE 1075: side for that purpose. He wrote to her more than once with sympathetic
LINE 1076: descriptions of his young companion; but her mind was by this time made
LINE 1077: up. She liked and admired Albert very much, but she did not want to
LINE 1078: marry him. "At present," she told Lord Melbourne in April, 1839, "my
LINE 1079: feeling is quite against ever marrying." When her cousin's Italian tour
LINE 1080: came to an end, she began to grow nervous; she knew that, according to a
LINE 1081: long-standing engagement, his next journey would be to England. He would
LINE 1082: probably arrive in the autumn, and by July her uneasiness was intense.
LINE 1083: She determined to write to her uncle, in order to make her position
LINE 1084: clear. It must be understood she said, that "there is no no engagement
LINE 1085: between us." If she should like Albert, she could "make no final promise
LINE 1086: this year, for, at the very earliest, any such event could not take
LINE 1087: place till two or three years hence." She had, she said, "a great
LINE 1088: repugnance" to change her present position; and, if she should not like
LINE 1089: him, she was "very anxious that it should be understood that she would
LINE 1090: not be guilty of any breach of promise, for she never gave any." To Lord
LINE 1091: Melbourne she was more explicit. She told him that she "had no great
LINE 1092: wish to see Albert, as the whole subject was an odious one;" she hated
LINE 1093: to have to decide about it; and she repeated once again that seeing
LINE 1094: Albert would be "a disagreeable thing." But there was no escaping the
LINE 1095: horrid business; the visit must be made, and she must see him. The
LINE 1096: summer slipped by and was over; it was the autumn already; on the
LINE 1097: evening of October 10 Albert, accompanied by his brother Ernest, arrived
LINE 1098: at Windsor.
LINE 1099: Albert arrived; and the whole structure of her existence crumbled into
LINE 1100: nothingness like a house of cards. He was beautiful--she gasped--she
LINE 1101: knew no more. Then, in a flash, a thousand mysteries were revealed to
LINE 1102: her; the past, the present, rushed upon her with a new significance; the
LINE 1103: delusions of years were abolished, and an extraordinary, an irresistible
LINE 1104: certitude leapt into being in the light of those blue eyes, the smile
LINE 1105: of that lovely mouth. The succeeding hours passed in a rapture. She was
LINE 1106: able to observe a few more details--the "exquisite nose," the "delicate
LINE 1107: moustachios and slight but very slight whiskers," the "beautiful figure,
LINE 1108: broad in the shoulders and a fine waist." She rode with him, danced with
LINE 1109: him, talked with him, and it was all perfection. She had no shadow of
LINE 1110: a doubt. He had come on a Thursday evening, and on the following Sunday
LINE 1111: morning she told Lord Melbourne that she had "a good deal changed her
LINE 1112: opinion as to marrying." Next morning, she told him that she had made
LINE 1113: up her mind to marry Albert. The morning after that, she sent for her
LINE 1114: cousin. She received him alone, and "after a few minutes I said to him
LINE 1115: that I thought he must be aware why I wished them to come here--and
LINE 1116: that it would make me too happy if he would consent to what I wished
LINE 1117: (to marry me.)" Then "we embraced each other, and he was so kind, so
LINE 1118: affectionate." She said that she was quite unworthy of him, while he
LINE 1119: murmured that he would be very happy "Das Leben mit dir zu zubringen."
LINE 1120: They parted, and she felt "the happiest of human beings," when Lord M.
LINE 1121: came in. At first she beat about the bush, and talked of the weather,
LINE 1122: and indifferent subjects. Somehow or other she felt a little nervous
LINE 1123: with her old friend. At last, summoning up her courage, she said, "I
LINE 1124: have got well through this with Albert." "Oh! you have," said Lord M.
