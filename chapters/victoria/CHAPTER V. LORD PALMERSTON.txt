LINE 1: I
LINE 2: In 1851 the Prince's fortunes reached their high-water mark. The success
LINE 3: of the Great Exhibition enormously increased his reputation and seemed
LINE 4: to assure him henceforward a leading place in the national life. But
LINE 5: before the year was out another triumph, in a very different sphere of
LINE 6: action, was also his. This triumph, big with fateful consequences, was
LINE 7: itself the outcome of a series of complicated circumstances which had
LINE 8: been gathering to a climax for many years.
LINE 9: The unpopularity of Albert in high society had not diminished with time.
LINE 10: Aristocratic persons continued to regard him with disfavour; and he on
LINE 11: his side, withdrew further and further into a contemptuous reserve. For
LINE 12: a moment, indeed, it appeared as if the dislike of the upper classes
LINE 13: was about to be suddenly converted into cordiality; for they learnt with
LINE 14: amazement that the Prince, during a country visit, had ridden to hounds
LINE 15: and acquitted himself remarkably well. They had always taken it for
LINE 16: granted that his horsemanship was of some second-rate foreign quality,
LINE 17: and here he was jumping five-barred gates and tearing after the fox
LINE 18: as if he had been born and bred in Leicestershire. They could hardly
LINE 19: believe it; was it possible that they had made a mistake, and that
LINE 20: Albert was a good fellow after all? Had he wished to be thought so he
LINE 21: would certainly have seized this opportunity, purchased several hunters,
LINE 22: and used them constantly. But he had no such desire; hunting bored
LINE 23: him, and made Victoria nervous. He continued, as before, to ride, as he
LINE 24: himself put it, for exercise or convenience, not for amusement; and it
LINE 25: was agreed that though the Prince, no doubt, could keep in his saddle
LINE 26: well enough, he was no sportsman.
LINE 27: This was a serious matter. It was not merely that Albert was laughed at
LINE 28: by fine ladies and sneered at by fine gentlemen; it was not merely that
LINE 29: Victoria, who before her marriage had cut some figure in society, had,
LINE 30: under her husband's influence, almost completely given it up. Since
LINE 31: Charles the Second the sovereigns of England had, with a single
LINE 32: exception, always been unfashionable; and the fact that the exception
LINE 33: was George the Fourth seemed to give an added significance to the rule.
LINE 34: What was grave was not the lack of fashion, but the lack of other
LINE 35: and more important qualities. The hostility of the upper classes was
LINE 36: symptomatic of an antagonism more profound than one of manners or
LINE 37: even of tastes. The Prince, in a word, was un-English. What that word
LINE 38: precisely meant it was difficult to say; but the fact was patent to
LINE 39: every eye. Lord Palmerston, also, was not fashionable; the great
LINE 40: Whig aristocrats looked askance at him, and only tolerated him as an
LINE 41: unpleasant necessity thrust upon them by fate. But Lord Palmerston was
LINE 42: English through and through, there was something in him that expressed,
LINE 43: with extraordinary vigour, the fundamental qualities of the English
LINE 44: race. And he was the very antithesis of the Prince. By a curious chance
LINE 45: it so happened that this typical Englishman was brought into closer
LINE 46: contact than any other of his countrymen with the alien from over
LINE 47: the sea. It thus fell out that differences which, in more fortunate
LINE 48: circumstances, might have been smoothed away and obliterated, became
LINE 49: accentuated to the highest pitch. All the mysterious forces in Albert's
LINE 50: soul leapt out to do battle with his adversary, and, in the long and
LINE 51: violent conflict that followed, it almost seemed as if he was struggling
LINE 52: with England herself.
LINE 53: Palmerston's whole life had been spent in the government of the country.
LINE 54: At twenty-two he had been a Minister; at twenty-five he had been offered
LINE 55: the Chancellorship of the Exchequer, which, with that prudence which
LINE 56: formed so unexpected a part of his character, he had declined to accept.
LINE 57: His first spell of office had lasted uninterruptedly for twenty-one
LINE 58: years. When Lord Grey came into power he received the Foreign
LINE 59: Secretaryship, a post which he continued to occupy, with two intervals,
LINE 60: for another twenty-one years. Throughout this period his reputation
LINE 61: with the public had steadily grown, and when, in 1846, he became Foreign
LINE 62: Secretary for the third time, his position in the country was almost,
LINE 63: if not quite, on an equality with that of the Prime Minister, Lord John
LINE 64: Russell. He was a tall, big man of sixty-two, with a jaunty air, a large
LINE 65: face, dyed whiskers, and a long sardonic upper lip. His private life was
LINE 66: far from respectable, but he had greatly strengthened his position
LINE 67: in society by marrying, late in life, Lady Cowper, the sister of Lord
LINE 68: Melbourne, and one of the most influential of the Whig hostesses.
LINE 69: Powerful, experienced, and supremely self-confident, he naturally
LINE 70: paid very little attention to Albert. Why should he? The Prince was
LINE 71: interested in foreign affairs? Very well, then; let the Prince pay
LINE 72: attention to him--to him, who had been a Cabinet Minister when Albert
LINE 73: was in the cradle, who was the chosen leader of a great nation, and who
LINE 74: had never failed in anything he had undertaken in the whole course of
LINE 75: his life. Not that he wanted the Prince's attention--far from it: so far
LINE 76: as he could see, Albert was merely a young foreigner, who suffered from
LINE 77: having no vices, and whose only claim to distinction was that he had
LINE 78: happened to marry the Queen of England. This estimate, as he found out
LINE 79: to his cost, was a mistaken one. Albert was by no means insignificant,
LINE 80: and, behind Albert, there was another figure by no means insignificant
LINE 81: either--there was Stockmar.
LINE 82: But Palmerston, busy with his plans, his ambitions, and the management
LINE 83: of a great department, brushed all such considerations on one side; it
LINE 84: was his favourite method of action. He lived by instinct--by a quick eye
LINE 85: and a strong hand, a dexterous management of every crisis as it arose, a
LINE 86: half-unconscious sense of the vital elements in a situation. He was very
LINE 87: bold; and nothing gave him more exhilaration than to steer the ship of
LINE 88: state in a high wind, on a rough sea, with every stitch of canvas on her
LINE 89: that she could carry. But there is a point beyond which boldness becomes
LINE 90: rashness--a point perceptible only to intuition and not to reason;
LINE 91: and beyond that point Palmerston never went. When he saw that the cast
LINE 92: demanded it, he could go slow--very slow indeed in fact, his whole
LINE 93: career, so full of vigorous adventure, was nevertheless a masterly
LINE 94: example of the proverb, "tout vient a point a qui sait attendre." But
LINE 95: when he decided to go quick, nobody went quicker. One day, returning
LINE 96: from Osborne, he found that he had missed the train to London; he
LINE 97: ordered a special, but the station master told him that to put a special
LINE 98: train upon the line at that time of day would be dangerous and he
LINE 99: could not allow it. Palmerston insisted declaring that he had important
LINE 100: business in London, which could not wait. The station-master supported
LINE 101: by all the officials, continued to demur the company, he said, could
LINE 102: not possibly take the responsibility. "On MY responsibility, then!" said
LINE 103: Palmerston, in his off-hand, peremptory way whereupon the station-master
LINE 104: ordered up the train and the Foreign Secretary reached London in time
LINE 105: for his work, without an accident. The story, is typical of the happy
LINE 106: valiance with which he conducted both his own affairs and those of
LINE 107: the nation. "England," he used to say, "is strong enough to brave
LINE 108: consequences." Apparently, under Palmerston's guidance, she was. While
LINE 109: the officials protested and shook in their shoes, he would wave them
LINE 110: away with his airy "MY responsibility!" and carry the country swiftly
LINE 111: along the line of his choice, to a triumphant destination--without an
LINE 112: accident. His immense popularity was the result partly of his diplomatic
LINE 113: successes, partly of his extraordinary personal affability, but chiefly
LINE 114: of the genuine intensity with which he responded to the feelings and
LINE 115: supported the interests of his countrymen. The public knew that it had
LINE 116: in Lord Palmerston not only a high-mettled master, but also a devoted
LINE 117: servant--that he was, in every sense of the word, a public man. When he
LINE 118: was Prime Minister, he noticed that iron hurdles had been put up on
LINE 119: the grass in the Green Park; he immediately wrote to the Minister
LINE 120: responsible, ordering, in the severest language, their instant removal,
LINE 121: declaring that they were "an intolerable nuisance," and that the purpose
LINE 122: of the grass was "to be walked upon freely and without restraint by the
LINE 123: people, old and young, for whose enjoyment the parks are maintained."
LINE 124: It was in this spirit that, as Foreign Secretary, he watched over the
LINE 125: interests of Englishmen abroad. Nothing could be more agreeable for
LINE 126: Englishmen; but foreign governments were less pleased. They found Lord
LINE 127: Palmerston interfering, exasperating, and alarming. In Paris they spoke
LINE 128: with bated breath of "ce terrible milord Palmerston;" and in Germany
LINE 129: they made a little song about him--
LINE 130: "Hat der Teufel einen Sohn,
LINE 131: So ist er sicher Palmerston."
LINE 132: But their complaints, their threats, and their agitations were all
LINE 133: in vain. Palmerston, with his upper lip sardonically curving, braved
LINE 134: consequences, and held on his course.
LINE 135: The first diplomatic crisis which arose after his return to office,
LINE 136: though the Prince and the Queen were closely concerned with it, passed
LINE 137: off without serious disagreement between the Court and the Minister. For
LINE 138: some years past a curious problem had been perplexing the chanceries
LINE 139: of Europe. Spain, ever since the time of Napoleon a prey to civil
LINE 140: convulsions, had settled down for a short interval to a state of
LINE 141: comparative quiet under the rule of Christina, the Queen Mother, and her
LINE 142: daughter Isabella, the young Queen. In 1846, the question of
LINE 143: Isabella's marriage, which had for long been the subject of diplomatic
LINE 144: speculations, suddenly became acute. Various candidates for her hand
LINE 145: were proposed--among others, two cousins of her own, another Spanish
LINE 146: prince, and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, a first cousin of Victoria's
LINE 147: and Albert's; for different reasons, however, none of these young men
LINE 148: seemed altogether satisfactory. Isabella was not yet sixteen; and it
LINE 149: might have been supposed that her marriage could be put off for a few
LINE 150: years more; but this was considered to be out of the question. "Vous
LINE 151: ne savez pas," said a high authority, "ce que c'est que ces princesses
LINE 152: espagnoles; elles ont le diable au corps, et on a toujours dit que si
LINE 153: nous ne nous hations pas, l'heritier viendrait avant le mari." It might
LINE 154: also have been supposed that the young Queen's marriage was a matter to
LINE 155: be settled by herself, her mother, and the Spanish Government; but
LINE 156: this again was far from being the case. It had become, by one of those
LINE 157: periodical reversions to the ways of the eighteenth century, which,
LINE 158: it is rumoured, are still not unknown in diplomacy, a question of
LINE 159: dominating importance in the foreign policies both of France and
LINE 160: England. For several years, Louis Philippe and his Prime Minister Guizot
LINE 161: had been privately maturing a very subtle plan. It was the object of the
LINE 162: French King to repeat the glorious coup of Louis XIV, and to abolish
LINE 163: the Pyrenees by placing one of his grandsons on the throne of Spain.
LINE 164: In order to bring this about, he did not venture to suggest that his
LINE 165: younger son, the Duc de Montpensier, should marry Isabella; that would
LINE 166: have been too obvious a move, which would have raised immediate and
LINE 167: insurmountable opposition. He therefore proposed that Isabella
LINE 168: should marry her cousin, the Duke of Cadiz, while Montpensier married
LINE 169: Isabella's younger sister, the Infanta Fernanda; and pray, what possible
LINE 170: objection could there be to that? The wily old King whispered into
LINE 171: the chaste ears of Guizot the key to the secret; he had good reason to
LINE 172: believe that the Duke of Cadiz was incapable of having children, and
LINE 173: therefore the offspring of Fernanda would inherit the Spanish crown.
LINE 174: Guizot rubbed his hands, and began at once to set the necessary springs
LINE 175: in motion; but, of course, the whole scheme was very soon divulged and
LINE 176: understood. The English Government took an extremely serious view of
LINE 177: the matter; the balance of power was clearly at stake, and the French
LINE 178: intrigue must be frustrated at all hazards. A diplomatic struggle of
LINE 179: great intensity followed; and it occasionally appeared that a second War
LINE 180: of the Spanish Succession was about to break out. This was avoided,
LINE 181: but the consequences of this strange imbroglio were far-reaching and
LINE 182: completely different from what any of the parties concerned could have
LINE 183: guessed.
LINE 184: In the course of the long and intricate negotiations there was one point
LINE 185: upon which Louis Philippe laid a special stress--the candidature of
LINE 186: Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. The prospect of a marriage between a
LINE 187: Coburg Prince and the Queen of Spain was, he declared, at least as
LINE 188: threatening to the balance of power in Europe as that of a marriage
LINE 189: between the Duc de Montpensier and the Infanta; and, indeed, there was
LINE 190: much to be said for this contention. The ruin which had fallen upon the
LINE 191: House of Coburg during the Napoleonic wars had apparently only served
LINE 192: to multiply its vitality, for that princely family had by now extended
LINE 193: itself over Europe in an extraordinary manner. King Leopold was firmly
LINE 194: fixed in Belgium; his niece was Queen of England; one of his nephews
LINE 195: was the husband of the Queen of England, and another the husband of the
LINE 196: Queen of Portugal; yet another was Duke of Wurtemberg. Where was this
LINE 197: to end? There seemed to be a Coburg Trust ready to send out one of
LINE 198: its members at any moment to fill up any vacant place among the ruling
LINE 199: families of Europe. And even beyond Europe there were signs of this
LINE 200: infection spreading. An American who had arrived in Brussels had assured
LINE 201: King Leopold that there was a strong feeling in the United States in
LINE 202: favour of monarchy instead of the misrule of mobs, and had suggested, to
LINE 203: the delight of His Majesty, that some branch of the Coburg family might
LINE 204: be available for the position. That danger might, perhaps, be remote;
LINE 205: but the Spanish danger was close at hand; and if Prince Leopold were to
LINE 206: marry Queen Isabella the position of France would be one of humiliation,
LINE 207: if not of positive danger. Such were the asseverations of Louis
LINE 208: Philippe. The English Government had no wish to support Prince Leopold,
LINE 209: and though Albert and Victoria had some hankerings for the match, the
LINE 210: wisdom of Stockmar had induced them to give up all thoughts of it. The
LINE 211: way thus seemed open for a settlement: England would be reasonable about
LINE 212: Leopold, if France would be reasonable about Montpensier. At the Chateau
LINE 213: d'Eu, the agreement was made, in a series of conversations between the
LINE 214: King and Guizot on the one side, and the Queen, the Prince, and Lord
LINE 215: Aberdeen on the other. Aberdeen, as Foreign Minister, declared that
LINE 216: England would neither recognise nor support Prince Leopold as a
LINE 217: candidate for the hand of the Queen of Spain; while Louis Philippe
LINE 218: solemnly promised, both to Aberdeen and to Victoria, that the Duc de
LINE 219: Montpensier should not marry the Infanta Fernanda until after the Queen
LINE 220: was married and had issue. All went well, and the crisis seemed to be
LINE 221: over, when the whole question was suddenly re-opened by Palmerston,
LINE 222: who had succeeded Aberdeen at the Foreign Office. In a despatch to
LINE 223: the English Minister at Madrid, he mentioned, in a list of possible
LINE 224: candidates for Queen Isabella's hand, Prince Leopold of Coburg; and
LINE 225: at the same time he took occasion to denounce in violent language the
LINE 226: tyranny and incompetence of the Spanish Government. This despatch,
LINE 227: indiscreet in any case, was rendered infinitely more so by being
LINE 228: communicated to Guizot. Louis Philippe saw his opportunity and pounced
LINE 229: on it. Though there was nothing in Palmerston's language to show that he
LINE 230: either recognised or supported Prince Leopold, the King at once assumed
LINE 231: that the English had broken their engagement, and that he was therefore
LINE 232: free to do likewise. He then sent the despatch to the Queen Mother,
LINE 233: declared that the English were intriguing for the Coburg marriage, bade
LINE 234: her mark the animosity of Palmerston against the Spanish Government, and
LINE 235: urged her to escape from her difficulties and ensure the friendship
LINE 236: of France by marrying Isabella to the Duke of Cadiz and Fernanda
LINE 237: to Montpensier. The Queen Mother, alarmed and furious, was easily
LINE 238: convinced. There was only one difficulty: Isabella loathed the very
LINE 239: sight of her cousin. But this was soon surmounted; there was a wild
LINE 240: supper-party at the Palace, and in the course of it the young girl was
LINE 241: induced to consent to anything that was asked of her. Shortly after, and
LINE 242: on the same day, both the marriages took place.
LINE 243: The news burst like a bomb on the English Government, who saw with rage
LINE 244: and mortification that they had been completely outmanoeuvred by the
LINE 245: crafty King. Victoria, in particular, was outraged. Not only had she
LINE 246: been the personal recipient of Louis Philippe's pledge, but he had won
LINE 247: his way to her heart by presenting the Prince of Wales with a box of
LINE 248: soldiers and sending the Princess Royal a beautiful Parisian doll with
LINE 249: eyes that opened and shut. And now insult was added to injury. The Queen
LINE 250: of the French wrote her a formal letter, calmly announcing, as a family
LINE 251: event in which she was sure Victoria would be interested, the marriage
LINE 252: of her son, Montpensier--"qui ajoutera a notre bonheur interieur, le
LINE 253: seul vrai dans ce monde, et que vous, madame, savez si bien apprecier."
LINE 254: But the English Queen had not long to wait for her revenge. Within
LINE 255: eighteen months the monarchy of Louis Philippe, discredited, unpopular,
LINE 256: and fatally weakened by the withdrawal of English support, was swept
LINE 257: into limbo, while he and his family threw themselves as suppliant
LINE 258: fugitives at the feet of Victoria.
LINE 259: II
LINE 260: In this affair both the Queen and the Prince had been too much occupied
LINE 261: with the delinquencies of Louis Philippe to have any wrath to spare
LINE 262: for those of Palmerston; and, indeed, on the main issue, Palmerston's
LINE 263: attitude and their own had been in complete agreement. But in this the
LINE 264: case was unique. In every other foreign complication--and they were many
LINE 265: and serious--during the ensuing years, the differences between the royal
LINE 266: couple and the Foreign Secretary were constant and profound. There was a
LINE 267: sharp quarrel over Portugal, where violently hostile parties were flying
LINE 268: at each other's throats. The royal sympathy was naturally enlisted on
LINE 269: behalf of the Queen and her Coburg husband, while Palmerston gave his
LINE 270: support to the progressive elements in the country. It was not until
LINE 271: 1848, however, that the strain became really serious. In that year of
LINE 272: revolutions, when, in all directions and with alarming frequency, crowns
LINE 273: kept rolling off royal heads, Albert and Victoria were appalled to find
LINE 274: that the policy of England was persistently directed--in Germany,
LINE 275: in Switzerland, in Austria, in Italy, in Sicily--so as to favour the
LINE 276: insurgent forces. The situation, indeed, was just such a one as the soul
LINE 277: of Palmerston loved. There was danger and excitement, the necessity
LINE 278: of decision, the opportunity for action, on every hand. A disciple of
LINE 279: Canning, with an English gentleman's contempt and dislike of foreign
LINE 280: potentates deep in his heart, the spectacle of the popular uprisings,
LINE 281: and of the oppressors bundled ignominiously out of the palaces they had
LINE 282: disgraced, gave him unbounded pleasure, and he was determined that there
LINE 283: should be no doubt whatever, all over the Continent, on which side in
LINE 284: the great struggle England stood. It was not that he had the slightest
LINE 285: tincture in him of philosophical radicalism; he had no philosophical
LINE 286: tinctures of any kind; he was quite content to be inconsistent--to be a
LINE 287: Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad. There were very good reasons
LINE 288: for keeping the Irish in their places; but what had that to do with it?
LINE 289: The point was this--when any decent man read an account of the political
LINE 290: prisons in Naples his gorge rose. He did not want war; but he saw that
LINE 291: without war a skilful and determined use of England's power might do
LINE 292: much to further the cause of the Liberals in Europe. It was a difficult
LINE 293: and a hazardous game to play, but he set about playing it with delighted
LINE 294: alacrity. And then, to his intense annoyance, just as he needed all
LINE 295: his nerve and all possible freedom of action, he found himself being
LINE 296: hampered and distracted at every turn by... those people at Osborne.
LINE 297: He saw what it was; the opposition was systematic and informed, and
LINE 298: the Queen alone would have been incapable of it; the Prince was at the
LINE 299: bottom of the whole thing. It was exceedingly vexatious; but Palmerston
LINE 300: was in a hurry, and could not wait; the Prince, if he would insist upon
LINE 301: interfering, must be brushed on one side.
LINE 302: Albert was very angry. He highly disapproved both of Palmerston's policy
LINE 303: and of his methods of action. He was opposed to absolutism; but in his
LINE 304: opinion Palmerston's proceedings were simply calculated to substitute
LINE 305: for absolutism, all over Europe, something no better and very possibly
LINE 306: worse--the anarchy of faction and mob violence. The dangers of
LINE 307: this revolutionary ferment were grave; even in England Chartism was
LINE 308: rampant--a sinister movement, which might at any moment upset the
LINE 309: Constitution and abolish the Monarchy. Surely, with such dangers at
LINE 310: home, this was a very bad time to choose for encouraging lawlessness
LINE 311: abroad. He naturally took a particular interest in Germany. His
LINE 312: instincts, his affections, his prepossessions, were ineradicably German;
LINE 313: Stockmar was deeply involved in German politics; and he had a multitude
LINE 314: of relatives among the ruling German families, who, from the midst of
LINE 315: the hurly-burly of revolution, wrote him long and agitated letters once
LINE 316: a week. Having considered the question of Germany's future from every
LINE 317: point of view, he came to the conclusion, under Stockmar's guidance,
LINE 318: that the great aim for every lover of Germany should be her unification
LINE 319: under the sovereignty of Prussia. The intricacy of the situation was
LINE 320: extreme, and the possibilities of good or evil which every hour might
LINE 321: bring forth were incalculable; yet he saw with horror that Palmerston
LINE 322: neither understood nor cared to understand the niceties of this
LINE 323: momentous problem, but rushed on blindly, dealing blows to right and
LINE 324: left, quite--so far as he could see--without system, and even without
LINE 325: motive--except, indeed, a totally unreasonable distrust of the Prussian
LINE 326: State.
LINE 327: But his disagreement with the details of Palmerston's policy was in
LINE 328: reality merely a symptom of the fundamental differences between the
LINE 329: characters of the two men. In Albert's eyes Palmerston was a coarse,
LINE 330: reckless egotist, whose combined arrogance and ignorance must
LINE 331: inevitably have their issue in folly and disaster. Nothing could be more
LINE 332: antipathetic to him than a mind so strangely lacking in patience, in
LINE 333: reflection, in principle, and in the habits of ratiocination. For to him
LINE 334: it was intolerable to think in a hurry, to jump to slapdash decisions,
LINE 335: to act on instincts that could not be explained. Everything must be done
LINE 336: in due order, with careful premeditation; the premises of the position
LINE 337: must first be firmly established; and he must reach the correct
LINE 338: conclusion by a regular series of rational steps. In complicated
LINE 339: questions--and what questions, rightly looked at, were not
LINE 340: complicated?--to commit one's thoughts to paper was the wisest course,
LINE 341: and it was the course which Albert, laborious though it might be,
LINE 342: invariably adopted. It was as well, too, to draw up a reasoned statement
LINE 343: after an event, as well as before it; and accordingly, whatever
LINE 344: happened, it was always found that the Prince had made a memorandum.
LINE 345: On one occasion he reduced to six pages of foolscap the substance of a
LINE 346: confidential conversation with Sir Robert Peel, and, having read them
LINE 347: aloud to him, asked him to append his signature; Sir Robert, who never
LINE 348: liked to commit himself, became extremely uneasy; upon which the
LINE 349: Prince, understanding that it was necessary to humour the singular
LINE 350: susceptibilities of Englishmen, with great tact dropped that particular
LINE 351: memorandum into the fire. But as for Palmerston, he never even gave one
LINE 352: so much as a chance to read him a memorandum, he positively seemed to
LINE 353: dislike discussion; and, before one knew where one was, without any
LINE 354: warning whatever, he would plunge into some hare-brained, violent
LINE 355: project, which, as likely as not, would logically involve a European
LINE 356: war. Closely connected, too, with this cautious, painstaking
LINE 357: reasonableness of Albert's, was his desire to examine questions
LINE 358: thoroughly from every point of view, to go down to the roots of things,
LINE 359: and to act in strict accordance with some well-defined principle. Under
LINE 360: Stockmar's tutelage he was constantly engaged in enlarging his outlook
LINE 361: and in endeavouring to envisage vital problems both theoretically and
LINE 362: practically--both with precision and with depth. To one whose mind was
LINE 363: thus habitually occupied, the empirical activities of Palmerston, who
LINE 364: had no notion what a principle meant, resembled the incoherent vagaries
LINE 365: of a tiresome child. What did Palmerston know of economics, of science,
LINE 366: of history? What did he care for morality and education? How much
LINE 367: consideration had he devoted in the whole course of his life to the
LINE 368: improvement of the condition of the working-classes and to the general
LINE 369: amelioration of the human race? The answers to such questions were all
LINE 370: too obvious; and yet it is easy to imagine, also, what might have been
LINE 371: Palmerston's jaunty comment. "Ah! your Royal Highness is busy with fine
LINE 372: schemes and beneficent calculations exactly! Well, as for me, I must say
LINE 373: I'm quite satisfied with my morning's work--I've had the iron hurdles
LINE 374: taken out of the Green Park."
LINE 375: The exasperating man, however, preferred to make no comment, and to
LINE 376: proceed in smiling silence on his inexcusable way. The process of
LINE 377: "brushing on one side" very soon came into operation. Important Foreign
LINE 378: Office despatches were either submitted to the Queen so late that there
LINE 379: was no time to correct them, or they were not submitted to her at all;
LINE 380: or, having been submitted, and some passage in them being objected
LINE 381: to and an alteration suggested, they were after all sent off in their
LINE 382: original form. The Queen complained, the Prince complained: both
LINE 383: complained together. It was quite useless. Palmerston was most
LINE 384: apologetic--could not understand how it had occurred--must give the
LINE 385: clerks a wigging--certainly Her Majesty's wishes should be attended to,
LINE 386: and such a thing should never happen again. But, of course, it very soon
LINE 387: happened again, and the royal remonstrances redoubled. Victoria, her
LINE 388: partisan passions thoroughly aroused, imported into her protests a
LINE 389: personal vehemence which those of Albert lacked. Did Lord Palmerston
LINE 390: forget that she was Queen of England? How could she tolerate a state of
LINE 391: affairs in which despatches written in her name were sent abroad without
LINE 392: her approval or even her knowledge? What could be more derogatory to
LINE 393: her position than to be obliged to receive indignant letters from the
LINE 394: crowned heads to whom those despatches were addressed--letters which she
LINE 395: did not know how to answer, since she so thoroughly agreed with them?
LINE 396: She addressed herself to the Prime Minister. "No remonstrance has any
LINE 397: effect with Lord Palmerston," she said. "Lord Palmerston," she told him
LINE 398: on another occasion, "has as usual pretended not to have had time to
LINE 399: submit the draft to the Queen before he had sent it off." She summoned
LINE 400: Lord John to her presence, poured out her indignation, and afterwards,
LINE 401: on the advice of Albert, noted down what had passed in a memorandum: "I
LINE 402: said that I thought that Lord Palmerston often endangered the honour of
LINE 403: England by taking a very prejudiced and one-sided view of a question;
LINE 404: that his writings were always as bitter as gall and did great harm,
LINE 405: which Lord John entirely assented to, and that I often felt quite ill
LINE 406: from anxiety." Then she turned to her uncle. "The state of Germany,"
LINE 407: she wrote in a comprehensive and despairing review of the European
LINE 408: situation, "is dreadful, and one does feel quite ashamed about that once
LINE 409: really so peaceful and happy country. That there are still good people
LINE 410: there I am sure, but they allow themselves to be worked upon in a
LINE 411: frightful and shameful way. In France a crisis seems at hand. WHAT a
LINE 412: very bad figure we cut in this mediation! Really it is quite immoral,
LINE 413: with Ireland quivering in our grasp and ready to throw off her
LINE 414: allegiance at any moment, for us to force Austria to give up her lawful
LINE 415: possessions. What shall we say if Canada, Malta, etc., begin to trouble
LINE 416: us? It hurts me terribly." But what did Lord Palmerston care?
LINE 417: Lord John's position grew more and more irksome. He did not approve of
LINE 418: his colleague's treatment of the Queen. When he begged him to be more
LINE 419: careful, he was met with the reply that 28,000 despatches passed through
LINE 420: the Foreign Office in a single year, that, if every one of these were
LINE 421: to be subjected to the royal criticism, the delay would be most serious,
LINE 422: that, as it was, the waste of time and the worry involved in submitting
LINE 423: drafts to the meticulous examination of Prince Albert was almost too
LINE 424: much for an overworked Minister, and that, as a matter of fact, the
LINE 425: postponement of important decisions owing to this cause had already
LINE 426: produced very unpleasant diplomatic consequences. These excuses would
LINE 427: have impressed Lord John more favourably if he had not himself had to
LINE 428: suffer from a similar neglect. As often as not Palmerston failed to
LINE 429: communicate even to him the most important despatches. The Foreign
LINE 430: Secretary was becoming an almost independent power, acting on his own
LINE 431: initiative, and swaying the policy of England on his own responsibility.
LINE 432: On one occasion, in 1847, he had actually been upon the point of
LINE 433: threatening to break off diplomatic relations with France without
LINE 434: consulting either the Cabinet or the Prime Minister. And such incidents
LINE 435: were constantly recurring. When this became known to the Prince, he saw
LINE 436: that his opportunity had come. If he could only drive in to the utmost
LINE 437: the wedge between the two statesmen, if he could only secure the
LINE 438: alliance of Lord John, then the suppression or the removal of Lord
LINE 439: Palmerston would be almost certain to follow. He set about the business
LINE 440: with all the pertinacity of his nature. Both he and the Queen put every
LINE 441: kind of pressure upon the Prime Minister. They wrote, they harangued,
LINE 442: they relapsed into awful silence. It occurred to them that Lord
LINE 443: Clarendon, an important member of the Cabinet, would be a useful
LINE 444: channel for their griefs. They commanded him to dine at the Palace, and,
LINE 445: directly the meal was over, "the Queen," as he described it afterwards,
LINE 446: "exploded, and went with the utmost vehemence and bitterness into the
LINE 447: whole of Palmerston's conduct, all the effects produced all over the
LINE 448: world, and all her own feelings and sentiments about it." When she had
LINE 449: finished, the Prince took up the tale, with less excitement, but with
LINE 450: equal force. Lord Clarendon found himself in an awkward situation;
LINE 451: he disliked Palmerston's policy, but he was his colleague, and he
LINE 452: disapproved of the attitude of his royal hosts. In his opinion, they
LINE 453: were "wrong in wishing that courtiers rather than Ministers should
LINE 454: conduct the affairs of the country," and he thought that they "laboured
LINE 455: under the curious mistake that the Foreign Office was their peculiar
LINE 456: department, and that they had the right to control, if not to direct,
LINE 457: the foreign policy of England." He, therefore, with extreme politeness,
LINE 458: gave it to be understood that he would not commit himself in any
LINE 459: way. But Lord John, in reality, needed no pressure. Attacked by his
LINE 460: Sovereign, ignored by his Foreign Secretary, he led a miserable life.
LINE 461: With the advent of the dreadful Schleswig-Holstein question--the most
LINE 462: complex in the whole diplomatic history of Europe--his position,
LINE 463: crushed between the upper and the nether mill-stones, grew positively
LINE 464: unbearable. He became anxious above all things to get Palmerston out of
LINE 465: the Foreign Office. But then--supposing Palmerston refused to go?
LINE 466: In a memorandum made by the Prince, at about this time, of an interview
LINE 467: between himself, the Queen, and the Prime Minister, we catch a curious
LINE 468: glimpse of the states of mind of those three high personages--the
LINE 469: anxiety and irritation of Lord John, the vehement acrimony of Victoria,
LINE 470: and the reasonable animosity of Albert--drawn together, as it were,
LINE 471: under the shadow of an unseen Presence, the cause of that celestial
LINE 472: anger--the gay, portentous Palmerston. At one point in the conversation
LINE 473: Lord John observed that he believed the Foreign Secretary would consent
LINE 474: to a change of offices; Lord Palmerston, he said, realised that he had
LINE 475: lost the Queen's confidence--though only on public, and not on personal,
LINE 476: grounds. But on that, the Prince noted, "the Queen interrupted Lord John
LINE 477: by remarking that she distrusted him on PERSONAL grounds also, but I
LINE 478: remarked that Lord Palmerston had so far at least seen rightly; that he
LINE 479: had become disagreeable to the Queen, not on account of his person, but
LINE 480: of his political doings--to which the Queen assented." Then the Prince
LINE 481: suggested that there was a danger of the Cabinet breaking up, and of
LINE 482: Lord Palmerston returning to office as Prime Minister. But on that point
LINE 483: Lord John was reassuring: he "thought Lord Palmerston too old to do much
LINE 484: in the future (having passed his sixty-fifth year)." Eventually it was
LINE 485: decided that nothing could be done for the present, but that the UTMOST
LINE 486: SECRECY must be observed; and so the conclave ended.
LINE 487: At last, in 1850, deliverance seemed to be at hand. There were signs
LINE 488: that the public were growing weary of the alarums and excursions of
LINE 489: Palmerston's diplomacy; and when his support of Don Pacifico, a British
LINE 490: subject, in a quarrel with the Greek Government, seemed to be upon the
LINE 491: point of involving the country in a war not only with Greece but also
LINE 492: with France, and possibly with Russia into the bargain, a heavy cloud
LINE 493: of distrust and displeasure appeared to be gathering and about to burst
LINE 494: over his head. A motion directed against him in the House of Lords was
LINE 495: passed by a substantial majority. The question was next to be discussed
LINE 496: in the House of Commons, where another adverse vote was not improbable,
LINE 497: and would seal the doom of the Minister. Palmerston received the attack
LINE 498: with complete nonchalance, and then, at the last possible moment, he
LINE 499: struck. In a speech of over four hours, in which exposition, invective,
LINE 500: argument, declamation, plain talk and resounding eloquence were mingled
LINE 501: together with consummate art and extraordinary felicity, he annihilated
LINE 502: his enemies. The hostile motion was defeated, and Palmerston was once
LINE 503: more the hero of the hour. Simultaneously, Atropos herself conspired
LINE 504: to favour him. Sir Robert Peel was thrown from his horse and killed. By
LINE 505: this tragic chance, Palmerston saw the one rival great enough to cope
LINE 506: with him removed from his path. He judged--and judged rightly--that
LINE 507: he was the most popular man in England; and when Lord John revived the
LINE 508: project of his exchanging the Foreign Office for some other position in
LINE 509: the Cabinet, he absolutely refused to stir.
LINE 510: Great was the disappointment of Albert; great was the indignation
LINE 511: of Victoria. "The House of Commons," she wrote, "is becoming very
LINE 512: unmanageable and troublesome." The Prince, perceiving that Palmerston
LINE 513: was more firmly fixed in the saddle than ever, decided that something
LINE 514: drastic must be done. Five months before, the prescient Baron had
LINE 515: drawn up, in case of emergency, a memorandum, which had been carefully
LINE 516: docketed, and placed in a pigeon-hole ready to hand. The emergency had
LINE 517: now arisen, and the memorandum must be used. The Queen copied out the
LINE 518: words of Stockmar, and sent them to the Prime Minister, requesting him
LINE 519: to show her letter to Palmerston. "She thinks it right," she wrote, "in
LINE 520: order TO PREVENT ANY MISTAKE for the FUTURE, shortly to explain WHAT
LINE 521: IT IS SHE EXPECTS FROM HER FOREIGN SECRETARY. She requires: (1) That he
LINE 522: will distinctly state what he proposes in a given case, in order
LINE 523: that the Queen may know as distinctly to WHAT she has given her Royal
LINE 524: sanction; (2) Having ONCE GIVEN her sanction to a measure, that it be
LINE 525: not arbitrarily altered or modified by the Minister; such an act she
LINE 526: must consider as failing in sincerity towards the Crown, and justly to
LINE 527: be visited by the exercise of her Constitutional right of dismissing
LINE 528: that Minister." Lord John Russell did as he was bid, and forwarded the
LINE 529: Queen's letter to Lord Palmerston. This transaction, which was of grave
LINE 530: constitutional significance, was entirely unknown to the outside world.
LINE 531: If Palmerston had been a sensitive man, he would probably have resigned
LINE 532: on the receipt of the Queen's missive. But he was far from sensitive; he
LINE 533: loved power, and his power was greater than ever; an unerring instinct
LINE 534: told him that this was not the time to go. Nevertheless, he was
LINE 535: seriously perturbed. He understood at last that he was struggling with
LINE 536: a formidable adversary, whose skill and strength, unless they were
LINE 537: mollified, might do irreparable injury to his career. He therefore wrote
LINE 538: to Lord John, briefly acquiescing in the Queen's requirements--"I have
LINE 539: taken a copy of this memorandum of the Queen and will not fail to attend
LINE 540: to the directions which it contains"--and at the same time, he asked for
LINE 541: an interview with the Prince. Albert at once summoned him to the Palace,
LINE 542: and was astonished to observe, as he noted in a memorandum, that when
LINE 543: Palmerston entered the room "he was very much agitated, shook, and
LINE 544: had tears in his eyes, so as quite to move me, who never under any
LINE 545: circumstances had known him otherwise than with a bland smile on his
LINE 546: face." The old statesman was profuse in protestations and excuses; the
LINE 547: young one was coldly polite. At last, after a long and inconclusive
LINE 548: conversation, the Prince, drawing himself up, said that, in order to
LINE 549: give Lord Palmerston "an example of what the Queen wanted," he would
LINE 550: "ask him a question point-blank." Lord Palmerston waited in respectful
LINE 551: silence, while the Prince proceeded as follows: "You are aware that the
LINE 552: Queen has objected to the Protocol about Schleswig, and of the grounds
LINE 553: on which she has done so. Her opinion has been overruled, the Protocol
LINE 554: stating the desire of the Great Powers to see the integrity of the
LINE 555: Danish monarchy preserved has been signed, and upon this the King of
LINE 556: Denmark has invaded Schleswig, where the war is raging. If Holstein is
LINE 557: attacked also, which is likely, the Germans will not be restrained from
LINE 558: flying to her assistance; Russia has menaced to interfere with arms,
LINE 559: if the Schleswigers are successful. What will you do, if this emergency
LINE 560: arises (provoking most likely an European war), and which will arise
LINE 561: very probably when we shall be at Balmoral and Lord John in another
LINE 562: part of Scotland? The Queen expects from your foresight that you have
LINE 563: contemplated this possibility, and requires a categorical answer as
LINE 564: to what you would do in the event supposed." Strangely enough, to this
LINE 565: pointblank question, the Foreign Secretary appeared to be unable to
LINE 566: reply. The whole matter, he said, was extremely complicated, and the
LINE 567: contingencies mentioned by His Royal Highness were very unlikely to
LINE 568: arise. The Prince persisted; but it was useless; for a full hour he
LINE 569: struggled to extract a categorical answer, until at length Palmerston
LINE 570: bowed himself out of the room. Albert threw up his hands in shocked
LINE 571: amazement: what could one do with such a man?
LINE 572: What indeed? For, in spite of all his apologies and all his promises,
LINE 573: within a few weeks the incorrigible reprobate was at his tricks again.
LINE 574: The Austrian General Haynau, notorious as a rigorous suppressor of
LINE 575: rebellion in Hungary and Italy, and in particular as a flogger of women,
LINE 576: came to England and took it into his head to pay a visit to Messrs.
LINE 577: Barclay and Perkins's brewery. The features of "General Hyena," as he
LINE 578: was everywhere called--his grim thin face, his enormous pepper-and-salt
LINE 579: moustaches--had gained a horrid celebrity; and it so happened that among
LINE 580: the clerks at the brewery there was a refugee from Vienna, who had
LINE 581: given his fellow-workers a first-hand account of the General's
LINE 582: characteristics. The Austrian Ambassador, scenting danger, begged his
LINE 583: friend not to appear in public, or, if he must do so, to cut off his
LINE 584: moustaches first. But the General would take no advice. He went to the
LINE 585: brewery, was immediately recognised, surrounded by a crowd of angry
LINE 586: draymen, pushed about, shouted at, punched in the ribs, and pulled by
LINE 587: the moustaches until, bolting down an alley with the mob at his heels
LINE 588: brandishing brooms and roaring "Hyena!" he managed to take refuge in
LINE 589: a public house, whence he was removed under the protection of several
LINE 590: policemen. The Austrian Government was angry and demanded explanations.
LINE 591: Palmerston, who, of course, was privately delighted by the incident,
LINE 592: replied regretting what had occurred, but adding that in his opinion
LINE 593: the General had "evinced a want of propriety in coming to England at
LINE 594: the present moment;" and he delivered his note to the Ambassador without
LINE 595: having previously submitted it to the Queen or to the Prime Minister.
LINE 596: Naturally, when this was discovered, there was a serious storm. The
LINE 597: Prince was especially indignant; the conduct of the draymen he regarded,
LINE 598: with disgust and alarm, as "a slight foretaste of what an unregulated
LINE 599: mass of illiterate people is capable;" and Palmerston was requested by
LINE 600: Lord John to withdraw his note, and to substitute for it another from
LINE 601: which all censure of the General had been omitted. On this the Foreign
LINE 602: Secretary threatened resignation, but the Prime Minister was firm. For a
LINE 603: moment the royal hopes rose high, only to be dashed to the ground again
LINE 604: by the cruel compliance of the enemy. Palmerston, suddenly lamblike,
LINE 605: agreed to everything; the note was withdrawn and altered, and peace was
LINE 606: patched up once more.
LINE 607: It lasted for a year, and then, in October, 1851, the arrival of Kossuth
LINE 608: in England brought on another crisis. Palmerston's desire to receive the
LINE 609: Hungarian patriot at his house in London was vetoed by Lord John; once
LINE 610: more there was a sharp struggle; once more Palmerston, after threatening
LINE 611: resignation, yielded. But still the insubordinate man could not keep
LINE 612: quiet. A few weeks later a deputation of Radicals from Finsbury and
LINE 613: Islington waited on him at the Foreign Office and presented him with an
LINE 614: address, in which the Emperors of Austria and Russia were stigmatised as
LINE 615: "odious and detestable assassins" and "merciless tyrants and despots."
LINE 616: The Foreign Secretary in his reply, while mildly deprecating these
LINE 617: expressions, allowed his real sentiments to appear with a most
LINE 618: undiplomatic insouciance There was an immediate scandal, and the Court
LINE 619: flowed over with rage and vituperation. "I think," said the Baron, "the
LINE 620: man has been for some time insane." Victoria, in an agitated letter,
LINE 621: urged Lord John to assert his authority. But Lord John perceived that on
LINE 622: this matter the Foreign Secretary had the support of public opinion, and
LINE 623: he judged it wiser to bide his time.
LINE 624: He had not long to wait. The culmination of the long series of
LINE 625: conflicts, threats, and exacerbations came before the year was out. On
LINE 626: December 2, Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat took place in Paris; and on
LINE 627: the following day Palmerston, without consulting anybody, expressed in a
LINE 628: conversation with the French Ambassador his approval of Napoleon's act.
LINE 629: Two days later, he was instructed by the Prime Minister, in accordance
LINE 630: with a letter from the Queen, that it was the policy of the English
LINE 631: Government to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality towards the
LINE 632: affairs of France. Nevertheless, in an official despatch to the British
LINE 633: Ambassador in Paris, he repeated the approval of the coup d'etat which
LINE 634: he had already given verbally to the French Ambassador in London. This
LINE 635: despatch was submitted neither to the Queen nor to the Prime Minister.
LINE 636: Lord John's patience, as he himself said, "was drained to the last
LINE 637: drop." He dismissed Lord Palmerston.
LINE 638: Victoria was in ecstasies; and Albert knew that the triumph was his even
LINE 639: more than Lord John's. It was his wish that Lord Granville, a young man
LINE 640: whom he believed to be pliant to his influence, should be Palmerston's
LINE 641: successor; and Lord Granville was appointed. Henceforward, it seemed
LINE 642: that the Prince would have his way in foreign affairs. After years of
LINE 643: struggle and mortification, success greeted him on every hand. In his
LINE 644: family, he was an adored master; in the country, the Great Exhibition
LINE 645: had brought him respect and glory; and now in the secret seats of power
LINE 646: he had gained a new supremacy. He had wrestled with the terrible Lord
LINE 647: Palmerston, the embodiment of all that was most hostile to him in the
LINE 648: spirit of England, and his redoubtable opponent had been overthrown. Was
LINE 649: England herself at his feet? It might be so; and yet... it is said that
LINE 650: the sons of England have a certain tiresome quality: they never know
LINE 651: when they are beaten. It was odd, but Palmerston was positively still
LINE 652: jaunty. Was it possible? Could he believe, in his blind arrogance,
LINE 653: that even his ignominious dismissal from office was something that could
LINE 654: be brushed aside?
LINE 655: III
LINE 656: The Prince's triumph was short-lived. A few weeks later, owing to
LINE 657: Palmerston's influence, the Government was defeated in the House, and
LINE 658: Lord John resigned. Then, after a short interval, a coalition between
LINE 659: the Whigs and the followers of Peel came into power, under the
LINE 660: premiership of Lord Aberdeen. Once more, Palmerston was in the Cabinet.
LINE 661: It was true that he did not return to the Foreign Office; that was
LINE 662: something to the good; in the Home Department it might be hoped that
LINE 663: his activities would be less dangerous and disagreeable. But the Foreign
LINE 664: Secretary was no longer the complacent Granville; and in Lord Clarendon
LINE 665: the Prince knew that he had a Minister to deal with, who, discreet and
LINE 666: courteous as he was, had a mind of his own. These changes, however, were
LINE 667: merely the preliminaries of a far more serious development.
LINE 668: Events, on every side, were moving towards a catastrophe. Suddenly the
LINE 669: nation found itself under the awful shadow of imminent war. For several
LINE 670: months, amid the shifting mysteries of diplomacy and the perplexed
LINE 671: agitations of politics, the issue grew more doubtful and more dark,
LINE 672: while the national temper was strained to the breaking-point. At the
LINE 673: very crisis of the long and ominous negotiations, it was announced that
LINE 674: Lord Palmerston had resigned. Then the pent-up fury of the people burst
LINE 675: forth. They had felt that in the terrible complexity of events they
LINE 676: were being guided by weak and embarrassed counsels; but they had been
LINE 677: reassured by the knowledge that at the centre of power there was one man
LINE 678: with strength, with courage, with determination, in whom they could put
LINE 679: their trust. They now learnt that that man was no longer among their
LINE 680: leaders. Why? In their rage, anxiety, and nervous exhaustion, they
LINE 681: looked round desperately for some hidden and horrible explanation of
LINE 682: what had occurred. They suspected plots, they smelt treachery in the
LINE 683: air. It was easy to guess the object upon which their frenzy would
LINE 684: vent itself. Was there not a foreigner in the highest of high places, a
LINE 685: foreigner whose hostility to their own adored champion was unrelenting
LINE 686: and unconcealed? The moment that Palmerston's resignation was known,
LINE 687: there was a universal outcry and an extraordinary tempest of anger and
LINE 688: hatred burst, with unparalleled violence, upon the head of the Prince.
LINE 689: It was everywhere asserted and believed that the Queen's husband was a
LINE 690: traitor to the country, that he was a tool of the Russian Court, that
LINE 691: in obedience to Russian influences he had forced Palmerston out of the
LINE 692: Government, and that he was directing the foreign policy of England in
LINE 693: the interests of England's enemies. For many weeks these accusations
LINE 694: filled the whole of the press; repeated at public meetings, elaborated
LINE 695: in private talk, they flew over the country, growing every moment more
LINE 696: extreme and more improbable. While respectable newspapers thundered out
LINE 697: their grave invectives, halfpenny broadsides, hawked through the streets
LINE 698: of London, re-echoed in doggerel vulgarity the same sentiments and the
LINE 699: same suspicions(*). At last the wildest rumours began to spread.
LINE 700: (*)"The Turkish war both far and near
LINE 701: Has played the very deuce then,
LINE 702: And little Al, the royal pal,
LINE 703: They say has turned a Russian;
LINE 704: Old Aberdeen, as may be seen,
LINE 705: Looks woeful pale and yellow,
LINE 706: And Old John Bull had his belly full
LINE 707: Of dirty Russian tallow."
LINE 708: Chorus:
LINE 709: "We'll send him home and make him groan,
LINE 710: Oh, Al! you've played the deuce then;
LINE 711: The German lad has acted sad
LINE 712: And turned tail with the Russians."
LINE 713: * * * * *
LINE 714: "Last Monday night, all in a fright,
LINE 715: Al out of bed did tumble.
LINE 716: The German lad was raving mad,
LINE 717: How he did groan and grumble!
LINE 718: He cried to Vic, 'I've cut my stick:
LINE 719: To St. Petersburg go right slap.'
LINE 720: When Vic, 'tis said, jumped out of bed,
LINE 721: And wopped him with her night-cap."
LINE 722: From Lovely Albert! a broadside preserved at the British Museum.
LINE 723: In January, 1854, it was whispered that the Prince had been seized, that
LINE 724: he had been found guilty of high treason, that he was to be committed
LINE 725: to the Tower. The Queen herself, some declared, had been arrested,
LINE 726: and large crowds actually collected round the Tower to watch the
LINE 727: incarceration of the royal miscreants.(*)
LINE 728: (*)"You Jolly Turks, now go to work,
LINE 729: And show the Bear your power.
LINE 730: It is rumoured over Britain's isle
LINE 731: That A------ is in the Tower;
LINE 732: The postmen some suspicion had,
LINE 733: And opened the two letters,
LINE 734: 'Twas a pity sad the German lad
LINE 735: Should not have known much better!"
LINE 736: Lovely Albert!
LINE 737: These fantastic hallucinations, the result of the fevered atmosphere of
LINE 738: approaching war, were devoid of any basis in actual fact. Palmerston's
LINE 739: resignation had been in all probability totally disconnected with
LINE 740: foreign policy; it had certainly been entirely spontaneous, and had
LINE 741: surprised the Court as much as the nation. Nor had Albert's influence
LINE 742: been used in any way to favour the interests of Russia. As often happens
LINE 743: in such cases, the Government had been swinging backwards and forwards
LINE 744: between two incompatible policies--that of non-interference and that of
LINE 745: threats supported by force--either of which, if consistently followed,
LINE 746: might well have had a successful and peaceful issue, but which,
LINE 747: mingled together, could only lead to war. Albert, with characteristic
LINE 748: scrupulosity, attempted to thread his way through the complicated
LINE 749: labyrinth of European diplomacy, and eventually was lost in the
LINE 750: maze. But so was the whole of the Cabinet; and, when war came, his
LINE 751: anti-Russian feelings were quite as vehement as those of the most
LINE 752: bellicose of Englishmen.
LINE 753: Nevertheless, though the specific charges levelled against the Prince
LINE 754: were without foundation, there were underlying elements in the situation
LINE 755: which explained, if they did not justify, the popular state of mind. It
LINE 756: was true that the Queen's husband was a foreigner, who had been brought
LINE 757: up in a foreign Court, was impregnated with foreign ideas, and was
LINE 758: closely related to a multitude of foreign princes. Clearly this, though
LINE 759: perhaps an unavoidable, was an undesirable, state of affairs; nor
LINE 760: were the objections to it merely theoretical; it had in fact produced
LINE 761: unpleasant consequences of a serious kind. The Prince's German
LINE 762: proclivities were perpetually lamented by English Ministers; Lord
LINE 763: Palmerston, Lord Clarendon, Lord Aberdeen, all told the same tale; and
LINE 764: it was constantly necessary, in grave questions of national policy, to
LINE 765: combat the prepossessions of a Court in which German views and German
LINE 766: sentiments held a disproportionate place. As for Palmerston, his
LINE 767: language on this topic was apt to be unbridled. At the height of his
LINE 768: annoyance over his resignation, he roundly declared that he had been
LINE 769: made a victim to foreign intrigue. He afterwards toned down this
LINE 770: accusation; but the mere fact that such a suggestion from such a quarter
LINE 771: was possible at all showed to what unfortunate consequences Albert's
LINE 772: foreign birth and foreign upbringing might lead.
LINE 773: But this was not all. A constitutional question of the most profound
LINE 774: importance was raised by the position of the Prince in England. His
LINE 775: presence gave a new prominence to an old problem--the precise definition
LINE 776: of the functions and the powers of the Crown. Those functions and powers
LINE 777: had become, in effect, his; and what sort of use was he making of them?
LINE 778: His views as to the place of the Crown in the Constitution are easily
LINE 779: ascertainable; for they were Stockmar's; and it happens that we possess
LINE 780: a detailed account of Stockmar's opinions upon the subject in a long
LINE 781: letter addressed by him to the Prince at the time of this very crisis,
LINE 782: just before the outbreak of the Crimean War. Constitutional Monarchy,
LINE 783: according to the Baron, had suffered an eclipse since the passing of
LINE 784: the Reform Bill. It was now "constantly in danger of becoming a pure
LINE 785: Ministerial Government." The old race of Tories, who "had a direct
LINE 786: interest in upholding the prerogatives of the Crown," had died out;
LINE 787: and the Whigs were "nothing but partly conscious, partly unconscious
LINE 788: Republicans, who stand in the same relation to the Throne as the wolf
LINE 789: does to the lamb." There was a rule that it was unconstitutional to
LINE 790: introduce "the name and person of the irresponsible Sovereign"
LINE 791: into parliamentary debates on constitutional matters; this was "a
LINE 792: constitutional fiction, which, although undoubtedly of old standing,
LINE 793: was fraught with danger"; and the Baron warned the Prince that "if the
LINE 794: English Crown permit a Whig Ministry to follow this rule in practice,
LINE 795: without exception, you must not wonder if in a little time you find the
LINE 796: majority of the people impressed with the belief that the King, in the
LINE 797: view of the law, is nothing but a mandarin figure, which has to nod
LINE 798: its head in assent, or shake it in denial, as his Minister pleases."
LINE 799: To prevent this from happening, it was of extreme importance, said
LINE 800: the Baron, "that no opportunity should be let slip of vindicating the
LINE 801: legitimate position of the Crown." "And this is not hard to do," he
LINE 802: added, "and can never embarrass a Minister where such straightforward
LINE 803: loyal personages as the Queen and the Prince are concerned." In his
LINE 804: opinion, the very lowest claim of the Royal Prerogative should include
LINE 805: "a right on the part of the King to be the permanent President of his
LINE 806: Ministerial Council." The Sovereign ought to be "in the position of
LINE 807: a permanent Premier, who takes rank above the temporary head of the
LINE 808: Cabinet, and in matters of discipline exercises supreme authority." The
LINE 809: Sovereign "may even take a part in the initiation and the maturing of
LINE 810: the Government measures; for it would be unreasonable to expect that a
LINE 811: king, himself as able, as accomplished, and as patriotic as the best of
LINE 812: his Ministers, should be prevented from making use of these qualities
LINE 813: at the deliberations of his Council." "The judicious exercise of this
LINE 814: right," concluded the Baron, "which certainly requires a master mind,
LINE 815: would not only be the best guarantee for Constitutional Monarchy, but
LINE 816: would raise it to a height of power, stability, and symmetry, which has
LINE 817: never been attained."
LINE 818: Now it may be that this reading of the Constitution is a possible one,
LINE 819: though indeed it is hard to see how it can be made compatible with the
LINE 820: fundamental doctrine of ministerial responsibility. William III presided
LINE 821: over his Council, and he was a constitutional monarch; and it seems
LINE 822: that Stockmar had in his mind a conception of the Crown which would have
LINE 823: given it a place in the Constitution analogous to that which it filled
LINE 824: at the time of William III. But it is clear that such a theory, which
LINE 825: would invest the Crown with more power than it possessed even under
LINE 826: George III, runs counter to the whole development of English public life
LINE 827: since the Revolution; and the fact that it was held by Stockmar, and
LINE 828: instilled by him into Albert, was of very serious importance. For there
LINE 829: was good reason to believe not only that these doctrines were held by
LINE 830: Albert in theory, but that he was making a deliberate and sustained
LINE 831: attempt to give them practical validity. The history of the struggle
LINE 832: between the Crown and Palmerston provided startling evidence that this
LINE 833: was the case. That struggle reached its culmination when, in Stockmar's
LINE 834: memorandum of 1850, the Queen asserted her "constitutional right"
LINE 835: to dismiss the Foreign Secretary if he altered a despatch which had
LINE 836: received her sanction. The memorandum was, in fact, a plain declaration
LINE 837: that the Crown intended to act independently of the Prime Minister.
LINE 838: Lord John Russell, anxious at all costs to strengthen himself against
LINE 839: Palmerston, accepted the memorandum, and thereby implicitly allowed the
LINE 840: claim of the Crown. More than that; after the dismissal of Palmerston,
LINE 841: among the grounds on which Lord John justified that dismissal in the
LINE 842: House of Commons he gave a prominent place to the memorandum of 1850. It
LINE 843: became apparent that the displeasure of the Sovereign might be a reason
LINE 844: for the removal of a powerful and popular Minister. It seemed indeed
LINE 845: as if, under the guidance of Stockmar and Albert, the "Constitutional
LINE 846: Monarchy" might in very truth be rising "to a height of power,
LINE 847: stability, and symmetry, which had never been attained."
LINE 848: But this new development in the position of the Crown, grave as it
LINE 849: was in itself, was rendered peculiarly disquieting by the unusual
LINE 850: circumstances which surrounded it. For the functions of the Crown were
LINE 851: now, in effect, being exercised by a person unknown to the Constitution,
LINE 852: who wielded over the Sovereign an undefined and unbounded influence. The
LINE 853: fact that this person was the Sovereign's husband, while it explained
LINE 854: his influence and even made it inevitable, by no means diminished its
LINE 855: strange and momentous import. An ambiguous, prepotent figure had come
LINE 856: to disturb the ancient, subtle, and jealously guarded balance of the
LINE 857: English Constitution. Such had been the unexpected outcome of the
LINE 858: tentative and fainthearted opening of Albert's political life. He
LINE 859: himself made no attempt to minimise either the multiplicity or the
LINE 860: significance of the functions he performed. He considered that it was
LINE 861: his duty, he told the Duke of Wellington in 1850, to "sink his
LINE 862: OWN INDIVIDUAL existence in that of his wife--assume no separate
LINE 863: responsibility before the public, but make his position entirely a part
LINE 864: of hers--fill up every gap which, as a woman, she would naturally leave
LINE 865: in the exercise of her regal functions--continually and anxiously watch
LINE 866: every part of the public business, in order to be able to advise and
LINE 867: assist her at any moment in any of the multifarious and difficult
LINE 868: questions or duties brought before her, sometimes international,
LINE 869: sometimes political, or social, or personal. As the natural head of her
LINE 870: family, superintendent of her household, manager of her private affairs,
LINE 871: sole CONFIDENTIAL adviser in politics, and only assistant in her
LINE 872: communications with the officers of the Government, he is, besides,
LINE 873: the husband of the Queen, the tutor of the royal children, the private
LINE 874: secretary of the Sovereign, and her permanent minister."
LINE 875: Stockmar's pupil had assuredly gone far and learnt well. Stockmar's
LINE 876: pupil!--precisely; the public, painfully aware of Albert's predominance,
LINE 877: had grown, too, uneasily conscious that Victoria's master had a master
LINE 878: of his own. Deep in the darkness the Baron loomed. Another foreigner!
LINE 879: Decidedly, there were elements in the situation which went far to
LINE 880: justify the popular alarm. A foreign Baron controlled a foreign Prince,
LINE 881: and the foreign Prince controlled the Crown of England. And the Crown
LINE 882: itself was creeping forward ominously; and when, from under its shadow,
LINE 883: the Baron and the Prince had frowned, a great Minister, beloved of the
LINE 884: people, had fallen. Where was all this to end?
LINE 885: Within a few weeks Palmerston withdrew his resignation, and the public
LINE 886: frenzy subsided as quickly as it had arisen. When Parliament met, the
LINE 887: leaders of both the parties in both the Houses made speeches in favour
LINE 888: of the Prince, asserting his unimpeachable loyalty to the country and
LINE 889: vindicating his right to advise the Sovereign in all matters of State.
LINE 890: Victoria was delighted. "The position of my beloved lord and master,"
LINE 891: she told the Baron, "has been defined for once amid all and his merits
LINE 892: have been acknowledged on all sides most duly. There was an immense
LINE 893: concourse of people assembled when we went to the House of Lords, and
LINE 894: the people were very friendly." Immediately afterwards, the country
LINE 895: finally plunged into the Crimean War. In the struggle that followed,
LINE 896: Albert's patriotism was put beyond a doubt, and the animosities of
LINE 897: the past were forgotten. But the war had another consequence, less
LINE 898: gratifying to the royal couple: it crowned the ambition of Lord
LINE 899: Palmerston. In 1855, the man who five years before had been pronounced
LINE 900: by Lord John Russell to be "too old to do much in the future," became
LINE 901: Prime Minister of England, and, with one short interval, remained in
LINE 902: that position for ten years.
