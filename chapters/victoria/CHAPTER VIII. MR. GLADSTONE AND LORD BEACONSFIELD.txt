LINE 1: I
LINE 2: Lord Palmerston's laugh--a queer metallic "Ha! ha! ha!" with
LINE 3: reverberations in it from the days of Pitt and the Congress of
LINE 4: Vienna--was heard no more in Piccadilly; Lord John Russell dwindled into
LINE 5: senility; Lord Derby tottered from the stage. A new scene opened; and
LINE 6: new protagonists--Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli--struggled together
LINE 7: in the limelight. Victoria, from her post of vantage, watched these
LINE 8: developments with that passionate and personal interest which she
LINE 9: invariably imported into politics. Her prepossessions were of an
LINE 10: unexpected kind. Mr. Gladstone had been the disciple of her revered
LINE 11: Peel, and had won the approval of Albert; Mr. Disraeli had hounded Sir
LINE 12: Robert to his fall with hideous virulence, and the Prince had pronounced
LINE 13: that he "had not one single element of a gentleman in his composition."
LINE 14: Yet she regarded Mr. Gladstone with a distrust and dislike which
LINE 15: steadily deepened, while upon his rival she lavished an abundance of
LINE 16: confidence, esteem, and affection such as Lord Melbourne himself had
LINE 17: hardly known.
LINE 18: Her attitude towards the Tory Minister had suddenly changed when
LINE 19: she found that he alone among public men had divined her feelings at
LINE 20: Albert's death. Of the others she might have said "they pity me and not
LINE 21: my grief;" but Mr. Disraeli had understood; and all his condolences
LINE 22: had taken the form of reverential eulogies of the departed. The Queen
LINE 23: declared that he was "the only person who appreciated the Prince."
LINE 24: She began to show him special favour; gave him and his wife two of the
LINE 25: coveted seats in St. George's Chapel at the Prince of Wales's wedding,
LINE 26: and invited him to stay a night at Windsor. When the grant for the
LINE 27: Albert Memorial came before the House of Commons, Disraeli, as leader of
LINE 28: the Opposition, eloquently supported the project. He was rewarded by
LINE 29: a copy of the Prince's speeches, bound in white morocco, with an
LINE 30: inscription in the royal hand. In his letter of thanks he "ventured
LINE 31: to touch upon a sacred theme," and, in a strain which re-echoed with
LINE 32: masterly fidelity the sentiments of his correspondent, dwelt at length
LINE 33: upon the absolute perfection of Albert. "The Prince," he said, "is the
LINE 34: only person whom Mr. Disraeli has ever known who realised the Ideal.
LINE 35: None with whom he is acquainted have ever approached it. There was in
LINE 36: him a union of the manly grace and sublime simplicity, of chivalry with
LINE 37: the intellectual splendour of the Attic Academe. The only character in
LINE 38: English history that would, in some respects, draw near to him is Sir
LINE 39: Philip Sidney: the same high tone, the same universal accomplishments,
LINE 40: the same blended tenderness and vigour, the same rare combination of
LINE 41: romantic energy and classic repose." As for his own acquaintance
LINE 42: with the Prince, it had been, he said, "one of the most satisfactory
LINE 43: incidents of his life: full of refined and beautiful memories, and
LINE 44: exercising, as he hopes, over his remaining existence, a soothing
LINE 45: and exalting influence." Victoria was much affected by "the depth and
LINE 46: delicacy of these touches," and henceforward Disraeli's place in her
LINE 47: affections was assured. When, in 1866, the Conservatives came into
LINE 48: office, Disraeli's position as Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader
LINE 49: of the House necessarily brought him into a closer relation with the
LINE 50: Sovereign. Two years later Lord Derby resigned, and Victoria, with
LINE 51: intense delight and peculiar graciousness, welcomed Disraeli as her
LINE 52: First Minister.
LINE 53: But only for nine agitated months did he remain in power. The Ministry,
LINE 54: in a minority in the Commons, was swept out of existence by a general
LINE 55: election. Yet by the end of that short period the ties which bound
LINE 56: together the Queen and her Premier had grown far stronger than ever
LINE 57: before; the relationship between them was now no longer merely that
LINE 58: between a grateful mistress and a devoted servant: they were friends.
LINE 59: His official letters, in which the personal element had always been
LINE 60: perceptible, developed into racy records of political news and social
LINE 61: gossip, written, as Lord Clarendon said, "in his best novel style."
LINE 62: Victoria was delighted; she had never, she declared, had such letters
LINE 63: in her life, and had never before known EVERYTHING. In return, she sent
LINE 64: him, when the spring came, several bunches of flowers, picked by her own
LINE 65: hands. He despatched to her a set of his novels, for which, she said,
LINE 66: she was "most grateful, and which she values much." She herself had
LINE 67: lately published her "Leaves from the Journal of our Life in the
LINE 68: Highlands," and it was observed that the Prime Minister, in conversing
LINE 69: with Her Majesty at this period, constantly used the words "we authors,
LINE 70: ma'am." Upon political questions, she was his staunch supporter. "Really
LINE 71: there never was such conduct as that of the Opposition," she wrote. And
LINE 72: when the Government was defeated in the House she was "really shocked at
LINE 73: the way in which the House of Commons go on; they really bring discredit
LINE 74: on Constitutional Government." She dreaded the prospect of a change;
LINE 75: she feared that if the Liberals insisted upon disestablishing the Irish
LINE 76: Church, her Coronation Oath might stand in the way. But a change there
LINE 77: had to be, and Victoria vainly tried to console herself for the loss of
LINE 78: her favourite Minister by bestowing a peerage upon Mrs. Disraeli.
LINE 79: Mr. Gladstone was in his shirt-sleeves at Hawarden, cutting down a
LINE 80: tree, when the royal message was brought to him. "Very significant,"
LINE 81: he remarked, when he had read the letter, and went on cutting down his
LINE 82: tree. His secret thoughts on the occasion were more explicit, and were
LINE 83: committed to his diary. "The Almighty," he wrote, "seems to sustain and
LINE 84: spare me for some purpose of His own, deeply unworthy as I know myself
LINE 85: to be. Glory be to His name."
LINE 86: The Queen, however, did not share her new Minister's view of the
LINE 87: Almighty's intentions. She could not believe that there was any divine
LINE 88: purpose to be detected in the programme of sweeping changes which
LINE 89: Mr. Gladstone was determined to carry out. But what could she do? Mr.
LINE 90: Gladstone, with his daemonic energy and his powerful majority in
LINE 91: the House of Commons, was irresistible; and for five years (1869-74)
LINE 92: Victoria found herself condemned to live in an agitating atmosphere
LINE 93: of interminable reform--reform in the Irish Church and the Irish land
LINE 94: system, reform in education, reform in parliamentary elections,
LINE 95: reform in the organisation of the Army and the Navy, reform in the
LINE 96: administration of justice. She disapproved, she struggled, she grew very
LINE 97: angry; she felt that if Albert had been living things would never have
LINE 98: happened so; but her protests and her complaints were alike unavailing.
LINE 99: The mere effort of grappling with the mass of documents which poured
LINE 100: in upon her in an ever-growing flood was terribly exhausting. When the
LINE 101: draft of the lengthy and intricate Irish Church Bill came before her,
LINE 102: accompanied by an explanatory letter from Mr. Gladstone covering a dozen
LINE 103: closely-written quarto pages, she almost despaired. She turned from
LINE 104: the Bill to the explanation, and from the explanation back again to the
LINE 105: Bill, and she could not decide which was the most confusing. But she had
LINE 106: to do her duty: she had not only to read, but to make notes. At last
LINE 107: she handed the whole heap of papers to Mr. Martin, who happened to be
LINE 108: staying at Osborne, and requested him to make a precis of them. When
LINE 109: he had done so, her disapproval of the measure became more marked than
LINE 110: ever; but, such was the strength of the Government, she actually found
LINE 111: herself obliged to urge moderation upon the Opposition, lest worse
LINE 112: should ensue.
LINE 113: In the midst of this crisis, when the future of the Irish Church was
LINE 114: hanging in the balance, Victoria's attention was drawn to another
LINE 115: proposed reform. It was suggested that the sailors in the Navy should
LINE 116: henceforward be allowed to wear beards. "Has Mr. Childers ascertained
LINE 117: anything on the subject of the beards?" the Queen wrote anxiously to the
LINE 118: First Lord of the Admiralty. On the whole, Her Majesty was in favour
LINE 119: of the change. "Her own personal feeling," she wrote, "would be for the
LINE 120: beards without the moustaches, as the latter have rather a soldierlike
LINE 121: appearance; but then the object in view would not be obtained, viz.
LINE 122: to prevent the necessity of shaving. Therefore it had better be as
LINE 123: proposed, the entire beard, only it should be kept short and very
LINE 124: clean." After thinking over the question for another week, the Queen
LINE 125: wrote a final letter. She wished, she said, "to make one additional
LINE 126: observation respecting the beards, viz. that on no account should
LINE 127: moustaches be allowed without beards. That must be clearly understood."
LINE 128: Changes in the Navy might be tolerated; to lay hands upon the Army was a
LINE 129: more serious matter. From time immemorial there had been a particularly
LINE 130: close connection between the Army and the Crown; and Albert had devoted
LINE 131: even more time and attention to the details of military business than
LINE 132: to the processes of fresco-painting or the planning of sanitary cottages
LINE 133: for the deserving poor. But now there was to be a great alteration: Mr.
LINE 134: Gladstone's fiat had gone forth, and the Commander-in-Chief was to
LINE 135: be removed from his direct dependence upon the Sovereign, and made
LINE 136: subordinate to Parliament and the Secretary of State for War. Of all the
LINE 137: liberal reforms this was the one which aroused the bitterest resentment
LINE 138: in Victoria. She considered that the change was an attack upon her
LINE 139: personal position--almost an attack upon the personal position of
LINE 140: Albert. But she was helpless, and the Prime Minister had his way.
LINE 141: When she heard that the dreadful man had yet another reform in
LINE 142: contemplation--that he was about to abolish the purchase of military
LINE 143: commissions--she could only feel that it was just what might have been
LINE 144: expected. For a moment she hoped that the House of Lords would come to
LINE 145: the rescue; the Peers opposed the change with unexpected vigour; but Mr.
LINE 146: Gladstone, more conscious than ever of the support of the Almighty, was
LINE 147: ready with an ingenious device. The purchase of commissions had been
LINE 148: originally allowed by Royal Warrant; it should now be disallowed by the
LINE 149: same agency. Victoria was faced by a curious dilemma: she abominated the
LINE 150: abolition of purchase; but she was asked to abolish it by an exercise of
LINE 151: sovereign power which was very much to her taste. She did not hesitate
LINE 152: for long; and when the Cabinet, in a formal minute, advised her to sign
LINE 153: the Warrant, she did so with a good grace.
LINE 154: Unacceptable as Mr. Gladstone's policy was, there was something else
LINE 155: about him which was even more displeasing to Victoria. She disliked his
LINE 156: personal demeanour towards herself. It was not that Mr. Gladstone,
LINE 157: in his intercourse with her, was in any degree lacking in courtesy or
LINE 158: respect. On the contrary, an extraordinary reverence impregnated
LINE 159: his manner, both in his conversation and his correspondence with the
LINE 160: Sovereign. Indeed, with that deep and passionate conservatism which, to
LINE 161: the very end of his incredible career, gave such an unexpected colouring
LINE 162: to his inexplicable character, Mr. Gladstone viewed Victoria through a
LINE 163: haze of awe which was almost religious--as a sacrosanct embodiment of
LINE 164: venerable traditions--a vital element in the British Constitution--a
LINE 165: Queen by Act of Parliament. But unfortunately the lady did not
LINE 166: appreciate the compliment. The well-known complaint--"He speaks to me
LINE 167: as if I were a public meeting-" whether authentic or no--and the turn
LINE 168: of the sentence is surely a little too epigrammatic to be genuinely
LINE 169: Victorian--undoubtedly expresses the essential element of her antipathy.
LINE 170: She had no objection to being considered as an institution; she was one,
LINE 171: and she knew it. But she was a woman too, and to be considered ONLY as
LINE 172: an institution--that was unbearable. And thus all Mr. Gladstone's zeal
LINE 173: and devotion, his ceremonious phrases, his low bows, his punctilious
LINE 174: correctitudes, were utterly wasted; and when, in the excess of his
LINE 175: loyalty, he went further, and imputed to the object of his veneration,
LINE 176: with obsequious blindness, the subtlety of intellect, the wide reading,
LINE 177: the grave enthusiasm, which he himself possessed, the misunderstanding
LINE 178: became complete. The discordance between the actual Victoria and this
LINE 179: strange Divinity made in Mr. Gladstone's image produced disastrous
LINE 180: results. Her discomfort and dislike turned at last into positive
LINE 181: animosity, and, though her manners continued to be perfect, she
LINE 182: never for a moment unbent; while he on his side was overcome with
LINE 183: disappointment, perplexity, and mortification.
LINE 184: Yet his fidelity remained unshaken. When the Cabinet met, the Prime
LINE 185: Minister, filled with his beatific vision, would open the proceedings by
LINE 186: reading aloud the letters which he had received from the Queen upon the
LINE 187: questions of the hour. The assembly sat in absolute silence while,
LINE 188: one after another, the royal missives, with their emphases, their
LINE 189: ejaculations, and their grammatical peculiarities, boomed forth in all
LINE 190: the deep solemnity of Mr. Gladstone's utterance. Not a single comment,
LINE 191: of any kind, was ever hazarded; and, after a fitting pause, the Cabinet
LINE 192: proceeded with the business of the day.
LINE 193: II
LINE 194: Little as Victoria appreciated her Prime Minister's attitude towards
LINE 195: her, she found that it had its uses. The popular discontent at her
LINE 196: uninterrupted seclusion had been gathering force for many years, and
LINE 197: now burst out in a new and alarming shape. Republicanism was in the air.
LINE 198: Radical opinion in England, stimulated by the fall of Napoleon III and
LINE 199: the establishment of a republican government in France, suddenly grew
LINE 200: more extreme than it ever had been since 1848. It also became for the
LINE 201: first time almost respectable. Chartism had been entirely an affair of
LINE 202: the lower classes; but now Members of Parliament, learned professors,
LINE 203: and ladies of title openly avowed the most subversive views. The
LINE 204: monarchy was attacked both in theory and in practice. And it was
LINE 205: attacked at a vital point: it was declared to be too expensive. What
LINE 206: benefits, it was asked, did the nation reap to counterbalance the
LINE 207: enormous sums which were expended upon the Sovereign? Victoria's
LINE 208: retirement gave an unpleasant handle to the argument. It was pointed out
LINE 209: that the ceremonial functions of the Crown had virtually lapsed; and the
LINE 210: awkward question remained whether any of the other functions which it
LINE 211: did continue to perform were really worth L385,000 per annum. The royal
LINE 212: balance-sheet was curiously examined. An anonymous pamphlet entitled
LINE 213: "What does she do with it?" appeared, setting forth the financial
LINE 214: position with malicious clarity. The Queen, it stated, was granted by
LINE 215: the Civil List L60,000 a year for her private use; but the rest of her
LINE 216: vast annuity was given, as the Act declared, to enable her "to defray
LINE 217: the expenses of her royal household and to support the honour and
LINE 218: dignity of the Crown." Now it was obvious that, since the death of the
LINE 219: Prince, the expenditure for both these purposes must have been very
LINE 220: considerably diminished, and it was difficult to resist the conclusion
LINE 221: that a large sum of money was diverted annually from the uses for which
LINE 222: it had been designed by Parliament, to swell the private fortune of
LINE 223: Victoria. The precise amount of that private fortune it was impossible
LINE 224: to discover; but there was reason to suppose that it was gigantic;
LINE 225: perhaps it reached a total of five million pounds. The pamphlet
LINE 226: protested against such a state of affairs, and its protests were
LINE 227: repeated vigorously in newspapers and at public meetings. Though it is
LINE 228: certain that the estimate of Victoria's riches was much exaggerated,
LINE 229: it is equally certain that she was an exceedingly wealthy woman. She
LINE 230: probably saved L20,000 a year from the Civil List, the revenues of
LINE 231: the Duchy of Lancaster were steadily increasing, she had inherited a
LINE 232: considerable property from the Prince Consort, and she had been left, in
LINE 233: 1852, an estate of half a million by Mr. John Neild, an eccentric
LINE 234: miser. In these circumstances it was not surprising that when, in 1871,
LINE 235: Parliament was asked to vote a dowry of L30,000 to the Princess Louise
LINE 236: on her marriage with the eldest son of the Duke of Argyle, together with
LINE 237: an annuity of L6,000, there should have been a serious outcry(*).
LINE 238: (*) In 1889 it was officially stated that the Queen's total
LINE 239: savings from the Civil List amounted to L824,025, but that
LINE 240: out of this sum much had been spent on special
LINE 241: entertainments to foreign visitors. Taking into
LINE 242: consideration the proceeds from the Duchy of Lancaster,
LINE 243: which were more than L60,000 a year, the savings of the
LINE 244: Prince Consort, and Mr. Neild's legacy, it seems probable
LINE 245: that, at the time of her death, Victoria's private fortune
LINE 246: approached two million pounds.
LINE 247: In order to conciliate public opinion, the Queen opened Parliament in
LINE 248: person, and the vote was passed almost unanimously. But a few months
LINE 249: later another demand was made: the Prince Arthur had come of age, and
LINE 250: the nation was asked to grant him an annuity of L15,000. The outcry was
LINE 251: redoubled. The newspapers were filled with angry articles; Bradlaugh
LINE 252: thundered against "princely paupers" to one of the largest crowds that
LINE 253: had ever been seen in Trafalgar Square; and Sir Charles Dilke expounded
LINE 254: the case for a republic in a speech to his constituents at Newcastle.
LINE 255: The Prince's annuity was ultimately sanctioned in the House of Commons
LINE 256: by a large majority; but a minority of fifty members voted in favour of
LINE 257: reducing the sum to L10,000.
LINE 258: Towards every aspect of this distasteful question, Mr. Gladstone
LINE 259: presented an iron front. He absolutely discountenanced the extreme
LINE 260: section of his followers. He declared that the whole of the Queen's
LINE 261: income was justly at her personal disposal, argued that to complain
LINE 262: of royal savings was merely to encourage royal extravagance, and
LINE 263: successfully convoyed through Parliament the unpopular annuities, which,
LINE 264: he pointed out, were strictly in accordance with precedent. When, in
LINE 265: 1872, Sir Charles Dilke once more returned to the charge in the House
LINE 266: of Commons, introducing a motion for a full enquiry into the Queen's
LINE 267: expenditure with a view to a root and branch reform of the Civil
LINE 268: List, the Prime Minister brought all the resources of his powerful
LINE 269: and ingenious eloquence to the support of the Crown. He was completely
LINE 270: successful; and amid a scene of great disorder the motion was
LINE 271: ignominiously dismissed. Victoria was relieved; but she grew no fonder
LINE 272: of Mr. Gladstone.
LINE 273: It was perhaps the most miserable moment of her life. The Ministers,
LINE 274: the press, the public, all conspired to vex her, to blame her, to
LINE 275: misinterpret her actions, to be unsympathetic and disrespectful in
LINE 276: every way. She was "a cruelly misunderstood woman," she told Mr. Martin,
LINE 277: complaining to him bitterly of the unjust attacks which were made upon
LINE 278: her, and declaring that "the great worry and anxiety and hard work for
LINE 279: ten years, alone, unaided, with increasing age and never very strong
LINE 280: health" were breaking her down, and "almost drove her to despair." The
LINE 281: situation was indeed deplorable. It seemed as if her whole existence
LINE 282: had gone awry; as if an irremediable antagonism had grown up between the
LINE 283: Queen and the nation. If Victoria had died in the early seventies, there
LINE 284: can be little doubt that the voice of the world would have pronounced
LINE 285: her a failure.
LINE 286: III
LINE 287: But she was reserved for a very different fate. The outburst of
LINE 288: republicanism had been in fact the last flicker of an expiring cause.
LINE 289: The liberal tide, which had been flowing steadily ever since the Reform
LINE 290: Bill, reached its height with Mr. Gladstone's first administration; and
LINE 291: towards the end of that administration the inevitable ebb began. The
LINE 292: reaction, when it came, was sudden and complete. The General Election of
LINE 293: 1874 changed the whole face of politics. Mr. Gladstone and the Liberals
LINE 294: were routed; and the Tory party, for the first time for over forty
LINE 295: years, attained an unquestioned supremacy in England. It was obvious
LINE 296: that their surprising triumph was pre-eminently due to the skill
LINE 297: and vigour of Disraeli. He returned to office, no longer the dubious
LINE 298: commander of an insufficient host, but with drums beating and flags
LINE 299: flying, a conquering hero. And as a conquering hero Victoria welcomed
LINE 300: her new Prime Minister.
LINE 301: Then there followed six years of excitement, of enchantment, of
LINE 302: felicity, of glory, of romance. The amazing being, who now at last, at
LINE 303: the age of seventy, after a lifetime of extraordinary struggles, had
LINE 304: turned into reality the absurdest of his boyhood's dreams, knew well
LINE 305: enough how to make his own, with absolute completeness, the heart of the
LINE 306: Sovereign Lady whose servant, and whose master, he had so miraculously
LINE 307: become. In women's hearts he had always read as in an open book. His
LINE 308: whole career had turned upon those curious entities; and the more
LINE 309: curious they were, the more intimately at home with them he seemed
LINE 310: to be. But Lady Beaconsfield, with her cracked idolatry, and Mrs.
LINE 311: Brydges-Williams, with her clogs, her corpulence, and her legacy,
LINE 312: were gone: an even more remarkable phenomenon stood in their place. He
LINE 313: surveyed what was before him with the eye of a past-master; and he was
LINE 314: not for a moment at a loss. He realised everything--the interacting
LINE 315: complexities of circumstance and character, the pride of place mingled
LINE 316: so inextricably with personal arrogance, the superabundant emotionalism,
LINE 317: the ingenuousness of outlook, the solid, the laborious respectability,
LINE 318: shot through so incongruously by temperamental cravings for the
LINE 319: coloured and the strange, the singular intellectual limitations, and the
LINE 320: mysteriously essential female elements impregnating every particle of
LINE 321: the whole. A smile hovered over his impassive features, and he
LINE 322: dubbed Victoria "the Faery." The name delighted him, for, with that
LINE 323: epigrammatic ambiguity so dear to his heart, it precisely expressed
LINE 324: his vision of the Queen. The Spenserian allusion was very pleasant--the
LINE 325: elegant evocations of Gloriana; but there was more in it than that:
LINE 326: there was the suggestion of a diminutive creature, endowed with
LINE 327: magical--and mythical--properties, and a portentousness almost
LINE 328: ridiculously out of keeping with the rest of her make-up. The Faery, he
LINE 329: determined, should henceforward wave her wand for him alone. Detachment
LINE 330: is always a rare quality, and rarest of all, perhaps, among politicians;
LINE 331: but that veteran egotist possessed it in a supreme degree. Not only did
LINE 332: he know what he had to do, not only did he do it; he was in the audience
LINE 333: as well as on the stage; and he took in with the rich relish of a
LINE 334: connoisseur every feature of the entertaining situation, every phase of
LINE 335: the delicate drama, and every detail of his own consummate performance.
LINE 336: The smile hovered and vanished, and, bowing low with Oriental gravity
LINE 337: and Oriental submissiveness, he set himself to his task. He had
LINE 338: understood from the first that in dealing with the Faery the appropriate
LINE 339: method of approach was the very antithesis of the Gladstonian; and such
LINE 340: a method was naturally his. It was not his habit to harangue and exhort
LINE 341: and expatiate in official conscientiousness; he liked to scatter flowers
LINE 342: along the path of business, to compress a weighty argument into a happy
LINE 343: phrase, to insinuate what was in his mind with an air of friendship
LINE 344: and confidential courtesy. He was nothing if not personal; and he had
LINE 345: perceived that personality was the key that opened the Faery's heart.
LINE 346: Accordingly, he never for a moment allowed his intercourse with her to
LINE 347: lose the personal tone; he invested all the transactions of State with
LINE 348: the charms of familiar conversation; she was always the royal lady, the
LINE 349: adored and revered mistress, he the devoted and respectful friend. When
LINE 350: once the personal relation was firmly established, every difficulty
LINE 351: disappeared. But to maintain that relation uninterruptedly in a smooth
LINE 352: and even course a particular care was necessary: the bearings had to be
LINE 353: most assiduously oiled. Nor was Disraeli in any doubt as to the nature
LINE 354: of the lubricant. "You have heard me called a flatterer," he said to
LINE 355: Matthew Arnold, "and it is true. Everyone likes flattery, and when you
LINE 356: come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel." He practiced what
LINE 357: he preached. His adulation was incessant, and he applied it in the very
LINE 358: thickest slabs. "There is no honor and no reward," he declared, "that
LINE 359: with him can ever equal the possession of your Majesty's kind thoughts.
LINE 360: All his own thoughts and feelings and duties and affections are now
LINE 361: concentrated in your Majesty, and he desires nothing more for his
LINE 362: remaining years than to serve your Majesty, or, if that service
LINE 363: ceases, to live still on its memory as a period of his existence most
LINE 364: interesting and fascinating." "In life," he told her, "one must have for
LINE 365: one's thoughts a sacred depository, and Lord Beaconsfield ever presumes
LINE 366: to seek that in his Sovereign Mistress." She was not only his own
LINE 367: solitary support; she was the one prop of the State. "If your Majesty
LINE 368: is ill," he wrote during a grave political crisis, "he is sure he will
LINE 369: himself break down. All, really, depends upon your Majesty." "He lives
LINE 370: only for Her," he asseverated, "and works only for Her, and without Her
LINE 371: all is lost." When her birthday came he produced an elaborate confection
LINE 372: of hyperbolic compliment. "To-day Lord Beaconsfield ought fitly,
LINE 373: perhaps, to congratulate a powerful Sovereign on her imperial sway, the
LINE 374: vastness of her Empire, and the success and strength of her fleets and
LINE 375: armies. But he cannot, his mind is in another mood. He can only think of
LINE 376: the strangeness of his destiny that it has come to pass that he should
LINE 377: be the servant of one so great, and whose infinite kindness, the
LINE 378: brightness of whose intelligence and the firmness of whose will, have
LINE 379: enabled him to undertake labours to which he otherwise would be quite
LINE 380: unequal, and supported him in all things by a condescending sympathy,
LINE 381: which in the hour of difficulty alike charms and inspires. Upon the
LINE 382: Sovereign of many lands and many hearts may an omnipotent Providence
LINE 383: shed every blessing that the wise can desire and the virtuous deserve!"
LINE 384: In those expert hands the trowel seemed to assume the qualities of
LINE 385: some lofty masonic symbol--to be the ornate and glittering vehicle of
LINE 386: verities unrealised by the profane.
LINE 387: Such tributes were delightful, but they remained in the nebulous region
LINE 388: of words, and Disraeli had determined to give his blandishments a more
LINE 389: significant solidity. He deliberately encouraged those high views of
LINE 390: her own position which had always been native to Victoria's mind and
LINE 391: had been reinforced by the principles of Albert and the doctrines of
LINE 392: Stockmar. He professed to a belief in a theory of the Constitution which
LINE 393: gave the Sovereign a leading place in the councils of government;
LINE 394: but his pronouncements upon the subject were indistinct; and when he
LINE 395: emphatically declared that there ought to be "a real Throne," it was
LINE 396: probably with the mental addition that that throne would be a very
LINE 397: unreal one indeed whose occupant was unamenable to his cajoleries.
LINE 398: But the vagueness of his language was in itself an added stimulant to
LINE 399: Victoria. Skilfully confusing the woman and the Queen, he threw, with a
LINE 400: grandiose gesture, the government of England at her feet, as if in doing
LINE 401: so he were performing an act of personal homage. In his first audience
LINE 402: after returning to power, he assured her that "whatever she wished
LINE 403: should be done." When the intricate Public Worship Regulation Bill was
LINE 404: being discussed by the Cabinet, he told the Faery that his "only object"
LINE 405: was "to further your Majesty's wishes in this matter." When he brought
LINE 406: off his great coup over the Suez Canal, he used expressions which
LINE 407: implied that the only gainer by the transaction was Victoria. "It is
LINE 408: just settled," he wrote in triumph; "you have it, Madam... Four millions
LINE 409: sterling! and almost immediately. There was only one firm that could
LINE 410: do it--Rothschilds. They behaved admirably; advanced the money at a low
LINE 411: rate, and the entire interest of the Khedive is now yours, Madam." Nor
LINE 412: did he limit himself to highly-spiced insinuations. Writing with all
LINE 413: the authority of his office, he advised the Queen that she had the
LINE 414: constitutional right to dismiss a Ministry which was supported by a
LINE 415: large majority in the House of Commons, he even urged her to do so, if,
LINE 416: in her opinion, "your Majesty's Government have from wilfulness, or even
LINE 417: from weakness, deceived your Majesty." To the horror of Mr. Gladstone,
LINE 418: he not only kept the Queen informed as to the general course of business
LINE 419: in the Cabinet, but revealed to her the part taken in its discussions by
LINE 420: individual members of it. Lord Derby, the son of the late Prime Minister
LINE 421: and Disraeli's Foreign Secretary, viewed these developments with grave
LINE 422: mistrust. "Is there not," he ventured to write to his Chief, "just a
LINE 423: risk of encouraging her in too large ideas of her personal power, and
LINE 424: too great indifference to what the public expects? I only ask; it is for
LINE 425: you to judge."
LINE 426: As for Victoria, she accepted everything--compliments, flatteries,
LINE 427: Elizabethan prerogatives--without a single qualm. After the long gloom
LINE 428: of her bereavement, after the chill of the Gladstonian discipline, she
LINE 429: expanded to the rays of Disraeli's devotion like a flower in the sun.
LINE 430: The change in her situation was indeed miraculous. No longer was she
LINE 431: obliged to puzzle for hours over the complicated details of business,
LINE 432: for now she had only to ask Mr. Disraeli for an explanation, and he
LINE 433: would give it her in the most concise, in the most amusing, way. No
LINE 434: longer was she worried by alarming novelties; no longer was she put out
LINE 435: at finding herself treated, by a reverential gentleman in high collars,
LINE 436: as if she were some embodied precedent, with a recondite knowledge of
LINE 437: Greek. And her deliverer was surely the most fascinating of men. The
LINE 438: strain of charlatanism, which had unconsciously captivated her in
LINE 439: Napoleon III, exercised the same enchanting effect in the case of
LINE 440: Disraeli. Like a dram-drinker, whose ordinary life is passed in dull
LINE 441: sobriety, her unsophisticated intelligence gulped down his rococo
LINE 442: allurements with peculiar zest. She became intoxicated, entranced.
LINE 443: Believing all that he told her of herself, she completely regained the
LINE 444: self-confidence which had been slipping away from her throughout
LINE 445: the dark period that followed Albert's death. She swelled with a new
LINE 446: elation, while he, conjuring up before her wonderful Oriental visions,
LINE 447: dazzled her eyes with an imperial grandeur of which she had only dimly
LINE 448: dreamed. Under the compelling influence, her very demeanour altered.
LINE 449: Her short, stout figure, with its folds of black velvet, its muslin
LINE 450: streamers, its heavy pearls at the heavy neck, assumed an almost
LINE 451: menacing air. In her countenance, from which the charm of youth had long
LINE 452: since vanished, and which had not yet been softened by age, the traces
LINE 453: of grief, of disappointment, and of displeasure were still visible, but
LINE 454: they were overlaid by looks of arrogance and sharp lines of peremptory
LINE 455: hauteur. Only, when Mr. Disraeli appeared, the expression changed in an
LINE 456: instant, and the forbidding visage became charged with smiles. For him
LINE 457: she would do anything. Yielding to his encouragements, she began to
LINE 458: emerge from her seclusion; she appeared in London in semi-state, at
LINE 459: hospitals and concerts; she opened Parliament; she reviewed troops and
LINE 460: distributed medals at Aldershot. But such public signs of favour were
LINE 461: trivial in comparison with her private attentions. During his flours of
LINE 462: audience, she could hardly restrain her excitement and delight. "I can
LINE 463: only describe my reception," he wrote to a friend on one occasion, "by
LINE 464: telling you that I really thought she was going to embrace me. She was
LINE 465: wreathed with smiles, and, as she tattled, glided about the room like
LINE 466: a bird." In his absence, she talked of him perpetually, and there was
LINE 467: a note of unusual vehemence in her solicitude for his health. "John
LINE 468: Manners," Disraeli told Lady Bradford, "who has just come from Osborne,
LINE 469: says that the Faery only talked of one subject, and that was her Primo.
LINE 470: According to him, it was her gracious opinion that the Government should
LINE 471: make my health a Cabinet question. Dear John seemed quite surprised at
LINE 472: what she said; but you are used to these ebullitions." She often sent
LINE 473: him presents; an illustrated album arrived for him regularly from
LINE 474: Windsor on Christmas Day. But her most valued gifts were the bunches of
LINE 475: spring flowers which, gathered by herself and her ladies in the woods at
LINE 476: Osborne, marked in an especial manner the warmth and tenderness of her
LINE 477: sentiments. Among these it was, he declared, the primroses that he loved
LINE 478: the best. They were, he said, "the ambassadors of Spring, the gems and
LINE 479: jewels of Nature." He liked them, he assured her, "so much better for
LINE 480: their being wild; they seem an offering from the Fauns and Dryads of
LINE 481: Osborne." "They show," he told her, "that your Majesty's sceptre has
LINE 482: touched the enchanted Isle." He sat at dinner with heaped-up bowls of
LINE 483: them on every side, and told his guests that "they were all sent to me
LINE 484: this morning by the Queen from Osborne, as she knows it is my favorite
LINE 485: flower."
LINE 486: As time went on, and as it became clearer and clearer that the
LINE 487: Faery's thraldom was complete, his protestations grew steadily more
LINE 488: highly--coloured and more unabashed. At last he ventured to import
LINE 489: into his blandishments a strain of adoration that was almost avowedly
LINE 490: romantic. In phrases of baroque convolution, he conveyed the message
LINE 491: of his heart. "The pressure of business," he wrote, had "so absorbed and
LINE 492: exhausted him, that towards the hour of post he has not had clearness
LINE 493: of mind, and vigour of pen, adequate to convey his thoughts and facts to
LINE 494: the most loved and illustrious being, who deigns to consider them." She
LINE 495: sent him some primroses, and he replied that he could "truly say they
LINE 496: are 'more precious than rubies,' coming, as they do, and at such a
LINE 497: moment, from a Sovereign whom he adores." She sent him snowdrops, and
LINE 498: his sentiment overflowed into poetry. "Yesterday eve," he wrote, "there
LINE 499: appeared, in Whitehall Gardens, a delicate-looking case, with a royal
LINE 500: superscription, which, when he opened, he thought, at first, that your
LINE 501: Majesty had graciously bestowed upon him the stars of your Majesty's
LINE 502: principal orders." And, indeed, he was so impressed with this graceful
LINE 503: illusion, that, having a banquet, where there were many stars and
LINE 504: ribbons, he could not resist the temptation, by placing some snowdrops
LINE 505: on his heart, of showing that, he, too, was decorated by a gracious
LINE 506: Sovereign.
LINE 507: Then, in the middle of the night, it occurred to him, that it might all
LINE 508: be an enchantment, and that, perhaps, it was a Faery gift and came from
LINE 509: another monarch: Queen Titania, gathering flowers, with her Court, in
LINE 510: a soft and sea-girt isle, and sending magic blossoms, which, they say,
LINE 511: turn the heads of those who receive them.
LINE 512: A Faery gift! Did he smile as he wrote the words? Perhaps; and yet
LINE 513: it would be rash to conclude that his perfervid declarations were
LINE 514: altogether without sincerity. Actor and spectator both, the two
LINE 515: characters were so intimately blended together in that odd composition
LINE 516: that they formed an inseparable unity, and it was impossible to say that
LINE 517: one of them was less genuine than the other. With one element, he
LINE 518: could coldly appraise the Faery's intellectual capacity, note with some
LINE 519: surprise that she could be on occasion "most interesting and amusing,"
LINE 520: and then continue his use of the trowel with an ironical solemnity;
LINE 521: while, with the other, he could be overwhelmed by the immemorial panoply
LINE 522: of royalty, and, thrilling with the sense of his own strange elevation,
LINE 523: dream himself into a gorgeous phantasy of crowns and powers and
LINE 524: chivalric love. When he told Victoria that "during a somewhat romantic
LINE 525: and imaginative life, nothing has ever occurred to him so interesting as
LINE 526: this confidential correspondence with one so exalted and so inspiring,"
LINE 527: was he not in earnest after all? When he wrote to a lady about the
LINE 528: Court, "I love the Queen--perhaps the only person in this world left to
LINE 529: me that I do love," was he not creating for himself an enchanted palace
LINE 530: out of the Arabian Nights, full of melancholy and spangles, in which
LINE 531: he actually believed? Victoria's state of mind was far more simple;
LINE 532: untroubled by imaginative yearnings, she never lost herself in that
LINE 533: nebulous region of the spirit where feeling and fancy grow confused. Her
LINE 534: emotions, with all their intensity and all their exaggeration, retained
LINE 535: the plain prosaic texture of everyday life. And it was fitting that her
LINE 536: expression of them should be equally commonplace. She was, she told her
LINE 537: Prime Minister, at the end of an official letter, "yours aff'ly V. R.
LINE 538: and I." In such a phrase the deep reality of her feeling is instantly
LINE 539: manifest. The Faery's feet were on the solid earth; it was the ruse
LINE 540: cynic who was in the air.
LINE 541: He had taught her, however, a lesson, which she had learnt with alarming
LINE 542: rapidity. A second Gloriana, did he call her? Very well, then, she would
LINE 543: show that she deserved the compliment. Disquieting symptoms followed
LINE 544: fast. In May, 1874, the Tsar, whose daughter had just been married to
LINE 545: Victoria's second son, the Duke of Edinburgh, was in London, and, by an
LINE 546: unfortunate error, it had been arranged that his departure should not
LINE 547: take place until two days after the date on which his royal hostess had
LINE 548: previously decided to go to Balmoral. Her Majesty refused to modify
LINE 549: her plans. It was pointed out to her that the Tsar would certainly be
LINE 550: offended, that the most serious consequences might follow; Lord Derby
LINE 551: protested; Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, was much
LINE 552: perturbed. But the Faery was unconcerned; she had settled to go to
LINE 553: Balmoral on the 18th, and on the 18th she would go. At last Disraeli,
LINE 554: exercising all his influence, induced her to agree to stay in London
LINE 555: for two days more. "My head is still on my shoulders," he told Lady
LINE 556: Bradford. "The great lady has absolutely postponed her departure!
LINE 557: Everybody had failed, even the Prince of Wales... and I have no doubt I
LINE 558: am not in favour. I can't help it. Salisbury says I have saved an Afghan
LINE 559: War, and Derby compliments me on my unrivalled triumph." But before very
LINE 560: long, on another issue, the triumph was the Faery's. Disraeli, who had
LINE 561: suddenly veered towards a new Imperialism, had thrown out the suggestion
LINE 562: that the Queen of England ought to become the Empress of India. Victoria
LINE 563: seized upon the idea with avidity, and, in season and out of season,
LINE 564: pressed upon her Prime Minister the desirability of putting his proposal
LINE 565: into practice. He demurred; but she was not to be baulked; and in 1876,
LINE 566: in spite of his own unwillingness and that of his entire Cabinet, he
LINE 567: found himself obliged to add to the troubles of a stormy session
LINE 568: by introducing a bill for the alteration of the Royal Title. His
LINE 569: compliance, however, finally conquered the Faery's heart. The measure
LINE 570: was angrily attacked in both Houses, and Victoria was deeply touched by
LINE 571: the untiring energy with which Disraeli defended it. She was, she said,
LINE 572: much grieved by "the worry and annoyance" to which he was subjected; she
LINE 573: feared she was the cause of it; and she would never forget what she owed
LINE 574: to "her kind, good, and considerate friend." At the same time, her wrath
LINE 575: fell on the Opposition. Their conduct, she declared, was "extraordinary,
LINE 576: incomprehensible, and mistaken," and, in an emphatic sentence which
LINE 577: seemed to contradict both itself and all her former proceedings, she
LINE 578: protested that she "would be glad if it were more generally known that
LINE 579: it was HER wish, as people WILL have it, that it has been FORCED UPON
LINE 580: HER!" When the affair was successfully over, the imperial triumph was
LINE 581: celebrated in a suitable manner. On the day of the Delhi Proclamation,
LINE 582: the new Earl of Beaconsfield went to Windsor to dine with the new
LINE 583: Empress of India. That night the Faery, usually so homely in her attire,
LINE 584: appeared in a glittering panoply of enormous uncut jewels, which had
LINE 585: been presented to her by the reigning Princes of her Raj. At the end of
LINE 586: the meal the Prime Minister, breaking through the rules of
LINE 587: etiquette, arose, and in a flowery oration proposed the health of
LINE 588: the Queen-Empress. His audacity was well received, and his speech was
LINE 589: rewarded by a smiling curtsey.
LINE 590: These were significant episodes; but a still more serious manifestation
LINE 591: of Victoria's temper occurred in the following year, during the crowning
LINE 592: crisis of Beaconsfield's life. His growing imperialism, his desire
LINE 593: to magnify the power and prestige of England, his insistence upon a
LINE 594: "spirited foreign policy," had brought him into collision with Russia;
LINE 595: the terrible Eastern Question loomed up; and when war broke out between
LINE 596: Russia and Turkey, the gravity of the situation became extreme.
LINE 597: The Prime Minister's policy was fraught with difficulty and danger.
LINE 598: Realising perfectly the appalling implications of an Anglo-Russian war,
LINE 599: he was yet prepared to face even that eventuality if he could obtain
LINE 600: his ends by no other method; but he believed that Russia in reality was
LINE 601: still less desirous of a rupture, and that, if he played his game with
LINE 602: sufficient boldness and adroitness, she would yield, when it came to the
LINE 603: point, all that he required without a blow. It was clear that the
LINE 604: course he had marked out for himself was full of hazard, and demanded
LINE 605: an extraordinary nerve; a single false step, and either himself, or
LINE 606: England, might be plunged in disaster. But nerve he had never lacked;
LINE 607: he began his diplomatic egg-dance with high assurance; and then he
LINE 608: discovered that, besides the Russian Government, besides the Liberals
LINE 609: and Mr. Gladstone, there were two additional sources of perilous
LINE 610: embarrassment with which he would have to reckon. In the first place
LINE 611: there was a strong party in the Cabinet, headed by Lord Derby, the
LINE 612: Foreign Secretary, which was unwilling to take the risk of war; but his
LINE 613: culminating anxiety was the Faery.
LINE 614: From the first, her attitude was uncompromising. The old hatred of
LINE 615: Russia, which had been engendered by the Crimean War, surged up again
LINE 616: within her; she remembered Albert's prolonged animosity; she felt the
LINE 617: prickings of her own greatness; and she flung herself into the turmoil
LINE 618: with passionate heat. Her indignation with the Opposition--with anyone
LINE 619: who ventured to sympathise with the Russians in their quarrel with the
LINE 620: Turks--was unbounded. When anti-Turkish meetings were held in London,
LINE 621: presided over by the Duke of Westminster and Lord Shaftesbury, and
LINE 622: attended by Mr. Gladstone and other prominent Radicals, she considered
LINE 623: that "the Attorney-General ought to be set at these men;" "it can't,"
LINE 624: she exclaimed, "be constitutional." Never in her life, not even in the
LINE 625: crisis over the Ladies of the Bedchamber, did she show herself a more
LINE 626: furious partisan. But her displeasure was not reserved for the Radicals;
LINE 627: the backsliding Conservatives equally felt its force. She was even
LINE 628: discontented with Lord Beaconsfield himself. Failing entirely to
LINE 629: appreciate the delicate complexity of his policy, she constantly
LINE 630: assailed him with demands for vigorous action, interpreted each finesse
LINE 631: as a sign of weakness, and was ready at every juncture to let slip the
LINE 632: dogs of war. As the situation developed, her anxiety grew feverish. "The
LINE 633: Queen," she wrote, "is feeling terribly anxious lest delay should cause
LINE 634: us to be too late and lose our prestige for ever! It worries her night
LINE 635: and day." "The Faery," Beaconsfield told Lady Bradford, "writes every
LINE 636: day and telegraphs every hour; this is almost literally the case." She
LINE 637: raged loudly against the Russians. "And the language," she cried,
LINE 638: "the insulting language--used by the Russians against us! It makes the
LINE 639: Queen's blood boil!" "Oh," she wrote a little later, "if the Queen were
LINE 640: a man, she would like to go and give those Russians, whose word one
LINE 641: cannot believe, such a beating! We shall never be friends again till we
LINE 642: have it out. This the Queen feels sure of."
LINE 643: The unfortunate Prime Minister, urged on to violence by Victoria on
LINE 644: one side, had to deal, on the other, with a Foreign Secretary who was
LINE 645: fundamentally opposed to any policy of active interference at all.
LINE 646: Between the Queen and Lord Derby he held a harassed course. He gained,
LINE 647: indeed, some slight satisfaction in playing on the one against the
LINE 648: other--in stimulating Lord Derby with the Queen's missives, and in
LINE 649: appeasing the Queen by repudiating Lord Derby's opinions; on one
LINE 650: occasion he actually went so far as to compose, at Victoria's request,
LINE 651: a letter bitterly attacking his colleague, which Her Majesty forthwith
LINE 652: signed, and sent, without alteration, to the Foreign Secretary. But such
LINE 653: devices only gave a temporary relief; and it soon became evident that
LINE 654: Victoria's martial ardour was not to be sidetracked by hostilities
LINE 655: against Lord Derby; hostilities against Russia were what she wanted,
LINE 656: what she would, what she must, have. For now, casting aside the last
LINE 657: relics of moderation, she began to attack her friend with a series of
LINE 658: extraordinary threats. Not once, not twice, but many times she held over
LINE 659: his head the formidable menace of her imminent abdication. "If England,"
LINE 660: she wrote to Beaconsfield, "is to kiss Russia's feet, she will not be a
LINE 661: party to the humiliation of England and would lay down her crown," and
LINE 662: she added that the Prime Minister might, if he thought fit, repeat her
LINE 663: words to the Cabinet. "This delay," she ejaculated, "this uncertainty by
LINE 664: which, abroad, we are losing our prestige and our position, while Russia
LINE 665: is advancing and will be before Constantinople in no time! Then the
LINE 666: Government will be fearfully blamed and the Queen so humiliated that
LINE 667: she thinks she would abdicate at once. Be bold!" "She feels," she
LINE 668: reiterated, "she cannot, as she before said, remain the Sovereign of
LINE 669: a country that is letting itself down to kiss the feet of the great
LINE 670: barbarians, the retarders of all liberty and civilisation that exists."
LINE 671: When the Russians advanced to the outskirts of Constantinople she fired
LINE 672: off three letters in a day demanding war; and when she learnt that the
LINE 673: Cabinet had only decided to send the Fleet to Gallipoli she declared
LINE 674: that "her first impulse" was "to lay down the thorny crown, which she
LINE 675: feels little satisfaction in retaining if the position of this country
LINE 676: is to remain as it is now." It is easy to imagine the agitating effect
LINE 677: of such a correspondence upon Beaconsfield. This was no longer the
LINE 678: Faery; it was a genie whom he had rashly called out of her bottle, and
LINE 679: who was now intent upon showing her supernal power. More than once,
LINE 680: perplexed, dispirited, shattered by illness, he had thoughts of
LINE 681: withdrawing altogether from the game. One thing alone, he told Lady
LINE 682: Bradford, with a wry smile, prevented him. "If I could only," he wrote,
LINE 683: "face the scene which would occur at headquarters if I resigned, I would
LINE 684: do so at once."
LINE 685: He held on, however, to emerge victorious at last. The Queen was
LINE 686: pacified; Lord Derby was replaced by Lord Salisbury; and at the Congress
LINE 687: of Berlin der alte Jude carried all before him. He returned to England
LINE 688: in triumph, and assured the delighted Victoria that she would very soon
LINE 689: be, if she was not already, the "Dictatress of Europe."
LINE 690: But soon there was an unexpected reverse. At the General Election
LINE 691: of 1880 the country, mistrustful of the forward policy of the
LINE 692: Conservatives, and carried away by Mr. Gladstone's oratory, returned the
LINE 693: Liberals to power. Victoria was horrified, but within a year she was to
LINE 694: be yet more nearly hit. The grand romance had come to its conclusion.
LINE 695: Lord Beaconsfield, worn out with age and maladies, but moving still, an
LINE 696: assiduous mummy, from dinner-party to dinner-party, suddenly moved no
LINE 697: longer. When she knew that the end was inevitable, she seemed, by a
LINE 698: pathetic instinct, to divest herself of her royalty, and to shrink, with
LINE 699: hushed gentleness, beside him, a woman and nothing more. "I send some
LINE 700: Osborne primroses," she wrote to him with touching simplicity, "and I
LINE 701: meant to pay you a little visit this week, but I thought it better you
LINE 702: should be quite quiet and not speak. And I beg you will be very good and
LINE 703: obey the doctors." She would see him, she said, "when we, come back from
LINE 704: Osborne, which won't be long." "Everyone is so distressed at your not
LINE 705: being well," she added; and she was, "Ever yours very aff'ly V.R.I."
LINE 706: When the royal letter was given him, the strange old comedian, stretched
LINE 707: on his bed of death, poised it in his hand, appeared to consider deeply,
LINE 708: and then whispered to those about him, "This ought to be read to me by a
LINE 709: Privy Councillor."
