LINE 1: I
LINE 2: Meanwhile in Victoria's private life many changes and developments had
LINE 3: taken place. With the marriages of her elder children her family
LINE 4: circle widened; grandchildren appeared; and a multitude of new domestic
LINE 5: interests sprang up. The death of King Leopold in 1865 had removed the
LINE 6: predominant figure of the older generation, and the functions he had
LINE 7: performed as the centre and adviser of a large group of relatives in
LINE 8: Germany and in England devolved upon Victoria. These functions
LINE 9: she discharged with unremitting industry, carrying on an enormous
LINE 10: correspondence, and following with absorbed interest every detail in the
LINE 11: lives of the ever-ramifying cousinhood. And she tasted to the full
LINE 12: both the joys and the pains of family affection. She took a particular
LINE 13: delight in her grandchildren, to whom she showed an indulgence which
LINE 14: their parents had not always enjoyed, though, even to her grandchildren,
LINE 15: she could be, when the occasion demanded it, severe. The eldest of them,
LINE 16: the little Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, was a remarkably headstrong child;
LINE 17: he dared to be impertinent even to his grandmother; and once, when she
LINE 18: told him to bow to a visitor at Osborne, he disobeyed her outright.
LINE 19: This would not do: the order was sternly repeated, and the naughty boy,
LINE 20: noticing that his grandmama had suddenly turned into a most terrifying
LINE 21: lady, submitted his will to hers, and bowed very low indeed.
LINE 22: It would have been well if all the Queen's domestic troubles could
LINE 23: have been got over as easily. Among her more serious distresses was the
LINE 24: conduct of the Prince of Wales. The young man was now independent and
LINE 25: married; he had shaken the parental yoke from his shoulders; he was
LINE 26: positively beginning to do as he liked. Victoria was much perturbed,
LINE 27: and her worst fears seemed to be justified when in 1870 he appeared as
LINE 28: a witness in a society divorce case. It was clear that the heir to the
LINE 29: throne had been mixing with people of whom she did not at all approve.
LINE 30: What was to be done? She saw that it was not only her son that was to
LINE 31: blame--that it was the whole system of society; and so she despatched
LINE 32: a letter to Mr. Delane, the editor of The Times, asking him if he would
LINE 33: "frequently WRITE articles pointing out the IMMENSE danger and evil of
LINE 34: the wretched frivolity and levity of the views and lives of the Higher
LINE 35: Classes." And five years later Mr. Delane did write an article upon that
LINE 36: very subject. Yet it seemed to have very little effect.
LINE 37: Ah! if only the Higher Classes would learn to live as she lived in the
LINE 38: domestic sobriety of her sanctuary at Balmoral! For more and more
LINE 39: did she find solace and refreshment in her Highland domain; and twice
LINE 40: yearly, in the spring and in the autumn, with a sigh of relief, she set
LINE 41: her face northwards, in spite of the humble protests of Ministers, who
LINE 42: murmured vainly in the royal ears that to transact the affairs of State
LINE 43: over an interval of six hundred miles added considerably to the cares
LINE 44: of government. Her ladies, too, felt occasionally a slight reluctance to
LINE 45: set out, for, especially in the early days, the long pilgrimage was not
LINE 46: without its drawbacks. For many years the Queen's conservatism forbade
LINE 47: the continuation of the railway up Deeside, so that the last stages
LINE 48: of the journey had to be accomplished in carriages. But, after all,
LINE 49: carriages had their good points; they were easy, for instance, to get
LINE 50: in and out of, which was an important consideration, for the royal train
LINE 51: remained for long immune from modern conveniences, and when it drew up,
LINE 52: on some border moorland, far from any platform, the highbred dames were
LINE 53: obliged to descend to earth by the perilous foot-board, the only pair
LINE 54: of folding steps being reserved for Her Majesty's saloon. In the days of
LINE 55: crinolines such moments were sometimes awkward; and it was occasionally
LINE 56: necessary to summon Mr. Johnstone, the short and sturdy Manager of the
LINE 57: Caledonian Railway, who, more than once, in a high gale and drenching
LINE 58: rain with great difficulty "pushed up"--as he himself described it--some
LINE 59: unlucky Lady Blanche or Lady Agatha into her compartment. But Victoria
LINE 60: cared for none of these things. She was only intent upon regaining, with
LINE 61: the utmost swiftness, her enchanted Castle, where every spot was charged
LINE 62: with memories, where every memory was sacred, and where life was passed
LINE 63: in an incessant and delightful round of absolutely trivial events.
LINE 64: And it was not only the place that she loved; she was equally attached
LINE 65: to "the simple mountaineers," from whom, she said, "she learnt many
LINE 66: a lesson of resignation and faith." Smith and Grant and Ross and
LINE 67: Thompson--she was devoted to them all; but, beyond the rest, she was
LINE 68: devoted to John Brown. The Prince's gillie had now become the Queen's
LINE 69: personal attendant--a body servant from whom she was never parted, who
LINE 70: accompanied her on her drives, waited on her during the day, and
LINE 71: slept in a neighbouring chamber at night. She liked his strength, his
LINE 72: solidity, the sense he gave her of physical security; she even liked his
LINE 73: rugged manners and his rough unaccommodating speech. She allowed him to
LINE 74: take liberties with her which would have been unthinkable from anybody
LINE 75: else. To bully the Queen, to order her about, to reprimand her--who
LINE 76: could dream of venturing upon such audacities? And yet, when she
LINE 77: received such treatment from John Brown, she positively seemed to enjoy
LINE 78: it. The eccentricity appeared to be extraordinary; but, after all, it
LINE 79: is no uncommon thing for an autocratic dowager to allow some trusted
LINE 80: indispensable servant to adopt towards her an attitude of authority
LINE 81: which is jealously forbidden to relatives or friends: the power of a
LINE 82: dependent still remains, by a psychological sleight-of-hand, one's own
LINE 83: power, even when it is exercised over oneself. When Victoria meekly
LINE 84: obeyed the abrupt commands of her henchman to get off her pony or put on
LINE 85: her shawl, was she not displaying, and in the highest degree, the force
LINE 86: of her volition? People might wonder; she could not help that; this was
LINE 87: the manner in which it pleased her to act, and there was an end of it.
LINE 88: To have submitted her judgment to a son or a Minister might have seemed
LINE 89: wiser or more natural; but if she had done so, she instinctively felt,
LINE 90: she would indeed have lost her independence. And yet upon somebody
LINE 91: she longed to depend. Her days were heavy with the long process of
LINE 92: domination. As she drove in silence over the moors she leaned back in
LINE 93: the carriage, oppressed and weary; but what a relief--John Brown was
LINE 94: behind on the rumble, and his strong arm would be there for her to lean
LINE 95: upon when she got out.
LINE 96: He had, too, in her mind, a special connection with Albert. In their
LINE 97: expeditions the Prince had always trusted him more than anyone; the
LINE 98: gruff, kind, hairy Scotsman was, she felt, in some mysterious way,
LINE 99: a legacy from the dead. She came to believe at last--or so it
LINE 100: appeared--that the spirit of Albert was nearer when Brown was near.
LINE 101: Often, when seeking inspiration over some complicated question of
LINE 102: political or domestic import, she would gaze with deep concentration at
LINE 103: her late husband's bust. But it was also noticed that sometimes in such
LINE 104: moments of doubt and hesitation Her Majesty's looks would fix themselves
LINE 105: upon John Brown.
LINE 106: Eventually, the "simple mountaineer" became almost a state personage.
LINE 107: The influence which he wielded was not to be overlooked. Lord
LINE 108: Beaconsfield was careful, from time to time, to send courteous messages
LINE 109: to "Mr. Brown" in his letters to the Queen, and the French Government
LINE 110: took particular pains to provide for his comfort during the visits of
LINE 111: the English Sovereign to France. It was only natural that among the
LINE 112: elder members of the royal family he should not have been popular, and
LINE 113: that his failings--for failings he had, though Victoria would never
LINE 114: notice his too acute appreciation of Scotch whisky--should have been
LINE 115: the subject of acrimonious comment at Court. But he served his mistress
LINE 116: faithfully, and to ignore him would be a sign of disrespect to her
LINE 117: biographer. For the Queen, far from making a secret of her affectionate
LINE 118: friendship, took care to publish it to the world. By her orders two
LINE 119: gold medals were struck in his honour; on his death, in 1883, a long and
LINE 120: eulogistic obituary notice of him appeared in the Court Circular; and a
LINE 121: Brown memorial brooch--of gold, with the late gillie's head on one side
LINE 122: and the royal monogram on the other--was designed by Her Majesty for
LINE 123: presentation to her Highland servants and cottagers, to be worn by them
LINE 124: on the anniversary of his death, with a mourning scarf and pins. In the
LINE 125: second series of extracts from the Queen's Highland Journal, published
LINE 126: in 1884, her "devoted personal attendant and faithful friend" appears
LINE 127: upon almost every page, and is in effect the hero of the book. With an
LINE 128: absence of reticence remarkable in royal persons, Victoria seemed to
LINE 129: demand, in this private and delicate matter, the sympathy of the whole
LINE 130: nation; and yet--such is the world--there were those who actually
LINE 131: treated the relations between their Sovereign and her servant as a theme
LINE 132: for ribald jests.
LINE 133: II
LINE 134: The busy years hastened away; the traces of Time's unimaginable touch
LINE 135: grew manifest; and old age, approaching, laid a gentle hold upon
LINE 136: Victoria. The grey hair whitened; the mature features mellowed; the
LINE 137: short firm figure amplified and moved more slowly, supported by a stick.
LINE 138: And, simultaneously, in the whole tenour of the Queen's existence an
LINE 139: extraordinary transformation came to pass. The nation's attitude
LINE 140: towards her, critical and even hostile as it had been for so many years,
LINE 141: altogether changed; while there was a corresponding alteration in the
LINE 142: temper of--Victoria's own mind.
LINE 143: Many causes led to this result. Among them were the repeated strokes of
LINE 144: personal misfortune which befell the Queen during a cruelly short space
LINE 145: of years. In 1878 the Princess Alice, who had married in 1862 the Prince
LINE 146: Louis of Hesse-Darmstadt, died in tragic circumstances. In the following
LINE 147: year the Prince Imperial, the only son of the Empress Eugenie, to whom
LINE 148: Victoria, since the catastrophe of 1870, had become devotedly attached,
LINE 149: was killed in the Zulu War. Two years later, in 1881, the Queen lost
LINE 150: Lord Beaconsfield, and, in 1883, John Brown. In 1884 the Prince Leopold,
LINE 151: Duke of Albany, who had been an invalid from birth, died prematurely,
LINE 152: shortly after his marriage. Victoria's cup of sorrows was indeed
LINE 153: overflowing; and the public, as it watched the widowed mother weeping
LINE 154: for her children and her friends, displayed a constantly increasing
LINE 155: sympathy.
LINE 156: An event which occurred in 1882 revealed and accentuated the feelings of
LINE 157: the nation. As the Queen, at Windsor, was walking from the train to her
LINE 158: carriage, a youth named Roderick Maclean fired a pistol at her from a
LINE 159: distance of a few yards. An Eton boy struck up Maclean's arm with an
LINE 160: umbrella before the pistol went off; no damage was done, and the culprit
LINE 161: was at once arrested. This was the last of a series of seven attempts
LINE 162: upon the Queen--attempts which, taking place at sporadic intervals over
LINE 163: a period of forty years, resembled one another in a curious manner. All,
LINE 164: with a single exception, were perpetrated by adolescents, whose motives
LINE 165: were apparently not murderous, since, save in the case of Maclean, none
LINE 166: of their pistols was loaded. These unhappy youths, who, after buying
LINE 167: their cheap weapons, stuffed them with gunpowder and paper, and then
LINE 168: went off, with the certainty of immediate detection, to click them in
LINE 169: the face of royalty, present a strange problem to the psychologist. But,
LINE 170: though in each case their actions and their purposes seemed to be so
LINE 171: similar, their fates were remarkably varied. The first of them, Edward
LINE 172: Oxford, who fired at Victoria within a few months of her marriage, was
LINE 173: tried for high treason, declared to be insane, and sent to an asylum for
LINE 174: life. It appears, however, that this sentence did not commend itself to
LINE 175: Albert, for when, two years later, John Francis committed the same of
LINE 176: fence, and was tried upon the same charge, the Prince propounced that
LINE 177: there was no insanity in the matter. "The wretched creature," he told
LINE 178: his father, was "not out of his mind, but a thorough scamp." "I hope,"
LINE 179: he added, "his trial will be conducted with the greatest strictness."
LINE 180: Apparently it was; at any rate, the jury shared the view of the Prince,
LINE 181: the plea of insanity was, set aside, and Francis was found guilty of
LINE 182: high treason and condemned to death; but, as there was no proof of
LINE 183: an intent to kill or even to wound, this sentence, after a lengthened
LINE 184: deliberation between the Home Secretary and the Judges, was commuted for
LINE 185: one of transportation for life. As the law stood, these assaults, futile
LINE 186: as they were, could only be treated as high treason; the discrepancy
LINE 187: between the actual deed and the tremendous penalties involved was
LINE 188: obviously grotesque; and it was, besides, clear that a jury, knowing
LINE 189: that a verdict of guilty implied a sentence of death, would tend to
LINE 190: the alternative course, and find the prisoner not guilty but insane--a
LINE 191: conclusion which, on the face of it, would have appeared to be the more
LINE 192: reasonable. In 1842, therefore, an Act was passed making any attempt
LINE 193: to hurt the Queen a misdemeanor, punishable by transportation for seven
LINE 194: years, or imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not
LINE 195: exceeding three years--the misdemeanant, at the discretion of the Court,
LINE 196: "to be publicly or privately whipped, as often, and in such manner
LINE 197: and form, as the Court shall direct, not exceeding thrice." The four
LINE 198: subsequent attempts were all dealt with under this new law; William
LINE 199: Bean, in 1842, was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment; William
LINE 200: Hamilton, in 1849, was transported for seven years; and, in 1850, the
LINE 201: same sentence was passed upon Lieutenant Robert Pate, who struck the
LINE 202: Queen on the head with his cane in Piccadilly. Pate, alone among these
LINE 203: delinquents, was of mature years; he had held a commission in the Army,
LINE 204: dressed himself as a dandy, and was, the Prince declared, "manifestly
LINE 205: deranged." In 1872 Arthur O'Connor, a youth of seventeen, fired
LINE 206: an unloaded pistol at the Queen outside Buckingham Palace; he
LINE 207: was immediately seized by John Brown, and sentenced to one year's
LINE 208: imprisonment and twenty strokes of the birch rod. It was for his bravery
LINE 209: upon this occasion that Brown was presented with one of his gold medals.
LINE 210: In all these cases the jury had refused to allow the plea of insanity;
LINE 211: but Roderick Maclean's attempt in 1882 had a different issue. On this
LINE 212: occasion the pistol was found to have been loaded, and the public
LINE 213: indignation, emphasised as it was by Victoria's growing popularity,
LINE 214: was particularly great. Either for this or for some other reason the
LINE 215: procedure of the last forty years was abandoned, and Maclean was tried
LINE 216: for high treason. The result was what might have been expected: the jury
LINE 217: brought in a verdict of "not guilty, but insane"; and the prisoner was
LINE 218: sent to an asylum during Her Majesty's pleasure. Their verdict, however,
LINE 219: produced a remarkable consequence. Victoria, who doubtless carried in
LINE 220: her mind some memory of Albert's disapproval of a similar verdict in
LINE 221: the case of Oxford, was very much annoyed. What did the jury mean, she
LINE 222: asked, by saying that Maclean was not guilty? It was perfectly clear
LINE 223: that he was guilty--she had seen him fire off the pistol herself. It was
LINE 224: in vain that Her Majesty's constitutional advisers reminded her of the
LINE 225: principle of English law which lays down that no man can be found
LINE 226: guilty of a crime unless he be proved to have had a criminal intention.
LINE 227: Victoria was quite unconvinced. "If that is the law," she said, "the law
LINE 228: must be altered:" and altered it was. In 1883 an Act was passed changing
LINE 229: the form of the verdict in cases of insanity, and the confusing anomaly
LINE 230: remains upon the Statute Book to this day.
LINE 231: But it was not only through the feelings--commiserating or indignant--of
LINE 232: personal sympathy that the Queen and her people were being drawn more
LINE 233: nearly together; they were beginning, at last, to come to a close and
LINE 234: permanent agreement upon the conduct of public affairs. Mr. Gladstone's
LINE 235: second administration (1880-85) was a succession of failures, ending in
LINE 236: disaster and disgrace; liberalism fell into discredit with the country,
LINE 237: and Victoria perceived with joy that her distrust of her Ministers was
LINE 238: shared by an ever-increasing number of her subjects. During the crisis
LINE 239: in the Sudan, the popular temper was her own. She had been among the
LINE 240: first to urge the necessity of an expedition to Khartoum, and, when the
LINE 241: news came of the catastrophic death of General Gordon, her voice led the
LINE 242: chorus of denunciation which raved against the Government. In her rage,
LINE 243: she despatched a fulminating telegram to Mr. Gladstone, not in the usual
LINE 244: cypher, but open; and her letter of condolence to Miss Gordon, in which
LINE 245: she attacked her Ministers for breach of faith, was widely published.
LINE 246: It was rumoured that she had sent for Lord Hartington, the Secretary
LINE 247: of State for War, and vehemently upbraided him. "She rated me," he was
LINE 248: reported to have told a friend, "as if I'd been a footman." "Why didn't
LINE 249: she send for the butler?" asked his friend. "Oh," was the reply, "the
LINE 250: butler generally manages to keep out of the way on such occasions."
LINE 251: But the day came when it was impossible to keep out of the way any
LINE 252: longer. Mr. Gladstone was defeated, and resigned. Victoria, at a
LINE 253: final interview, received him with her usual amenity, but, besides the
LINE 254: formalities demanded by the occasion, the only remark which she made
LINE 255: to him of a personal nature was to the effect that she supposed Mr.
LINE 256: Gladstone would now require some rest. He remembered with regret how,
LINE 257: at a similar audience in 1874, she had expressed her trust in him as a
LINE 258: supporter of the throne; but he noted the change without surprise. "Her
LINE 259: mind and opinions," he wrote in his diary afterwards, "have since that
LINE 260: day been seriously warped."
LINE 261: Such was Mr. Gladstone's view,; but the majority of the nation by no
LINE 262: means agreed with him; and, in the General Election of 1886, they
LINE 263: showed decisively that Victoria's politics were identical with theirs
LINE 264: by casting forth the contrivers of Home Rule--that abomination of
LINE 265: desolation--into outer darkness, and placing Lord Salisbury in
LINE 266: power. Victoria's satisfaction was profound. A flood of new unwonted
LINE 267: hopefulness swept over her, stimulating her vital spirits with a
LINE 268: surprising force. Her habit of life was suddenly altered; abandoning
LINE 269: the long seclusion which Disraeli's persuasions had only momentarily
LINE 270: interrupted, she threw herself vigorously into a multitude of public
LINE 271: activities. She appeared at drawing-rooms, at concerts, at reviews; she
LINE 272: laid foundation-stones; she went to Liverpool to open an international
LINE 273: exhibition, driving through the streets in her open carriage in heavy
LINE 274: rain amid vast applauding crowds. Delighted by the welcome which met
LINE 275: her everywhere, she warmed to her work. She visited Edinburgh, where the
LINE 276: ovation of Liverpool was repeated and surpassed. In London, she opened
LINE 277: in high state the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at South Kensington.
LINE 278: On this occasion the ceremonial was particularly magnificent; a blare
LINE 279: of trumpets announced the approach of Her Majesty; the "Natiohal Anthem"
LINE 280: followed; and the Queen, seated on a gorgeous throne of hammered gold,
LINE 281: replied with her own lips to the address that was presented to her. Then
LINE 282: she rose, and, advancing upon the platform with regal port, acknowledged
LINE 283: the acclamations of the great assembly by a succession of curtseys, of
LINE 284: elaborate and commanding grace.
LINE 285: Next year was the fiftieth of her reign, and in June the splendid
LINE 286: anniversary was celebrated in solemn pomp. Victoria, surrounded by the
LINE 287: highest dignitaries of her realm, escorted by a glittering galaxy of
LINE 288: kings and princes, drove through the crowded enthusiasm of the capital
LINE 289: to render thanks to God in Westminster Abbey. In that triumphant hour
LINE 290: the last remaining traces of past antipathies and past disagreements
LINE 291: were altogether swept away. The Queen was hailed at once as the mother
LINE 292: of her people and as the embodied symbol of their imperial greatness;
LINE 293: and she responded to the double sentiment with all the ardour of her
LINE 294: spirit. England and the people of England, she knew it, she felt it,
LINE 295: were, in some wonderful and yet quite simple manner, hers. Exultation,
LINE 296: affection, gratitude, a profound sense of obligation, an unbounded
LINE 297: pride--such were her emotions; and, colouring and intensifying the
LINE 298: rest, there was something else. At last, after so long,
LINE 299: happiness--fragmentary, perhaps, and charged with gravity, but true
LINE 300: and unmistakable none the less--had returned to her. The unaccustomed
LINE 301: feeling filled and warmed her consciousness. When, at Buckingham Palace
LINE 302: again, the long ceremony over, she was asked how she was, "I am very
LINE 303: tired, but very happy," she said.
LINE 304: III
LINE 305: And so, after the toils and tempests of the day, a long evening
LINE 306: followed--mild, serene, and lighted with a golden glory. For an
LINE 307: unexampled atmosphere of success and adoration invested the last period
LINE 308: of Victoria's life. Her triumph was the summary, the crown, of a greater
LINE 309: triumph--the culminating prosperity of a nation. The solid splendour of
LINE 310: the decade between Victoria's two jubilees can hardly be paralleled in
LINE 311: the annals of England. The sage counsels of Lord Salisbury seemed to
LINE 312: bring with them not only wealth and power, but security; and the country
LINE 313: settled down, with calm assurance, to the enjoyment of an established
LINE 314: grandeur. And--it was only natural--Victoria settled down too. For
LINE 315: she was a part of the establishment--an essential part as it seemed--a
LINE 316: fixture--a magnificent, immovable sideboard in the huge saloon of
LINE 317: state. Without her the heaped-up banquet of 1890 would have lost
LINE 318: its distinctive quality--the comfortable order of the substantial
LINE 319: unambiguous dishes, with their background of weighty glamour, half out
LINE 320: of sight.
LINE 321: Her own existence came to harmonise more and more with what was around
LINE 322: her. Gradually, imperceptibly, Albert receded. It was not that he was
LINE 323: forgotten--that would have been impossible--but that the void created
LINE 324: by his absence grew less agonising, and even, at last, less obvious.
LINE 325: At last Victoria found it possible to regret the bad weather without
LINE 326: immediately reflecting that her "dear Albert always said we could not
LINE 327: alter it, but must leave it as it was;" she could even enjoy a good
LINE 328: breakfast without considering how "dear Albert" would have liked the
LINE 329: buttered eggs. And, as that figure slowly faded, its place was taken,
LINE 330: inevitably, by Victoria's own. Her being, revolving for so many years
LINE 331: round an external object, now changed its motion and found its centre
LINE 332: in itself. It had to be so: her domestic position, the pressure of
LINE 333: her public work, her indomitable sense of duty, made anything else
LINE 334: impossible. Her egotism proclaimed its rights. Her age increased still
LINE 335: further the surrounding deference; and her force of character, emerging
LINE 336: at length in all its plenitude, imposed absolutely upon its environment
LINE 337: by the conscious effort of an imperious will.
LINE 338: Little by little it was noticed that the outward vestiges of Albert's
LINE 339: posthumous domination grew less complete. At Court the stringency of
LINE 340: mourning was relaxed. As the Queen drove through the Park in her open
LINE 341: carriage with her Highlanders behind her, nursery-maids canvassed
LINE 342: eagerly the growing patch of violet velvet in the bonnet with its jet
LINE 343: appurtenances on the small bowing head.
LINE 344: It was in her family that Victoria's ascendancy reached its highest
LINE 345: point. All her offspring were married; the number of her descendants
LINE 346: rapidly increased; there were many marriages in the third generation;
LINE 347: and no fewer than thirty-seven of her great-grandchildren were living at
LINE 348: the time of her death. A picture of the period displays the royal family
LINE 349: collected together in one of the great rooms at Windsor--a crowded
LINE 350: company of more than fifty persons, with the imperial matriarch in
LINE 351: their midst. Over them all she ruled with a most potent sway. The small
LINE 352: concerns of the youngest aroused her passionate interest; and the oldest
LINE 353: she treated as if they were children still. The Prince of Wales, in
LINE 354: particular, stood in tremendous awe of his mother. She had steadily
LINE 355: refused to allow him the slightest participation in the business of
LINE 356: government; and he had occupied himself in other ways. Nor could it
LINE 357: be denied that he enjoyed himself--out of her sight; but, in that
LINE 358: redoubtable presence, his abounding manhood suffered a miserable
LINE 359: eclipse. Once, at Osborne, when, owing to no fault of his, he was too
LINE 360: late for a dinner party, he was observed standing behind a pillar and
LINE 361: wiping the sweat from his forehead, trying to nerve himself to go up to
LINE 362: the Queen. When at last he did so, she gave him a stiff nod, whereupon
LINE 363: he vanished immediately behind another pillar, and remained there until
LINE 364: the party broke up. At the time of this incident the Prince of Wales was
LINE 365: over fifty years of age.
LINE 366: It was inevitable that the Queen's domestic activities should
LINE 367: occasionally trench upon the domain of high diplomacy; and this was
LINE 368: especially the case when the interests of her eldest daughter, the
LINE 369: Crown Princess of Prussia, were at stake. The Crown Prince held liberal
LINE 370: opinions; he was much influenced by his wife; and both were detested by
LINE 371: Bismarck, who declared with scurrilous emphasis that the Englishwoman
LINE 372: and her mother were a menace to the Prussian State. The feud was still
LINE 373: further intensified when, on the death of the old Emperor (1888), the
LINE 374: Crown Prince succeeded to the throne. A family entanglement brought on
LINE 375: a violent crisis. One of the daughters of the new Empress had become
LINE 376: betrothed to Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who had lately been
LINE 377: ejected from the throne of Bulgaria owing to the hostility of the Tsar.
LINE 378: Victoria, as well as the Empress, highly approved of the match. Of the
LINE 379: two brothers of Prince Alexander, the elder had married another of her
LINE 380: grand-daughters, and the younger was the husband of her daughter, the
LINE 381: Princess Beatrice; she was devoted to the handsome young man; and she
LINE 382: was delighted by the prospect of the third brother--on the whole the
LINE 383: handsomest, she thought, of the three--also becoming a member of her
LINE 384: family. Unfortunately, however, Bismarck was opposed to the scheme.
LINE 385: He perceived that the marriage would endanger the friendship between
LINE 386: Germany and Russia, which was vital to his foreign policy, and he
LINE 387: announced that it must not take place. A fierce struggle between the
LINE 388: Empress and the Chancellor followed. Victoria, whose hatred of her
LINE 389: daughter's enemy was unbounded, came over to Charlottenburg to join in
LINE 390: the fray. Bismarck, over his pipe and lager, snorted out his alarm. The
LINE 391: Queen of England's object, he said, was clearly political--she wished to
LINE 392: estrange Germany and Russia--and very likely she would have her way. "In
LINE 393: family matters," he added, "she is not used to contradiction;" she would
LINE 394: "bring the parson with her in her travelling bag and the bridegroom in
LINE 395: her trunk, and the marriage would come off on the spot." But the man
LINE 396: of blood and iron was not to be thwarted so easily, and he asked for a
LINE 397: private interview with the Queen. The details of their conversation are
LINE 398: unknown; but it is certain that in the course of it Victoria was forced
LINE 399: to realise the meaning of resistance to that formidable personage, and
LINE 400: that she promised to use all her influence to prevent the marriage. The
LINE 401: engagement was broken off; and in the following year Prince Alexander of
LINE 402: Battenberg united himself to Fraulein Loisinger, an actress at the court
LINE 403: theatre of Darmstad.
LINE 404: But such painful incidents were rare. Victoria was growing very old;
LINE 405: with no Albert to guide her, with no Beaconsfield to enflame her, she
LINE 406: was willing enough to abandon the dangerous questions of diplomacy
LINE 407: to the wisdom of Lord Salisbury, and to concentrate her energies upon
LINE 408: objects which touched her more nearly and over which she could
LINE 409: exercise an undisputed control. Her home--her court--the monuments
LINE 410: at Balmoral--the livestock at Windsor--the organisation of her
LINE 411: engagements--the supervision of the multitudinous details of her daily
LINE 412: routine--such matters played now an even greater part in her existence
LINE 413: than before. Her life passed in an extraordinary exactitude. Every
LINE 414: moment of her day was mapped out beforehand; the succession of her
LINE 415: engagements was immutably fixed; the dates of her journeys--to Osborne,
LINE 416: to Balmoral, to the South of France, to Windsor, to London--were hardly
LINE 417: altered from year to year. She demanded from those who surrounded her
LINE 418: a rigid precision in details, and she was preternaturally quick in
LINE 419: detecting the slightest deviation from the rules which she had laid
LINE 420: down. Such was the irresistible potency of her personality, that
LINE 421: anything but the most implicit obedience to her wishes was felt to be
LINE 422: impossible; but sometimes somebody was unpunctual; and unpunctuality
LINE 423: was one of the most heinous of sins. Then her displeasure--her dreadful
LINE 424: displeasure--became all too visible. At such moments there seemed
LINE 425: nothing surprising in her having been the daughter of a martinet.
LINE 426: But these storms, unnerving as they were while they lasted, were quickly
LINE 427: over, and they grew more and more exceptional. With the return of
LINE 428: happiness a gentle benignity flowed from the aged Queen. Her smile, once
LINE 429: so rare a visitant to those saddened features, flitted over them with an
LINE 430: easy alacrity; the blue eyes beamed; the whole face, starting suddenly
LINE 431: from its pendulous expressionlessness, brightened and softened and cast
LINE 432: over those who watched it an unforgettable charm. For in her last years
LINE 433: there was a fascination in Victoria's amiability which had been lacking
LINE 434: even from the vivid impulse of her youth. Over all who approached
LINE 435: her--or very nearly all--she threw a peculiar spell. Her grandchildren
LINE 436: adored her; her ladies waited upon her with a reverential love. The
LINE 437: honour of serving her obliterated a thousand inconveniences--the
LINE 438: monotony of a court existence, the fatigue of standing, the necessity
LINE 439: for a superhuman attentiveness to the minutia: of time and space. As one
LINE 440: did one's wonderful duty one could forget that one's legs were aching
LINE 441: from the infinitude of the passages at Windsor, or that one's bare arms
LINE 442: were turning blue in the Balmoral cold.
LINE 443: What, above all, seemed to make such service delightful was the detailed
LINE 444: interest which the Queen took in the circumstances of those around
LINE 445: her. Her absorbing passion for the comfortable commonplaces, the small
LINE 446: crises, the recurrent sentimentalities, of domestic life constantly
LINE 447: demanded wider fields for its activity; the sphere of her own family,
LINE 448: vast as it was, was not enough; she became the eager confidante of
LINE 449: the household affairs of her ladies; her sympathies reached out to
LINE 450: the palace domestics; even the housemaids and scullions--so it
LINE 451: appeared--were the objects of her searching inquiries, and of her
LINE 452: heartfelt solicitude when their lovers were ordered to a foreign
LINE 453: station, or their aunts suffered from an attack of rheumatism which was
LINE 454: more than usually acute.
LINE 455: Nevertheless the due distinctions of rank were immaculately preserved.
LINE 456: The Queen's mere presence was enough to ensure that; but, in addition,
LINE 457: the dominion of court etiquette was paramount. For that elaborate code,
LINE 458: which had kept Lord Melbourne stiff upon the sofa and ranged the other
LINE 459: guests in silence about the round table according to the order of
LINE 460: precedence, was as punctiliously enforced as ever. Every evening after
LINE 461: dinner, the hearth-rug, sacred to royalty, loomed before the profane in
LINE 462: inaccessible glory, or, on one or two terrific occasions, actually lured
LINE 463: them magnetically forward to the very edge of the abyss. The Queen, at
LINE 464: the fitting moment, moved towards her guests; one after the other they
LINE 465: were led up to her; and, while dialogue followed dialogue in constraint
LINE 466: and embarrassment, the rest of the assembly stood still, without a word.
LINE 467: Only in one particular was the severity of the etiquette allowed to
LINE 468: lapse. Throughout the greater part of the reign the rule that ministers
LINE 469: must stand during their audiences with the Queen had been absolute. When
LINE 470: Lord Derby, the Prime Minister, had an audience of Her Majesty after
LINE 471: a serious illness, he mentioned it afterwards, as a proof of the royal
LINE 472: favour, that the Queen had remarked "How sorry she was she could not ask
LINE 473: him to be seated." Subsequently, Disraeli, after an attack of gout
LINE 474: and in a moment of extreme expansion on the part of Victoria, had
LINE 475: been offered a chair; but he had thought it wise humbly to decline the
LINE 476: privilege. In her later years, however, the Queen invariably asked Mr.
LINE 477: Gladstone and Lord Salisbury to sit down.
LINE 478: Sometimes the solemnity of the evening was diversified by a concert, an
LINE 479: opera, or even a play. One of the most marked indications of
LINE 480: Victoria's enfranchisement from the thraldom of widowhood had been
LINE 481: her resumption--after an interval of thirty years--of the custom of
LINE 482: commanding dramatic companies from London to perform before the Court at
LINE 483: Windsor. On such occasions her spirits rose high. She loved acting; she
LINE 484: loved a good plot; above all, she loved a farce. Engrossed by everything
LINE 485: that passed upon the stage she would follow, with childlike innocence,
LINE 486: the unwinding of the story; or she would assume an air of knowing
LINE 487: superiority and exclaim in triumph, "There! You didn't expect that, did
LINE 488: you?" when the denouement came. Her sense of humour was of a vigorous
LINE 489: though primitive kind. She had been one of the very few persons who had
LINE 490: always been able to appreciate the Prince Consort's jokes; and, when
LINE 491: those were cracked no more, she could still roar with laughter, in the
LINE 492: privacy of her household, over some small piece of fun--some oddity of
LINE 493: an ambassador, or some ignorant Minister's faux pas. When the jest grew
LINE 494: subtle she was less pleased; but, if it approached the confines of the
LINE 495: indecorous, the danger was serious. To take a liberty called down at
LINE 496: once Her Majesty's most crushing disapprobation; and to say something
LINE 497: improper was to take the greatest liberty of all. Then the royal
LINE 498: lips sank down at the corners, the royal eyes stared in astonished
LINE 499: protrusion, and in fact, the royal countenance became inauspicious in
LINE 500: the highest degree. The transgressor shuddered into silence, while the
LINE 501: awful "We are not amused" annihilated the dinner table. Afterwards,
LINE 502: in her private entourage, the Queen would observe that the person in
LINE 503: question was, she very much feared, "not discreet"; it was a verdict
LINE 504: from which there was no appeal.
LINE 505: In general, her aesthetic tastes had remained unchanged since the days
LINE 506: of Mendelssohn, Landseer, and Lablache. She still delighted in the
LINE 507: roulades of Italian opera; she still demanded a high standard in the
LINE 508: execution of a pianoforte duet. Her views on painting were decided;
LINE 509: Sir Edwin, she declared, was perfect; she was much impressed by Lord
LINE 510: Leighton's manners; and she profoundly distrusted Mr. Watts. From time
LINE 511: to time she ordered engraved portraits to be taken of members of
LINE 512: the royal family; on these occasions she would have the first proofs
LINE 513: submitted to her, and, having inspected them with minute particularity,
LINE 514: she would point out their mistakes to the artists, indicating at the
LINE 515: same time how they might be corrected. The artists invariably discovered
LINE 516: that Her Majesty's suggestions were of the highest value. In literature
LINE 517: her interests were more restricted. She was devoted to Lord Tennyson;
LINE 518: and, as the Prince Consort had admired George Eliot, she perused
LINE 519: "Middlemarch:" she was disappointed. There is reason to believe,
LINE 520: however, that the romances of another female writer, whose popularity
LINE 521: among the humbler classes of Her Majesty's subjects was at one time
LINE 522: enormous, secured, no less, the approval of Her Majesty. Otherwise she
LINE 523: did not read very much.
LINE 524: Once, however, the Queen's attention was drawn to a publication which it
LINE 525: was impossible for her to ignore. "The Greville Memoirs," filled with a
LINE 526: mass of historical information of extraordinary importance, but filled
LINE 527: also with descriptions, which were by no means flattering, of George
LINE 528: IV, William IV, and other royal persons, was brought out by Mr. Reeve.
LINE 529: Victoria read the book, and was appalled. It was, she declared, a
LINE 530: "dreadful and really scandalous book," and she could not say "how
LINE 531: HORRIFIED and INDIGNANT" she was at Greville's "indiscretion,
LINE 532: indelicacy, ingratitude towards friends, betrayal of confidence and
LINE 533: shameful disloyalty towards his Sovereign." She wrote to Disraeli to
LINE 534: tell him that in her opinion it was "VERY IMPORTANT that the book should
LINE 535: be severely censured and discredited." "The tone in which he speaks of
LINE 536: royalty," she added, "is unlike anything one sees in history even,
LINE 537: and is most reprehensible." Her anger was directed with almost equal
LINE 538: vehemence against Mr. Reeve for his having published "such an abominable
LINE 539: book," and she charged Sir Arthur Helps to convey to him her deep
LINE 540: displeasure. Mr. Reeve, however, was impenitent. When Sir Arthur told
LINE 541: him that, in the Queen's opinion, "the book degraded royalty," he
LINE 542: replied: "Not at all; it elevates it by the contrast it offers between
LINE 543: the present and the defunct state of affairs." But this adroit defence
LINE 544: failed to make any impression upon Victoria; and Mr. Reeve, when he
LINE 545: retired from the public service, did not receive the knighthood which
LINE 546: custom entitled him to expect. Perhaps if the Queen had known how many
LINE 547: caustic comments upon herself Mr. Reeve had quietly suppressed in the
LINE 548: published Memoirs, she would have been almost grateful to him; but, in
LINE 549: that case, what would she have said of Greville? Imagination boggles at
LINE 550: the thought. As for more modern essays upon the same topic, Her Majesty,
LINE 551: it is to be feared, would have characterised them as "not discreet."
LINE 552: But as a rule the leisure hours of that active life were occupied with
LINE 553: recreations of a less intangible quality than the study of literature or
LINE 554: the appreciation of art. Victoria was a woman not only of vast property
LINE 555: but of innumerable possessions. She had inherited an immense quantity
LINE 556: of furniture, of ornaments, of china, of plate, of valuable objects of
LINE 557: every kind; her purchases, throughout a long life, made a formidable
LINE 558: addition to these stores; and there flowed in upon her, besides, from
LINE 559: every quarter of the globe, a constant stream of gifts. Over this
LINE 560: enormous mass she exercised an unceasing and minute supervision, and the
LINE 561: arrangement and the contemplation of it, in all its details, filled her
LINE 562: with an intimate satisfaction. The collecting instinct has its roots in
LINE 563: the very depths of human nature; and, in the case of Victoria, it seemed
LINE 564: to owe its force to two of her dominating impulses--the intense sense,
LINE 565: which had always been hers, of her own personality, and the craving
LINE 566: which, growing with the years, had become in her old age almost an
LINE 567: obsession, for fixity, for solidity, for the setting up of palpable
LINE 568: barriers against the outrages of change and time. When she considered
LINE 569: the multitudinous objects which belonged to her, or, better still, when,
LINE 570: choosing out some section of them as the fancy took her, she actually
LINE 571: savoured the vivid richness of their individual qualities, she saw
LINE 572: herself deliciously reflected from a million facets, felt herself
LINE 573: magnified miraculously over a boundless area, and was well pleased.
LINE 574: That was just as it should be; but then came the dismaying
LINE 575: thought--everything slips away, crumbles, vanishes; Sevres
LINE 576: dinner-services get broken; even golden basins go unaccountably astray;
LINE 577: even one's self, with all the recollections and experiences that make
LINE 578: up one's being, fluctuates, perishes, dissolves... But no! It could
LINE 579: not, should not be so! There should be no changes and no losses! Nothing
LINE 580: should ever move--neither the past nor the present--and she herself
LINE 581: least of all! And so the tenacious woman, hoarding her valuables,
LINE 582: decreed their immortality with all the resolution of her soul. She would
LINE 583: not lose one memory or one pin.
LINE 584: She gave orders that nothing should be thrown away--and nothing was.
LINE 585: There, in drawer after drawer, in wardrobe after wardrobe, reposed the
LINE 586: dresses of seventy years. But not only the dresses--the furs and the
LINE 587: mantles and subsidiary frills and the muffs and the parasols and the
LINE 588: bonnets--all were ranged in chronological order, dated and complete. A
LINE 589: great cupboard was devoted to the dolls; in the china room at Windsor a
LINE 590: special table held the mugs of her childhood, and her children's mugs as
LINE 591: well. Mementoes of the past surrounded her in serried accumulations.
LINE 592: In every room the tables were powdered thick with the photographs of
LINE 593: relatives; their portraits, revealing them at all ages, covered the
LINE 594: walls; their figures, in solid marble, rose up from pedestals, or
LINE 595: gleamed from brackets in the form of gold and silver statuettes. The
LINE 596: dead, in every shape--in miniatures, in porcelain, in enormous life-size
LINE 597: oil-paintings--were perpetually about her. John Brown stood upon her
LINE 598: writing-table in solid gold. Her favourite horses and dogs, endowed with
LINE 599: a new durability, crowded round her footsteps. Sharp, in silver gilt,
LINE 600: dominated the dinner table; Boy and Boz lay together among unfading
LINE 601: flowers, in bronze. And it was not enough that each particle of the
LINE 602: past should be given the stability of metal or of marble: the whole
LINE 603: collection, in its arrangement, no less than its entity, should be
LINE 604: immutably fixed. There might be additions, but there might never be
LINE 605: alterations. No chintz might change, no carpet, no curtain, be replaced
LINE 606: by another; or, if long use at last made it necessary, the stuffs and
LINE 607: the patterns must be so identically reproduced that the keenest eye
LINE 608: might not detect the difference. No new picture could be hung upon the
LINE 609: walls at Windsor, for those already there had been put in their places
LINE 610: by Albert, whose decisions were eternal. So, indeed, were Victoria's.
LINE 611: To ensure that they should be the aid of the camera was called in. Every
LINE 612: single article in the Queen's possession was photographed from several
LINE 613: points of view. These photographs were submitted to Her Majesty, and
LINE 614: when, after careful inspection, she had approved of them, they were
LINE 615: placed in a series of albums, richly bound. Then, opposite each
LINE 616: photograph, an entry was made, indicating the number of the article, the
LINE 617: number of the room in which it was kept, its exact position in the room
LINE 618: and all its principal characteristics. The fate of every object which
LINE 619: had undergone this process was henceforth irrevocably sealed. The
LINE 620: whole multitude, once and for all, took up its steadfast station. And
LINE 621: Victoria, with a gigantic volume or two of the endless catalogue always
LINE 622: beside her, to look through, to ponder upon, to expatiate over, could
LINE 623: feel, with a double contentment, that the transitoriness of this world
LINE 624: had been arrested by the amplitude of her might.
LINE 625: Thus the collection, ever multiplying, ever encroaching upon new fields
LINE 626: of consciousness, ever rooting itself more firmly in the depths of
LINE 627: instinct, became one of the dominating influences of that strange
LINE 628: existence. It was a collection not merely of things and of thoughts,
LINE 629: but of states of mind and ways of living as well. The celebration of
LINE 630: anniversaries grew to be an important branch of it--of birthdays and
LINE 631: marriage days and death days, each of which demanded its appropriate
LINE 632: feeling, which, in its turn, must be itself expressed in an appropriate
LINE 633: outward form. And the form, of course--the ceremony of rejoicing
LINE 634: or lamentation--was stereotyped with the rest: it was part of the
LINE 635: collection. On a certain day, for instance, flowers must be strewn on
LINE 636: John Brown's monument at Balmoral; and the date of the yearly departure
LINE 637: for Scotland was fixed by that fact. Inevitably it was around the
LINE 638: central circumstance of death--death, the final witness to human
LINE 639: mutability--that these commemorative cravings clustered most thickly.
LINE 640: Might not even death itself be humbled, if one could recall enough--if
LINE 641: one asserted, with a sufficiently passionate and reiterated emphasis,
LINE 642: the eternity of love? Accordingly, every bed in which Victoria slept had
LINE 643: attached to it, at the back, on the right-hand side, above the pillow,
LINE 644: a photograph of the head and shoulders of Albert as he lay dead,
LINE 645: surmounted by a wreath of immortelles. At Balmoral, where memories came
LINE 646: crowding so closely, the solid signs of memory appeared in surprising
LINE 647: profusion. Obelisks, pyramids, tombs, statues, cairns, and seats of
LINE 648: inscribed granite, proclaimed Victoria's dedication to the dead. There,
LINE 649: twice a year, on the days that followed her arrival, a solemn
LINE 650: pilgrimage of inspection and meditation was performed. There, on August
LINE 651: 26--Albert's birthday--at the foot of the bronze statue of him in
LINE 652: Highland dress, the Queen, her family, her Court, her servants, and her
LINE 653: tenantry, met together and in silence drank to the memory of the dead.
LINE 654: In England the tokens of remembrance pullulated hardly less. Not a
LINE 655: day passed without some addition to the multifold assemblage--a gold
LINE 656: statuette of Ross, the piper--a life-sized marble group of Victoria and
LINE 657: Albert, in medieval costume, inscribed upon the base with the words:
LINE 658: "Allured to brighter worlds and led the way-" a granite slab in the
LINE 659: shrubbery at Osborne, informing the visitor of "Waldmann: the very
LINE 660: favourite little dachshund of Queen Victoria; who brought him from
LINE 661: Baden, April 1872; died, July 11, 1881."
LINE 662: At Frogmore, the great mausoleum, perpetually enriched, was visited
LINE 663: almost daily by the Queen when the Court was at Windsor. But there was
LINE 664: another, a more secret and a hardly less holy shrine. The suite of rooms
LINE 665: which Albert had occupied in the Castle was kept for ever shut away
LINE 666: from the eyes of any save the most privileged. Within those precincts
LINE 667: everything remained as it had been at the Prince's death; but the
LINE 668: mysterious preoccupation of Victoria had commanded that her husband's
LINE 669: clothing should be laid afresh, each evening, upon the bed, and that,
LINE 670: each evening, the water should be set ready in the basin, as if he were
LINE 671: still alive; and this incredible rite was performed with scrupulous
LINE 672: regularity for nearly forty years.
LINE 673: Such was the inner worship; and still the flesh obeyed the spirit; still
LINE 674: the daily hours of labour proclaimed Victoria's consecration to duty
LINE 675: and to the ideal of the dead. Yet, with the years, the sense of
LINE 676: self-sacrifice faded; the natural energies of that ardent being
LINE 677: discharged themselves with satisfaction into the channel of public work;
LINE 678: the love of business which, from her girlhood, had been strong within
LINE 679: her, reasserted itself in all its vigour, and, in her old age, to
LINE 680: have been cut off from her papers and her boxes would have been, not a
LINE 681: relief, but an agony to Victoria. Thus, though toiling Ministers might
LINE 682: sigh and suffer, the whole process of government continued, till the
LINE 683: very end, to pass before her. Nor was that all; ancient precedent
LINE 684: had made the validity of an enormous number of official transactions
LINE 685: dependent upon the application of the royal sign-manual; and a great
LINE 686: proportion of the Queen's working hours was spent in this mechanical
LINE 687: task. Nor did she show any desire to diminish it. On the contrary, she
LINE 688: voluntarily resumed the duty of signing commissions in the army, from
LINE 689: which she had been set free by Act of Parliament, and from which,
LINE 690: during the years of middle life, she had abstained. In no case would she
LINE 691: countenance the proposal that she should use a stamp. But, at last, when
LINE 692: the increasing pressure of business made the delays of the antiquated
LINE 693: system intolerable, she consented that, for certain classes of
LINE 694: documents, her oral sanction should be sufficient. Each paper was read
LINE 695: aloud to her, and she said at the end "Approved." Often, for hours at a
LINE 696: time, she would sit, with Albert's bust in front of her, while the word
LINE 697: "Approved" issued at intervals from her lips. The word came forth with
LINE 698: a majestic sonority; for her voice now--how changed from the silvery
LINE 699: treble of her girlhood--was a contralto, full and strong.
LINE 700: IV
LINE 701: The final years were years of apotheosis. In the dazzled imagination
LINE 702: of her subjects Victoria soared aloft towards the regions of divinity
LINE 703: through a nimbus of purest glory. Criticism fell dumb; deficiencies
LINE 704: which, twenty years earlier, would have been universally admitted, were
LINE 705: now as universally ignored. That the nation's idol was a very incomplete
LINE 706: representative of the nation was a circumstance that was hardly noticed,
LINE 707: and yet it was conspicuously true. For the vast changes which, out of
LINE 708: the England of 1837, had produced the England of 1897, seemed scarcely
LINE 709: to have touched the Queen. The immense industrial development of the
LINE 710: period, the significance of which had been so thoroughly understood
LINE 711: by Albert, meant little indeed to Victoria. The amazing scientific
LINE 712: movement, which Albert had appreciated no less, left Victoria perfectly
LINE 713: cold. Her conception of the universe, and of man's place in it, and of
LINE 714: the stupendous problems of nature and philosophy remained, throughout
LINE 715: her life, entirely unchanged. Her religion was the religion which she
LINE 716: had learnt from the Baroness Lehzen and the Duchess of Kent. Here, too,
LINE 717: it might have been supposed that Albert's views might have influenced
LINE 718: her. For Albert, in matters of religion, was advanced. Disbelieving
LINE 719: altogether in evil spirits, he had had his doubts about the miracle
LINE 720: of the Gaderene Swine. Stockmar, even, had thrown out, in a remarkable
LINE 721: memorandum on the education of the Prince of Wales, the suggestion that
LINE 722: while the child "must unquestionably be brought up in the creed of the
LINE 723: Church of England," it might nevertheless be in accordance with
LINE 724: the spirit of the times to exclude from his religious training the
LINE 725: inculcation of a belief in "the supernatural doctrines of Christianity."
LINE 726: This, however, would have been going too far; and all the royal children
LINE 727: were brought up in complete orthodoxy. Anything else would have grieved
LINE 728: Victoria, though her own conceptions of the orthodox were not very
LINE 729: precise. But her nature, in which imagination and subtlety held so small
LINE 730: a place, made her instinctively recoil from the intricate ecstasies
LINE 731: of High Anglicanism; and she seemed to feel most at home in the simple
LINE 732: faith of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. This was what might have
LINE 733: been expected; for Lehzen was the daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and the
LINE 734: Lutherans and the Presbyterians have much in common. For many years Dr.
LINE 735: Norman Macleod, an innocent Scotch minister, was her principal spiritual
LINE 736: adviser; and, when he was taken from her, she drew much comfort from
LINE 737: quiet chats about life and death with the cottagers at Balmoral.
LINE 738: Her piety, absolutely genuine, found what it wanted in the sober
LINE 739: exhortations of old John Grant and the devout saws of Mrs. P.
LINE 740: Farquharson. They possessed the qualities, which, as a child of
LINE 741: fourteen, she had so sincerely admired in the Bishop of Chester's
LINE 742: "Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew;" they were "just plain and
LINE 743: comprehensible and full of truth and good feeling." The Queen, who gave
LINE 744: her name to the Age of Mill and of Darwin, never got any further than
LINE 745: that.
LINE 746: From the social movements of her time Victoria was equally remote.
LINE 747: Towards the smallest no less than towards the greatest changes she
LINE 748: remained inflexible. During her youth and middle age smoking had been
LINE 749: forbidden in polite society, and so long as she lived she would not
LINE 750: withdraw her anathema against it. Kings might protest; bishops and
LINE 751: ambassadors, invited to Windsor, might be reduced, in the privacy of
LINE 752: their bedrooms, to lie full-length upon the floor and smoke up the
LINE 753: chimney--the interdict continued! It might have been supposed that a
LINE 754: female sovereign would have lent her countenance to one of the most
LINE 755: vital of all the reforms to which her epoch gave birth--the emancipation
LINE 756: of women--but, on the contrary, the mere mention of such a proposal sent
LINE 757: the blood rushing to her head. In 1870, her eye having fallen upon the
LINE 758: report of a meeting in favour of Women's Suffrage, she wrote to Mr.
LINE 759: Martin in royal rage--"The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone
LINE 760: who can speak or write to join in checking this mad, wicked folly of
LINE 761: 'Woman's Rights,' with all its attendant horrors, on which her poor
LINE 762: feeble sex is bent, forgetting every sense of womanly feeling and
LINE 763: propriety. Lady--ought to get a GOOD WHIPPING. It is a subject which
LINE 764: makes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself. God
LINE 765: created men and women different--then let them remain each in their own
LINE 766: position. Tennyson has some beautiful lines on the difference of men and
LINE 767: women in 'The Princess.' Woman would become the most hateful, heartless,
LINE 768: and disgusting of human beings were she allowed to unsex herself; and
LINE 769: where would be the protection which man was intended to give the weaker
LINE 770: sex? The Queen is sure that Mrs. Martin agrees with her." The argument
LINE 771: was irrefutable; Mrs. Martin agreed; and yet the canker spread.
LINE 772: In another direction Victoria's comprehension of the spirit of her age
LINE 773: has been constantly asserted. It was for long the custom for courtly
LINE 774: historians and polite politicians to compliment the Queen upon the
LINE 775: correctness of her attitude towards the Constitution. But such praises
LINE 776: seem hardly to be justified by the facts. In her later years Victoria
LINE 777: more than once alluded with regret to her conduct during the Bedchamber
LINE 778: crisis, and let it be understood that she had grown wiser since. Yet
LINE 779: in truth it is difficult to trace any fundamental change either in her
LINE 780: theory or her practice in constitutional matters throughout her life.
LINE 781: The same despotic and personal spirit which led her to break off the
LINE 782: negotiations with Peel is equally visible in her animosity towards
LINE 783: Palmerston, in her threats of abdication to Disraeli, and in her desire
LINE 784: to prosecute the Duke of Westminster for attending a meeting upon
LINE 785: Bulgarian atrocities. The complex and delicate principles of the
LINE 786: Constitution cannot be said to have come within the compass of her
LINE 787: mental faculties; and in the actual developments which it underwent
LINE 788: during her reign she played a passive part. From 1840 to 1861 the
LINE 789: power of the Crown steadily increased in England; from 1861 to 1901 it
LINE 790: steadily declined. The first process was due to the influence of the
LINE 791: Prince Consort, the second to that of a series of great Ministers.
LINE 792: During the first Victoria was in effect a mere accessory; during the
LINE 793: second the threads of power, which Albert had so laboriously collected,
LINE 794: inevitably fell from her hands into the vigorous grasp of Mr. Gladstone,
LINE 795: Lord Beaconsfield, and Lord Salisbury. Perhaps, absorbed as she was in
LINE 796: routine, and difficult as she found it to distinguish at all clearly
LINE 797: between the trivial and the essential, she was only dimly aware of what
LINE 798: was happening. Yet, at the end of her reign, the Crown was weaker than
LINE 799: at any other time in English history. Paradoxically enough, Victoria
LINE 800: received the highest eulogiums for assenting to a political evolution,
LINE 801: which, had she completely realised its import, would have filled her
LINE 802: with supreme displeasure.
LINE 803: Nevertheless it must not be supposed that she was a second George III.
LINE 804: Her desire to impose her will, vehement as it was, and unlimited by any
LINE 805: principle, was yet checked by a certain shrewdness. She might oppose
LINE 806: her Ministers with extraordinary violence, she might remain utterly
LINE 807: impervious to arguments and supplications; the pertinacity of her
LINE 808: resolution might seem to be unconquerable; but, at the very last moment
LINE 809: of all, her obstinacy would give way. Her innate respect and capacity
LINE 810: for business, and perhaps, too, the memory of Albert's scrupulous
LINE 811: avoidance of extreme courses, prevented her from ever entering an
LINE 812: impasse. By instinct she understood when the facts were too much for
LINE 813: her, and to them she invariably yielded. After all, what else could she
LINE 814: do?
LINE 815: But if, in all these ways, the Queen and her epoch were profoundly
LINE 816: separated, the points of contact between them also were not few.
LINE 817: Victoria understood very well the meaning and the attractions of power
LINE 818: and property, and in such learning the English nation, too, had grown
LINE 819: to be more and more proficient. During the last fifteen years of the
LINE 820: reign--for the short Liberal Administration of 1892 was a mere interlude
LINE 821: imperialism was the dominant creed of the country. It was Victoria's
LINE 822: as well. In this direction, if in no other, she had allowed her mind to
LINE 823: develop. Under Disraeli's tutelage the British Dominions over the seas
LINE 824: had come to mean much more to her than ever before, and, in particular,
LINE 825: she had grown enamoured of the East. The thought of India fascinated
LINE 826: her; she set to, and learnt a little Hindustani; she engaged some Indian
LINE 827: servants, who became her inseparable attendants, and one of whom, Munshi
LINE 828: Abdul Karim, eventually almost succeeded to the position which had
LINE 829: once been John Brown's. At the same time, the imperialist temper of the
LINE 830: nation invested her office with a new significance exactly harmonising
LINE 831: with her own inmost proclivities. The English polity was in the main
LINE 832: a common-sense structure, but there was always a corner in it where
LINE 833: common-sense could not enter--where, somehow or other, the ordinary
LINE 834: measurements were not applicable and the ordinary rules did not apply.
LINE 835: So our ancestors had laid it down, giving scope, in their wisdom, to
LINE 836: that mystical element which, as it seems, can never quite be eradicated
LINE 837: from the affairs of men. Naturally it was in the Crown that the
LINE 838: mysticism of the English polity was concentrated--the Crown, with its
LINE 839: venerable antiquity, its sacred associations, its imposing spectacular
LINE 840: array. But, for nearly two centuries, common-sense had been predominant
LINE 841: in the great building, and the little, unexplored, inexplicable corner
LINE 842: had attracted small attention. Then, with the rise of imperialism, there
LINE 843: was a change. For imperialism is a faith as well as a business; as
LINE 844: it grew, the mysticism in English public life grew with it; and
LINE 845: simultaneously a new importance began to attach to the Crown. The
LINE 846: need for a symbol--a symbol of England's might, of England's worth,
LINE 847: of England's extraordinary and mysterious destiny--became felt more
LINE 848: urgently than ever before. The Crown was that symbol: and the Crown
LINE 849: rested upon the head of Victoria. Thus it happened that while by the end
LINE 850: of the reign the power of the sovereign had appreciably diminished, the
LINE 851: prestige of the sovereign had enormously grown.
LINE 852: Yet this prestige was not merely the outcome of public changes; it was
LINE 853: an intensely personal matter, too. Victoria was the Queen of England,
LINE 854: the Empress of India, the quintessential pivot round which the whole
LINE 855: magnificent machine was revolving--but how much more besides! For one
LINE 856: thing, she was of a great age--an almost indispensable qualification for
LINE 857: popularity in England. She had given proof of one of the most admired
LINE 858: characteristics of the race--persistent vitality. She had reigned for
LINE 859: sixty years, and she was not out. And then, she was a character. The
LINE 860: outlines of her nature were firmly drawn, and, even through the mists
LINE 861: which envelop royalty, clearly visible. In the popular imagination her
LINE 862: familiar figure filled, with satisfying ease, a distinct and memorable
LINE 863: place. It was, besides, the kind of figure which naturally called forth
LINE 864: the admiring sympathy of the great majority of the nation. Goodness they
LINE 865: prized above every other human quality; and Victoria, who had said
LINE 866: that she would be good at the age of twelve, had kept her word. Duty,
LINE 867: conscience, morality--yes! in the light of those high beacons the
LINE 868: Queen had always lived. She had passed her days in work and not in
LINE 869: pleasure--in public responsibilities and family cares. The standard
LINE 870: of solid virtue which had been set up so long ago amid the domestic
LINE 871: happiness of Osborne had never been lowered for an instant. For more
LINE 872: than half a century no divorced lady had approached the precincts of the
LINE 873: Court. Victoria, indeed, in her enthusiasm for wifely fidelity, had laid
LINE 874: down a still stricter ordinance: she frowned severely upon any widow
LINE 875: who married again. Considering that she herself was the offspring of
LINE 876: a widow's second marriage, this prohibition might be regarded as an
LINE 877: eccentricity; but, no doubt, it was an eccentricity on the right side.
LINE 878: The middle classes, firm in the triple brass of their respectability,
LINE 879: rejoiced with a special joy over the most respectable of Queens. They
LINE 880: almost claimed her, indeed, as one of themselves; but this would have
LINE 881: been an exaggeration. For, though many of her characteristics were most
LINE 882: often found among the middle classes, in other respects--in her manners,
LINE 883: for instance--Victoria was decidedly aristocratic. And, in one important
LINE 884: particular, she was neither aristocratic nor middle-class: her attitude
LINE 885: toward herself was simply regal.
LINE 886: Such qualities were obvious and important; but, in the impact of a
LINE 887: personality, it is something deeper, something fundamental and common to
LINE 888: all its qualities, that really tells. In Victoria, it is easy to discern
LINE 889: the nature of this underlying element: it was a peculiar sincerity. Her
LINE 890: truthfulness, her single-mindedness, the vividness of her emotions and
LINE 891: her unrestrained expression of them, were the varied forms which this
LINE 892: central characteristic assumed. It was her sincerity which gave her at
LINE 893: once her impressiveness, her charm, and her absurdity. She moved
LINE 894: through life with the imposing certitude of one to whom concealment was
LINE 895: impossible--either towards her surroundings or towards herself. There
LINE 896: she was, all of her--the Queen of England, complete and obvious; the
LINE 897: world might take her or leave her; she had nothing more to show, or to
LINE 898: explain, or to modify; and, with her peerless carriage, she swept along
LINE 899: her path. And not only was concealment out of the question; reticence,
LINE 900: reserve, even dignity itself, as it sometimes seemed, might be very well
LINE 901: dispensed with. As Lady Lyttelton said: "There is a transparency in her
LINE 902: truth that is very striking--not a shade of exaggeration in describing
LINE 903: feelings or facts; like very few other people I ever knew. Many may be
LINE 904: as true, but I think it goes often along with some reserve. She talks
LINE 905: all out; just as it is, no more and no less." She talked all out; and
LINE 906: she wrote all out, too. Her letters, in the surprising jet of their
LINE 907: expression, remind one of a turned-on tap. What is within pours forth
LINE 908: in an immediate, spontaneous rush. Her utterly unliterary style has at
LINE 909: least the merit of being a vehicle exactly suited to her thoughts and
LINE 910: feelings; and even the platitude of her phraseology carries with it a
LINE 911: curiously personal flavour. Undoubtedly it was through her writings that
LINE 912: she touched the heart of the public. Not only in her "Highland Journals"
LINE 913: where the mild chronicle of her private proceedings was laid bare
LINE 914: without a trace either of affectation or of embarrassment, but also in
LINE 915: those remarkable messages to the nation which, from time to time, she
LINE 916: published in the newspapers, her people found her very close to them
LINE 917: indeed. They felt instinctively Victoria's irresistible sincerity, and
LINE 918: they responded. And in truth it was an endearing trait.
LINE 919: The personality and the position, too--the wonderful combination of
LINE 920: them--that, perhaps, was what was finally fascinating in the case. The
LINE 921: little old lady, with her white hair and her plain mourning clothes,
LINE 922: in her wheeled chair or her donkey-carriage--one saw her so; and
LINE 923: then--close behind--with their immediate suggestion of singularity,
LINE 924: of mystery, and of power--the Indian servants. That was the familiar
LINE 925: vision, and it was admirable; but, at chosen moments, it was right that
LINE 926: the widow of Windsor should step forth apparent Queen. The last and the
LINE 927: most glorious of such occasions was the Jubilee of 1897. Then, as
LINE 928: the splendid procession passed along, escorting Victoria through the
LINE 929: thronged re-echoing streets of London on her progress of thanksgiving
LINE 930: to St. Paul's Cathedral, the greatness of her realm and the adoration
LINE 931: of her subjects blazed out together. The tears welled to her eyes, and,
LINE 932: while the multitude roared round her, "How kind they are to me! How kind
LINE 933: they are!" she repeated over and over again. That night her message flew
LINE 934: over the Empire: "From my heart I thank my beloved people. May God bless
LINE 935: them!" The long journey was nearly done. But the traveller, who had
LINE 936: come so far, and through such strange experiences, moved on with the
LINE 937: old unfaltering step. The girl, the wife, the aged woman, were the same:
LINE 938: vitality, conscientiousness, pride, and simplicity were hers to the
LINE 939: latest hour.
