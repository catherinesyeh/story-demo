LINE 2: The weak-willed youth who took no interest in polities and never read a
LINE 3: newspaper had grown into a man of unbending determination whose tireless
LINE 4: energies were incessantly concentrated upon the laborious business of
LINE 5: government and the highest questions of State. He was busy now from
LINE 6: morning till night. In the winter, before the dawn, he was to be
LINE 7: seen, seated at his writing-table, working by the light of the green
LINE 8: reading--lamp which he had brought over with him from Germany, and
LINE 9: the construction of which he had much improved by an ingenious device.
LINE 10: Victoria was early too, but she was not so early as Albert; and when, in
LINE 11: the chill darkness, she took her seat at her own writing-table, placed
LINE 12: side by side with his, she invariably found upon it a neat pile of
LINE 13: papers arranged for her inspection and her signature. The day,
LINE 14: thus begun, continued in unremitting industry. At breakfast, the
LINE 15: newspapers--the once hated newspapers--made their appearance, and the
LINE 16: Prince, absorbed in their perusal, would answer no questions, or, if
LINE 17: an article struck him, would read it aloud. After, that there were
LINE 18: ministers and secretaries to interview; there was a vast correspondence
LINE 19: to be carried on; there were numerous memoranda to be made. Victoria,
LINE 20: treasuring every word, preserving every letter, was all breathless
LINE 21: attention and eager obedience. Sometimes Albert would actually ask her
LINE 22: advice. He consulted her about his English: "Lese recht aufmerksam, und
LINE 23: sage wenn irgend ein Fehler ist,"(*) he would say; or, as he handed
LINE 24: her a draft for her signature, he would observe, "Ich hab' Dir hier ein
LINE 25: Draft gemacht, lese es mal! Ich dachte es ware recht so."(**) Thus the
LINE 26: diligent, scrupulous, absorbing hours passed by. Fewer and fewer grew
LINE 27: the moments of recreation and of exercise. The demands of society were
LINE 28: narrowed down to the smallest limits, and even then but grudgingly
LINE 29: attended to. It was no longer a mere pleasure, it was a positive
LINE 30: necessity, to go to bed as early as possible in order to be up and at
LINE 31: work on the morrow betimes.
LINE 32: (*) "Read this carefully, and tell me if there are any
LINE 33: mistakes in it."
LINE 34: (**) "Here is a draft I have made for you. Read it. I should
LINE 35: think this would do."
LINE 36: The important and exacting business of government, which became at last
LINE 37: the dominating preoccupation in Albert's mind, still left unimpaired
LINE 38: his old tastes and interests; he remained devoted to art, to science,
LINE 39: to philosophy, and a multitude of subsidiary activities showed how his
LINE 40: energies increased as the demands upon them grew. For whenever duty
LINE 41: called, the Prince was all alertness. With indefatigable perseverance he
LINE 42: opened museums, laid the foundation stones of hospitals, made speeches
LINE 43: to the Royal Agricultural Society, and attended meetings of the British
LINE 44: Association. The National Gallery particularly interested him: he drew
LINE 45: up careful regulations for the arrangement of the pictures according to
LINE 46: schools; and he attempted--though in vain--to have the whole collection
LINE 47: transported to South Kensington. Feodora, now the Princess Hohenlohe,
LINE 48: after a visit to England, expressed in a letter to Victoria her
LINE 49: admiration of Albert both as a private and a public character. Nor did
LINE 50: she rely only on her own opinion. "I must just copy out," she said,
LINE 51: "what Mr. Klumpp wrote to me some little time ago, and which is
LINE 52: quite true--'Prince Albert is one of the few Royal personages who can
LINE 53: sacrifice to any principle (as soon as it has become evident to them to
LINE 54: be good and noble) all those notions (or sentiments) to which others,
LINE 55: owing to their narrow-mindedness, or to the prejudices of their rank,
LINE 56: are so thoroughly inclined strongly to cling.' There is something so
LINE 57: truly religious in this," the Princess added, "as well as humane and
LINE 58: just, most soothing to my feelings which are so often hurt and disturbed
LINE 59: by what I hear and see."
LINE 60: Victoria, from the depth of her heart, subscribed to all the eulogies of
LINE 61: Feodora and Mr. Klumpp. She only found that they were insufficient. As
LINE 62: she watched her beloved Albert, after toiling with state documents and
LINE 63: public functions, devoting every spare moment of his time to domestic
LINE 64: duties, to artistic appreciation, and to intellectual improvements; as
LINE 65: she listened to him cracking his jokes at the luncheon table, or playing
LINE 66: Mendelssohn on the organ, or pointing out the merits of Sir Edwin
LINE 67: Landseer's pictures; as she followed him round while he gave
LINE 68: instructions about the breeding of cattle, or decided that the
LINE 69: Gainsboroughs must be hung higher up so that the Winterhalters might be
LINE 70: properly seen--she felt perfectly certain that no other wife had ever
LINE 71: had such a husband. His mind was apparently capable of everything,
LINE 72: and she was hardly surprised to learn that he had made an important
LINE 73: discovery for the conversion of sewage into agricultural manure.
LINE 74: Filtration from below upwards, he explained, through some appropriate
LINE 75: medium, which retained the solids and set free the fluid sewage for
LINE 76: irrigation, was the principle of the scheme. "All previous plans,"
LINE 77: he said, "would have cost millions; mine costs next to nothing."
LINE 78: Unfortunately, owing to a slight miscalculation, the invention proved
LINE 79: to be impracticable; but Albert's intelligence was unrebuffed, and he
LINE 80: passed on, to plunge with all his accustomed ardour into a prolonged
LINE 81: study of the rudiments of lithography.
LINE 82: But naturally it was upon his children that his private interests and
LINE 83: those of Victoria were concentrated most vigorously. The royal nurseries
LINE 84: showed no sign of emptying. The birth of the Prince Arthur in 1850 was
LINE 85: followed, three years later, by that of the Prince Leopold; and in
LINE 86: 1857 the Princess Beatrice was born. A family of nine must be, in any
LINE 87: circumstances, a grave responsibility; and the Prince realised to the
LINE 88: full how much the high destinies of his offspring intensified the need
LINE 89: of parental care. It was inevitable that he should believe profoundly
LINE 90: in the importance of education; he himself had been the product of
LINE 91: education; Stockmar had made him what he was; it was for him, in his
LINE 92: turn, to be a Stockmar--to be even more than a Stockmar--to the young
LINE 93: creatures he had brought into the world. Victoria would assist him; a
LINE 94: Stockmar, no doubt, she could hardly be; but she could be perpetually
LINE 95: vigilant, she could mingle strictness with her affection, and she could
LINE 96: always set a good example. These considerations, of course, applied
LINE 97: pre-eminently to the education of the Prince of Wales. How tremendous
LINE 98: was the significance of every particle of influence which went to the
LINE 99: making of the future King of England! Albert set to work with a will.
LINE 100: But, watching with Victoria the minutest details of the physical,
LINE 101: intellectual, and moral training of his children, he soon perceived, to
LINE 102: his distress, that there was something unsatisfactory in the development
LINE 103: of his eldest son. The Princess Royal was an extremely intelligent
LINE 104: child; but Bertie, though he was good-humoured and gentle, seemed to
LINE 105: display a deep-seated repugnance to every form of mental exertion. This
LINE 106: was most regrettable, but the remedy was obvious: the parental efforts
LINE 107: must be redoubled; instruction must be multiplied; not for a single
LINE 108: instant must the educational pressure be allowed to relax. Accordingly,
LINE 109: more tutors were selected, the curriculum was revised, the time-table of
LINE 110: studies was rearranged, elaborate memoranda dealing with every possible
LINE 111: contingency were drawn up. It was above all essential that there should
LINE 112: be no slackness: "Work," said the Prince, "must be work." And work
LINE 113: indeed it was. The boy grew up amid a ceaseless round of paradigms,
LINE 114: syntactical exercises, dates, genealogical tables, and lists of capes.
LINE 115: Constant notes flew backwards and forwards between the Prince, the
LINE 116: Queen, and the tutors, with inquiries, with reports of progress, with
LINE 117: detailed recommendations; and these notes were all carefully preserved
LINE 118: for future reference. It was, besides, vital that the heir to the throne
LINE 119: should be protected from the slightest possibility of contamination from
LINE 120: the outside world. The Prince of Wales was not as other boys; he might,
LINE 121: occasionally, be allowed to invite some sons of the nobility, boys of
LINE 122: good character, to play with him in the garden of Buckingham Palace;
LINE 123: but his father presided, with alarming precision, over their sports. In
LINE 124: short, every possible precaution was taken, every conceivable effort
LINE 125: was made. Yet, strange to say, the object of all this vigilance and
LINE 126: solicitude continued to be unsatisfactory--appeared, in fact, to be
LINE 127: positively growing worse. It was certainly very odd: the more lessons
LINE 128: that Bertie had to do, the less he did them; and the more carefully he
LINE 129: was guarded against excitements and frivolities, the more desirous
LINE 130: of mere amusement he seemed to become. Albert was deeply grieved and
LINE 131: Victoria was sometimes very angry; but grief and anger produced no more
LINE 132: effect than supervision and time-tables. The Prince of Wales, in
LINE 133: spite of everything, grew up into manhood without the faintest sign of
LINE 134: "adherence to and perseverance in the plan both of studies and life--"
LINE 135: as one of the Royal memoranda put it--which had been laid down with such
LINE 136: extraordinary forethought by his father.
LINE 137: II
LINE 138: Against the insidious worries of politics, the boredom of society
LINE 139: functions, and the pompous publicity of state ceremonies, Osborne had
LINE 140: afforded a welcome refuge; but it soon appeared that even Osborne was
LINE 141: too little removed from the world. After all, the Solent was a feeble
LINE 142: barrier. Oh, for some distant, some almost inaccessible sanctuary,
LINE 143: where, in true domestic privacy, one could make happy holiday, just as
LINE 144: if--or at least very, very, nearly--one were anybody else! Victoria,
LINE 145: ever since, together with Albert, she had visited Scotland in the early
LINE 146: years of her marriage, had felt that her heart was in the Highlands. She
LINE 147: had returned to them a few years later, and her passion had grown. How
LINE 148: romantic they were! And how Albert enjoyed them too! His spirits rose
LINE 149: quite wonderfully as soon as he found himself among the hills and the
LINE 150: conifers. "It is a happiness to see him," she wrote. "Oh! What can equal
LINE 151: the beauties of nature!" she exclaimed in her journal, during one of
LINE 152: these visits. "What enjoyment there is in them! Albert enjoys it so
LINE 153: much; he is in ecstasies here." "Albert said," she noted next day, "that
LINE 154: the chief beauty of mountain scenery consists in its frequent changes.
LINE 155: We came home at six o'clock." Then she went on a longer expedition--up
LINE 156: to the very top of a high hill. "It was quite romantic. Here we were
LINE 157: with only this Highlander behind us holding the ponies (for we got off
LINE 158: twice and walked about). . . . We came home at half-past eleven,--the
LINE 159: most delightful, most romantic ride and walk I ever had. I had never
LINE 160: been up such a mountain, and then the day was so fine." The Highlanders,
LINE 161: too, were such astonishing people. They "never make difficulties," she
LINE 162: noted, "but are cheerful, and happy, and merry, and ready to walk,
LINE 163: and run, and do anything." As for Albert he "highly appreciated the
LINE 164: good-breeding, simplicity, and intelligence, which make it so pleasant
LINE 165: and even instructive to talk to them." "We were always in the habit,"
LINE 166: wrote Her Majesty, "of conversing with the Highlanders--with whom one
LINE 167: comes so much in contact in the Highlands." She loved everything about
LINE 168: them--their customs, their dress, their dances, even their musical
LINE 169: instruments. "There were nine pipers at the castle," she wrote after
LINE 170: staying with Lord Breadalbane; "sometimes one and sometimes three
LINE 171: played. They always played about breakfast-time, again during the
LINE 172: morning, at luncheon, and also whenever we went in and out; again before
LINE 173: dinner, and during most of dinner-time. We both have become quite fond
LINE 174: of the bag-pipes."
LINE 175: It was quite impossible not to wish to return to such pleasures again
LINE 176: and again; and in 1848 the Queen took a lease of Balmoral House, a small
LINE 177: residence near Braemar in the wilds of Aberdeenshire. Four years later
LINE 178: she bought the place outright. Now she could be really happy every
LINE 179: summer; now she could be simple and at her ease; now she could
LINE 180: be romantic every evening, and dote upon Albert, without a single
LINE 181: distraction, all day long. The diminutive scale of the house was in
LINE 182: itself a charm. Nothing was more amusing than to find oneself living
LINE 183: in two or three little sitting--rooms, with the children crammed away
LINE 184: upstairs, and the minister in attendance with only a tiny bedroom to do
LINE 185: all his work in. And then to be able to run in and out of doors as one
LINE 186: liked, and to sketch, and to walk, and to watch the red deer coming so
LINE 187: surprisingly close, and to pay visits to the cottagers! And occasionally
LINE 188: one could be more adventurous still--one could go and stay for a night
LINE 189: or two at the Bothie at Alt-na-giuthasach--a mere couple of huts with "a
LINE 190: wooden addition"--and only eleven people in the whole party! And there
LINE 191: were mountains to be climbed and cairns to be built in solemn pomp. "At
LINE 192: last, when the cairn, which is, I think, seven or eight feet high, was
LINE 193: nearly completed, Albert climbed up to the top of it, and placed the
LINE 194: last stone; after which three cheers were given. It was a gay, pretty,
LINE 195: and touching sight; and I felt almost inclined to cry. The view was
LINE 196: so beautiful over the dear hills; the day so fine; the whole so
LINE 197: gemuthlich." And in the evening there were sword-dances and reels.
LINE 198: But Albert had determined to pull down the little old house, and to
LINE 199: build in its place a castle of his own designing. With great ceremony,
LINE 200: in accordance with a memorandum drawn up by the Prince for the occasion,
LINE 201: the foundation-stone of the new edifice was laid, and by 1855 it was
LINE 202: habitable. Spacious, built of granite in the Scotch baronial style, with
LINE 203: a tower 100 feet high, and minor turrets and castellated gables,
LINE 204: the castle was skilfully arranged to command the finest views of the
LINE 205: surrounding mountains and of the neighbouring river Dee. Upon the
LINE 206: interior decorations Albert and Victoria lavished all their care. The
LINE 207: wall and the floors were of pitch-pine, and covered with specially
LINE 208: manufactured tartars. The Balmoral tartan, in red and grey, designed by
LINE 209: the Prince, and the Victoria tartan, with a white stripe, designed by
LINE 210: the Queen, were to be seen in every room: there were tartan curtains,
LINE 211: and tartan chair-covers, and even tartan linoleums. Occasionally the
LINE 212: Royal Stuart tartan appeared, for Her Majesty always maintained that she
LINE 213: was an ardent Jacobite. Water-colour sketches by Victoria hung upon the
LINE 214: walls, together with innumerable stags' antlers, and the head of a boar,
LINE 215: which had been shot by Albert in Germany. In an alcove in the hall,
LINE 216: stood a life-sized statue of Albert in Highland dress.
LINE 217: Victoria declared that it was perfection. "Every year," she wrote, "my
LINE 218: heart becomes more fixed in this dear paradise, and so much more so
LINE 219: now, that ALL has become my dear Albert's own creation, own work, own
LINE 220: building, own lay-out... and his great taste, and the impress of his
LINE 221: dear hand, have been stamped everywhere."
LINE 222: And here, in very truth, her happiest days were passed. In after years,
LINE 223: when she looked back upon them, a kind of glory, a radiance as of
LINE 224: an unearthly holiness, seemed to glow about these golden hours. Each
LINE 225: hallowed moment stood out clear, beautiful, eternally significant. For,
LINE 226: at the time, every experience there, sentimental, or grave, or trivial,
LINE 227: had come upon her with a peculiar vividness, like a flashing of
LINE 228: marvellous lights. Albert's stalkings--an evening walk when she lost her
LINE 229: way--Vicky sitting down on a wasps' nest--a torchlight dance--with what
LINE 230: intensity such things, and ten thousand like them, impressed themselves
LINE 231: upon her eager consciousness! And how she flew to her journal to note
LINE 232: them down! The news of the Duke's death! What a moment--when, as she
LINE 233: sat sketching after a picnic by a loch in the lonely hills, Lord Derby's
LINE 234: letter had been brought to her, and she had learnt that "ENGLAND'S, or
LINE 235: rather BRITAIN'S pride, her glory, her hero, the greatest man she had
LINE 236: ever produced, was no morel." For such were here reflections upon
LINE 237: the "old rebel" of former days. But that past had been utterly
LINE 238: obliterated--no faintest memory of it remained. For years she had
LINE 239: looked up to the Duke as a figure almost superhuman. Had he not been a
LINE 240: supporter of good Sir Robert? Had he not asked Albert to succeed him as
LINE 241: commander-in-chief? And what a proud moment it had been when he stood as
LINE 242: sponsor to her son Arthur, who was born on his eighty-first birthday! So
LINE 243: now she filled a whole page of her diary with panegyrical regrets. "His
LINE 244: position was the highest a subject ever had--above party--looked up to
LINE 245: by all--revered by the whole nation--the friend of the Sovereign... The
LINE 246: Crown never possessed--and I fear never WILL--so DEVOTED, loyal,
LINE 247: and faithful a subject, so staunch a supporter! To US his loss is
LINE 248: IRREPARABLE... To Albert he showed the greatest kindness and the utmost
LINE 249: confidence... Not an eye will be dry in the whole country." These were
LINE 250: serious thoughts; but they were soon succeeded by others hardly less
LINE 251: moving--by events as impossible to forget--by Mr. MacLeod's sermon
LINE 252: on Nicodemus--by the gift of a red flannel petticoat to Mrs. P.
LINE 253: Farquharson, and another to old Kitty Kear.
LINE 254: But, without doubt, most memorable, most delightful of all were the
LINE 255: expeditions--the rare, exciting expeditions up distant mountains, across
LINE 256: broad rivers, through strange country, and lasting several days. With
LINE 257: only two gillies--Grant and Brown--for servants, and with assumed names.
LINE 258: It was more like something in a story than real life. "We had decided
LINE 259: to call ourselves LORD AND LADY CHURCHILL AND AND PARTY--Lady Churchill
LINE 260: passing as MISS SPENCER and General Grey as DR. GREY! Brown once forgot
LINE 261: this and called me 'Your Majesty' as I was getting into the carriage,
LINE 262: and Grant on the box once called Albert 'Your Royal Highness,' which
LINE 263: set us off laughing, but no one observed it." Strong, vigorous,
LINE 264: enthusiastic, bringing, so it seemed, good fortune with her--the
LINE 265: Highlanders declared she had "a lucky foot"--she relished
LINE 266: everything--the scrambles and the views and the contretemps and the
LINE 267: rough inns with their coarse fare and Brown and Grant waiting at table.
LINE 268: She could have gone on for ever and ever, absolutely happy with Albert
LINE 269: beside her and Brown at her pony's head. But the time came for turning
LINE 270: homewards, alas! the time came for going back to England. She could
LINE 271: hardly bear it; she sat disconsolate in her room and watched the snow
LINE 272: falling. The last day! Oh! If only she could be snowed up!
LINE 273: III
LINE 274: The Crimean War brought new experiences, and most of them were pleasant
LINE 275: ones. It was pleasant to be patriotic and pugnacious, to look out
LINE 276: appropriate prayers to be read in the churches, to have news of
LINE 277: glorious victories, and to know oneself, more proudly than ever, the
LINE 278: representative of England. With that spontaneity of feeling which was so
LINE 279: peculiarly her own, Victoria poured out her emotion, her admiration,
LINE 280: her pity, her love, upon her "dear soldiers." When she gave them their
LINE 281: medals her exultation knew no bounds. "Noble fellows!" she wrote to the
LINE 282: King of the Belgians, "I own I feel as if these were MY OWN CHILDREN;
LINE 283: my heart beats for THEM as for my NEAREST and DEAREST. They were so
LINE 284: touched, so pleased; many, I hear, cried--and they won't hear of giving
LINE 285: up their medals to have their names engraved upon them for fear they
LINE 286: should not receive the IDENTICAL ONE put into THEIR HANDS BY ME, which
LINE 287: is quite touching. Several came by in a sadly mutilated state." She and
LINE 288: they were at one. They felt that she had done them a splendid honour,
LINE 289: and she, with perfect genuineness, shared their feeling. Albert's
LINE 290: attitude towards such things was different; there was an austerity
LINE 291: in him which quite prohibited the expansions of emotion. When General
LINE 292: Williams returned from the heroic defence of Kars and was presented at
LINE 293: Court, the quick, stiff, distant bow with which the Prince received him
LINE 294: struck like ice upon the beholders. He was a stranger still.
LINE 295: But he had other things to occupy him, more important, surely, than the
LINE 296: personal impressions of military officers and people who went to Court.
LINE 297: He was at work--ceaselessly at work--on the tremendous task of carrying
LINE 298: through the war to a successful conclusion. State papers, despatches,
LINE 299: memoranda, poured from him in an overwhelming stream. Between 1853 and
LINE 300: 1857 fifty folio volumes were filled with the comments of his pen upon
LINE 301: the Eastern question. Nothing would induce him to stop. Weary ministers
LINE 302: staggered under the load of his advice; but his advice continued, piling
LINE 303: itself up over their writing-tables, and flowing out upon them from
LINE 304: red box after red box. Nor was it advice to be ignored. The talent for
LINE 305: administration which had reorganised the royal palaces and planned the
LINE 306: Great Exhibition asserted itself no less in the confused complexities of
LINE 307: war. Again and again the Prince's suggestions, rejected or unheeded at
LINE 308: first, were adopted under the stress of circumstances and found to be
LINE 309: full of value. The enrolment of a foreign legion, the establishment of
LINE 310: a depot for troops at Malta, the institution of periodical reports and
LINE 311: tabulated returns as to the condition of the army at Sebastopol--such
LINE 312: were the contrivances and the achievements of his indefatigable brain.
LINE 313: He went further: in a lengthy minute he laid down the lines for a
LINE 314: radical reform in the entire administration of the army. This was
LINE 315: premature, but his proposal that "a camp of evolution" should be
LINE 316: created, in which troops should be concentrated and drilled, proved to
LINE 317: be the germ of Aldershot.
LINE 318: Meanwhile Victoria had made a new friend: she had suddenly been
LINE 319: captivated by Napoleon III. Her dislike of him had been strong at first.
LINE 320: She considered that he was a disreputable adventurer who had usurped the
LINE 321: throne of poor old Louis Philippe; and besides he was hand-in-glove
LINE 322: with Lord Palmerston. For a long time, although he was her ally, she was
LINE 323: unwilling to meet him; but at last a visit of the Emperor and Empress to
LINE 324: England was arranged. Directly he appeared at Windsor her heart began
LINE 325: to soften. She found that she was charmed by his quiet manners, his
LINE 326: low, soft voice, and by the soothing simplicity of his conversation. The
LINE 327: good-will of England was essential to the Emperor's position in Europe,
LINE 328: and he had determined to fascinate the Queen. He succeeded. There was
LINE 329: something deep within her which responded immediately and vehemently to
LINE 330: natures that offered a romantic contrast with her own. Her adoration
LINE 331: of Lord Melbourne was intimately interwoven with her half-unconscious
LINE 332: appreciation of the exciting unlikeness between herself and that
LINE 333: sophisticated, subtle, aristocratical old man. Very different was the
LINE 334: quality of her unlikeness to Napoleon; but its quantity was at least
LINE 335: as great. From behind the vast solidity of her respectability, her
LINE 336: conventionality, her established happiness, she peered out with a
LINE 337: strange delicious pleasure at that unfamiliar, darkly-glittering foreign
LINE 338: object, moving so meteorically before her, an ambiguous creature of
LINE 339: wilfulness and Destiny. And, to her surprise, where she had dreaded
LINE 340: antagonisms, she discovered only sympathies. He was, she said, "so
LINE 341: quiet, so simple, naif even, so pleased to be informed about things he
LINE 342: does not know, so gentle, so full of tact, dignity, and modesty, so full
LINE 343: of kind attention towards us, never saying a word, or doing a thing,
LINE 344: which could put me out... There is something fascinating, melancholy,
LINE 345: and engaging which draws you to him, in spite of any prevention you may
LINE 346: have against him, and certainly without the assistance of any outward
LINE 347: appearance, though I like his face." She observed that he rode
LINE 348: "extremely well, and looks well on horseback, as he sits high." And
LINE 349: he danced "with great dignity and spirit." Above all, he listened to
LINE 350: Albert; listened with the most respectful attention; showed, in fact,
LINE 351: how pleased he was "to be informed about things he did not know;" and
LINE 352: afterwards was heard to declare that he had never met the Prince's
LINE 353: equal. On one occasion, indeed--but only on one--he had seemed to grow
LINE 354: slightly restive. In a diplomatic conversation, "I expatiated a little
LINE 355: on the Holstein question," wrote the Prince in a memorandum, "which
LINE 356: appeared to bore the Emperor as 'tres compliquee.'"
LINE 357: Victoria, too, became much attached to the Empress, whose looks and
LINE 358: graces she admired without a touch of jealousy. Eugenie, indeed, in
LINE 359: the plenitude of her beauty, exquisitely dressed in wonderful Parisian
LINE 360: crinolines which set off to perfection her tall and willowy figure,
LINE 361: might well have caused some heart-burning in the breast of her hostess,
LINE 362: who, very short, rather stout, quite plain, in garish middle-class
LINE 363: garments, could hardly be expected to feel at her best in such company.
LINE 364: But Victoria had no misgivings. To her it mattered nothing that her
LINE 365: face turned red in the heat and that her purple pork-pie hat was of last
LINE 366: year's fashion, while Eugenie, cool and modish, floated in an infinitude
LINE 367: of flounces by her side. She was Queen of England, and was not that
LINE 368: enough? It certainly seemed to be; true majesty was hers, and she knew
LINE 369: it. More than once, when the two were together in public, it was the
LINE 370: woman to whom, as it seemed, nature and art had given so little, who,
LINE 371: by the sheer force of an inherent grandeur, completely threw her adorned
LINE 372: and beautiful companion into the shade.
LINE 373: There were tears when the moment came for parting, and Victoria felt
LINE 374: "quite wehmuthig," as her guests went away from Windsor. But before long
LINE 375: she and Albert paid a return visit to France, where everything was very
LINE 376: delightful, and she drove incognito through the streets of Paris in a
LINE 377: "common bonnet," and saw a play in the theatre at St. Cloud, and, one
LINE 378: evening, at a great party given by the Emperor in her honour at the
LINE 379: Chateau of Versailles, talked a little to a distinguished-looking
LINE 380: Prussian gentleman, whose name was Bismarck. Her rooms were furnished
LINE 381: so much to her taste that she declared they gave her quite a home
LINE 382: feeling--that, if her little dog were there, she should really imagine
LINE 383: herself at home. Nothing was said, but three days later her little
LINE 384: dog barked a welcome to her as she entered the apartments. The Emperor
LINE 385: himself, sparing neither trouble nor expense, had personally arranged
LINE 386: the charming surprise. Such were his attentions. She returned to England
LINE 387: more enchanted than ever. "Strange indeed," she exclaimed, "are the
LINE 388: dispensations and ways of Providence!"
LINE 389: The alliance prospered, and the war drew towards a conclusion. Both the
LINE 390: Queen and the Prince, it is true, were most anxious that there should
LINE 391: not be a premature peace. When Lord Aberdeen wished to open negotiations
LINE 392: Albert attacked him in a "geharnischten" letter, while Victoria rode
LINE 393: about on horseback reviewing the troops. At last, however, Sebastopol
LINE 394: was captured. The news reached Balmoral late at night, and in a few
LINE 395: minutes Albert and all the gentlemen in every species of attire sallied
LINE 396: forth, followed by all the servants, and gradually by all the population
LINE 397: of the village-keepers, gillies, workmen--"up to the top of the cairn."
LINE 398: A bonfire was lighted, the pipes were played, and guns were shot off.
LINE 399: "About three-quarters of an hour after Albert came down and said the
LINE 400: scene had been wild and exciting beyond everything. The people had
LINE 401: been drinking healths in whisky and were in great ecstasy." The "great
LINE 402: ecstasy," perhaps, would be replaced by other feelings next morning;
LINE 403: but at any rate the war was over--though, to be sure, its end seemed as
LINE 404: difficult to account for as its beginning. The dispensations and ways of
LINE 405: Providence continued to be strange.
LINE 406: IV
LINE 407: An unexpected consequence of the war was a complete change in the
LINE 408: relations between the royal pair and Palmerston. The Prince and the
LINE 409: Minister drew together over their hostility to Russia, and thus it came
LINE 410: about that when Victoria found it necessary to summon her old enemy to
LINE 411: form an administration she did so without reluctance. The premiership,
LINE 412: too, had a sobering effect upon Palmerston; he grew less impatient and
LINE 413: dictatorial; considered with attention the suggestions of the Crown, and
LINE 414: was, besides, genuinely impressed by the Prince's ability and knowledge.
LINE 415: Friction, no doubt, there still occasionally was, for, while the Queen
LINE 416: and the Prince devoted themselves to foreign politics as much as ever,
LINE 417: their views, when the war was over, became once more antagonistic to
LINE 418: those of the Prime Minister. This was especially the case with regard
LINE 419: to Italy. Albert, theoretically the friend of constitutional government,
LINE 420: distrusted Cavour, was horrified by Garibaldi, and dreaded the danger
LINE 421: of England being drawn into war with Austria. Palmerston, on the other
LINE 422: hand, was eager for Italian independence; but he was no longer at the
LINE 423: Foreign Office, and the brunt of the royal displeasure had now to be
LINE 424: borne by Lord John Russell. In a few years the situation had curiously
LINE 425: altered. It was Lord John who now filled the subordinate and the
LINE 426: ungrateful role; but the Foreign Secretary, in his struggle with
LINE 427: the Crown, was supported, instead of opposed, by the Prime Minister.
LINE 428: Nevertheless the struggle was fierce, and the policy, by which the
LINE 429: vigorous sympathy of England became one of the decisive factors in the
LINE 430: final achievement of Italian unity, was only carried through in face of
LINE 431: the violent opposition of the Court.
LINE 432: Towards the other European storm-centre, also, the Prince's attitude
LINE 433: continued to be very different to that of Palmerston. Albert's great
LINE 434: wish was for a united Germany under the leadership of a constitutional
LINE 435: and virtuous Prussia; Palmerston did not think that there was much to
LINE 436: be said for the scheme, but he took no particular interest in German
LINE 437: politics, and was ready enough to agree to a proposal which was warmly
LINE 438: supported by both the Prince and the Queen--that the royal Houses of
LINE 439: England and Prussia should be united by the marriage of the Princess
LINE 440: Royal with the Prussian Crown Prince. Accordingly, when the Princess was
LINE 441: not yet fifteen, the Prince, a young man of twenty-four, came over on
LINE 442: a visit to Balmoral, and the betrothal took place. Two years later,
LINE 443: in 1857, the marriage was celebrated. At the last moment, however, it
LINE 444: seemed that there might be a hitch. It was pointed out in Prussia that
LINE 445: it was customary for Princes of the blood royal to be married in Berlin,
LINE 446: and it was suggested that there was no reason why the present case
LINE 447: should be treated as an exception. When this reached the ears of
LINE 448: Victoria, she was speechless with indignation. In a note, emphatic
LINE 449: even for Her Majesty, she instructed the Foreign Secretary to tell
LINE 450: the Prussian Ambassador "not to ENTERTAIN the POSSIBILITY of such a
LINE 451: question... The Queen NEVER could consent to it, both for public and for
LINE 452: private reasons, and the assumption of its being TOO MUCH for a Prince
LINE 453: Royal of Prussia to come over to marry the Princess Royal of Great
LINE 454: Britain in England is too ABSURD to say the least. . . Whatever may be
LINE 455: the usual practice of Prussian princes, it is not EVERY day that one
LINE 456: marries the eldest daughter of the Queen of England. The question must
LINE 457: therefore be considered as settled and closed." It was, and the
LINE 458: wedding took place in St. James's Chapel. There were great
LINE 459: festivities--illuminations, state concerts, immense crowds, and general
LINE 460: rejoicings. At Windsor a magnificent banquet was given to the bride and
LINE 461: bridegroom in the Waterloo room, at which, Victoria noted in her diary,
LINE 462: "everybody was most friendly and kind about Vicky and full of the
LINE 463: universal enthusiasm, of which the Duke of Buccleuch gave us most
LINE 464: pleasing instances, he having been in the very thick of the crowd and
LINE 465: among the lowest of the low." Her feelings during several days had been
LINE 466: growing more and more emotional, and when the time came for the young
LINE 467: couple to depart she very nearly broke down--but not quite. "Poor dear
LINE 468: child!" she wrote afterwards. "I clasped her in my arms and blessed her,
LINE 469: and knew not what to say. I kissed good Fritz and pressed his hand again
LINE 470: and again. He was unable to speak and the tears were in his eyes. I
LINE 471: embraced them both again at the carriage door, and Albert got into the
LINE 472: carriage, an open one, with them and Bertie... The band struck up. I
LINE 473: wished good-bye to the good Perponchers. General Schreckenstein was much
LINE 474: affected. I pressed his hand, and the good Dean's, and then went quickly
LINE 475: upstairs."
LINE 476: Albert, as well as General Schreckenstein, was much affected. He was
LINE 477: losing his favourite child, whose opening intelligence had already begun
LINE 478: to display a marked resemblance to his own--an adoring pupil, who, in
LINE 479: a few years, might have become an almost adequate companion. An ironic
LINE 480: fate had determined that the daughter who was taken from him should be
LINE 481: sympathetic, clever, interested in the arts and sciences, and endowed
LINE 482: with a strong taste for memoranda, while not a single one of these
LINE 483: qualities could be discovered in the son who remained. For certainly
LINE 484: the Prince of Wales did not take after his father. Victoria's prayer had
LINE 485: been unanswered, and with each succeeding year it became more obvious
LINE 486: that Bertie was a true scion of the House of Brunswick. But these
LINE 487: evidences of innate characteristics only served to redouble the efforts
LINE 488: of his parents; it still might not be too late to incline the young
LINE 489: branch, by ceaseless pressure and careful fastenings, to grow in
LINE 490: the proper direction. Everything was tried. The boy was sent on a
LINE 491: continental tour with a picked body of tutors, but the results were
LINE 492: unsatisfactory. At his father's request he kept a diary which, on his
LINE 493: return, was inspected by the Prince. It was found to be distressingly
LINE 494: meagre: what a multitude of highly interesting reflections might have
LINE 495: been arranged under the heading: "The First Prince of Wales visiting the
LINE 496: Pope!" But there was not a single one. "Le jeune prince plaisit a
LINE 497: tout le monde," old Metternich reported to Guizot, "mais avait l'air
LINE 498: embarrasse et tres triste." On his seventeenth birthday a memorandum
LINE 499: was drawn up over the names of the Queen and the Prince informing their
LINE 500: eldest son that he was now entering upon the period of manhood,
LINE 501: and directing him henceforward to perform the duties of a Christian
LINE 502: gentleman. "Life is composed of duties," said the memorandum, "and in
LINE 503: the due, punctual and cheerful performance of them the true Christian,
LINE 504: true soldier, and true gentleman is recognised... A new sphere of life
LINE 505: will open for you in which you will have to be taught what to do and
LINE 506: what not to do, a subject requiring study more important than any in
LINE 507: which you have hitherto been engaged." On receipt of the memorandum
LINE 508: Bertie burst into tears. At the same time another memorandum was drawn
LINE 509: up, headed "confidential: for the guidance of the gentlemen appointed
LINE 510: to attend on the Prince of Wales." This long and elaborate document laid
LINE 511: down "certain principles" by which the "conduct and demeanour" of the
LINE 512: gentlemen were to be regulated "and which it is thought may conduce to
LINE 513: the benefit of the Prince of Wales." "The qualities which distinguish a
LINE 514: gentleman in society," continued this remarkable paper, "are:--
LINE 515: (1) His appearance, his deportment and dress.
LINE 516: (2) The character of his relations with, and treatment of, others.
LINE 517: (3) His desire and power to acquit himself creditably in conversation or
LINE 518: whatever is the occupation of the society with which he mixes."
LINE 519: A minute and detailed analysis of these subheadings followed, filling
LINE 520: several pages, and the memorandum ended with a final exhortation to the
LINE 521: gentlemen: "If they will duly appreciate the responsibility of their
LINE 522: position, and taking the points above laid down as the outline, will
LINE 523: exercise their own good sense in acting UPON ALL OCCASIONS all
LINE 524: upon these principles, thinking no point of detail too minute to be
LINE 525: important, but maintaining one steady consistent line of conduct
LINE 526: they may render essential service to the young Prince and justify the
LINE 527: flattering selection made by the royal parents." A year later the young
LINE 528: Prince was sent to Oxford, where the greatest care was taken that
LINE 529: he should not mix with the undergraduates. Yes, everything had been
LINE 530: tried--everything... with one single exception. The experiment had never
LINE 531: been made of letting Bertie enjoy himself. But why should it have been?
LINE 532: "Life is composed of duties." What possible place could there be for
LINE 533: enjoyment in the existence of a Prince of Wales?
LINE 534: The same year which deprived Albert of the Princess Royal brought him
LINE 535: another and a still more serious loss. The Baron had paid his last visit
LINE 536: to England. For twenty years, as he himself said in a letter to the King
LINE 537: of the Belgians, he had performed "the laborious and exhausting office
LINE 538: of a paternal friend and trusted adviser" to the Prince and the Queen.
LINE 539: He was seventy; he was tired, physically and mentally; it was time to
LINE 540: go. He returned to his home in Coburg, exchanging, once for all, the
LINE 541: momentous secrecies of European statecraft for the little-tattle of a
LINE 542: provincial capital and the gossip of family life. In his stiff chair
LINE 543: by the fire he nodded now over old stories--not of emperors and
LINE 544: generals--but of neighbours and relatives and the domestic adventures
LINE 545: of long ago--the burning of his father's library--and the goat that ran
LINE 546: upstairs to his sister's room and ran twice round the table and then ran
LINE 547: down again. Dyspepsia and depression still attacked him; but, looking
LINE 548: back over his life, he was not dissatisfied. His conscience was clear.
LINE 549: "I have worked as long as I had strength to work," he said, "and for a
LINE 550: purpose no one can impugn. The consciousness of this is my reward--the
LINE 551: only one which I desired to earn."
LINE 552: Apparently, indeed, his "purpose" had been accomplished. By his wisdom,
LINE 553: his patience, and his example he had brought about, in the fullness of
LINE 554: time, the miraculous metamorphosis of which he had dreamed. The Prince
LINE 555: was his creation. An indefatigable toiler, presiding, for the highest
LINE 556: ends, over a great nation--that was his achievement; and he looked upon
LINE 557: his work and it was good. But had the Baron no misgivings? Did he never
LINE 558: wonder whether, perhaps, he might have accomplished not too little but
LINE 559: too much? How subtle and how dangerous are the snares which fate lays
LINE 560: for the wariest of men! Albert, certainly, seemed to be everything
LINE 561: that Stockmar could have wished--virtuous, industrious, persevering,
LINE 562: intelligent. And yet--why was it--all was not well with him? He was sick
LINE 563: at heart.
LINE 564: For in spite of everything he had never reached to happiness. His work,
LINE 565: for which at last he came to crave with an almost morbid appetite, was
LINE 566: a solace and not a cure; the dragon of his dissatisfaction devoured with
LINE 567: dark relish that ever-growing tribute of laborious days and nights;
LINE 568: but it was hungry still. The causes of his melancholy were hidden,
LINE 569: mysterious, unanalysable perhaps--too deeply rooted in the innermost
LINE 570: recesses of his temperament for the eye of reason to apprehend. There
LINE 571: were contradictions in his nature, which, to some of those who knew him
LINE 572: best, made him seem an inexplicable enigma: he was severe and gentle; he
LINE 573: was modest and scornful; he longed for affection and he was cold. He was
LINE 574: lonely, not merely with the loneliness of exile but with the loneliness
LINE 575: of conscious and unrecognised superiority. He had the pride, at once
LINE 576: resigned and overweening, of a doctrinaire. And yet to say that he
LINE 577: was simply a doctrinaire would be a false description; for the pure
LINE 578: doctrinaire rejoices always in an internal contentment, and Albert was
LINE 579: very far from doing that. There was something that he wanted and that
LINE 580: he could never get. What was it? Some absolute, some ineffable sympathy?
LINE 581: Some extraordinary, some sublime success? Possibly, it was a mixture
LINE 582: of both. To dominate and to be understood! To conquer, by the same
LINE 583: triumphant influence, the submission and the appreciation of men--that
LINE 584: would be worth while indeed! But, to such imaginations, he saw too
LINE 585: clearly how faint were the responses of his actual environment. Who was
LINE 586: there who appreciated him, really and truly? Who COULD appreciate him
LINE 587: in England? And, if the gentle virtue of an inward excellence availed so
LINE 588: little, could he expect more from the hard ways of skill and force? The
LINE 589: terrible land of his exile loomed before him a frigid, an impregnable
LINE 590: mass. Doubtless he had made some slight impression: it was true that
LINE 591: he had gained the respect of his fellow workers, that his probity, his
LINE 592: industry, his exactitude, had been recognised, that he was a highly
LINE 593: influential, an extremely important man. But how far, how very far,
LINE 594: was all this from the goal of his ambitions! How feeble and futile his
LINE 595: efforts seemed against the enormous coagulation of dullness, of folly,
LINE 596: of slackness, of ignorance, of confusion that confronted him! He might
LINE 597: have the strength or the ingenuity to make some small change for the
LINE 598: better here or there--to rearrange some detail, to abolish some anomaly,
LINE 599: to insist upon some obvious reform; but the heart of the appalling
LINE 600: organism remained untouched. England lumbered on, impervious and
LINE 601: self-satisfied, in her old intolerable course. He threw himself across
LINE 602: the path of the monster with rigid purpose and set teeth, but he was
LINE 603: brushed aside. Yes! even Palmerston was still unconquered--was still
LINE 604: there to afflict him with his jauntiness, his muddle-headedness, his
LINE 605: utter lack of principle. It was too much. Neither nature nor the Baron
LINE 606: had given him a sanguine spirit; the seeds of pessimism, once lodged
LINE 607: within him, flourished in a propitious soil. He
LINE 608: "questioned things, and did not find
LINE 609: One that would answer to his mind;
LINE 610: And all the world appeared unkind."
LINE 611: He believed that he was a failure and he began to despair.
LINE 612: Yet Stockmar had told him that he must "never relax," and he never
LINE 613: would. He would go on, working to the utmost and striving for the
LINE 614: highest, to the bitter end. His industry grew almost maniacal.
LINE 615: Earlier and earlier was the green lamp lighted; more vast grew the
LINE 616: correspondence; more searching the examination of the newspapers; the
LINE 617: interminable memoranda more punctilious, analytical, and precise. His
LINE 618: very recreations became duties. He enjoyed himself by time-table, went
LINE 619: deer-stalking with meticulous gusto, and made puns at lunch--it was the
LINE 620: right thing to do. The mechanism worked with astonishing efficiency,
LINE 621: but it never rested and it was never oiled. In dry exactitude the
LINE 622: innumerable cog-wheels perpetually revolved. No, whatever happened, the
LINE 623: Prince would not relax; he had absorbed the doctrines of Stockmar too
LINE 624: thoroughly. He knew what was right, and, at all costs, he would
LINE 625: pursue it. That was certain. But alas! in this our life what are the
LINE 626: certainties? "In nothing be over-zealous!" says an old Greek. "The due
LINE 627: measure in all the works of man is best. For often one who zealously
LINE 628: pushes towards some excellence, though he be pursuing a gain, is really
LINE 629: being led utterly astray by the will of some Power, which makes those
LINE 630: things that are evil seem to him good, and those things seem to him evil
LINE 631: that are for his advantage." Surely, both the Prince and the Baron might
LINE 632: have learnt something from the frigid wisdom of Theognis.
LINE 633: Victoria noticed that her husband sometimes seemed to be depressed and
LINE 634: overworked. She tried to cheer him up. Realising uneasily that he was
LINE 635: still regarded as a foreigner, she hoped that by conferring upon him
LINE 636: the title of Prince Consort (1857) she would improve his position in the
LINE 637: country. "The Queen has a right to claim that her husband should be an
LINE 638: Englishman," she wrote. But unfortunately, in spite of the Royal Letters
LINE 639: Patent, Albert remained as foreign as before; and as the years passed
LINE 640: his dejection deepened. She worked with him, she watched over him, she
LINE 641: walked with him through the woods at Osborne, while he whistled to the
LINE 642: nightingales, as he had whistled once at Rosenau so long ago. When his
LINE 643: birthday came round, she took the greatest pains to choose him presents
LINE 644: that he would really like. In 1858, when he was thirty-nine, she gave
LINE 645: him "a picture of Beatrice, life-size, in oil, by Horsley, a complete
LINE 646: collection of photographic views of Gotha and the country round, which I
LINE 647: had taken by Bedford, and a paper-weight of Balmoral granite and deers'
LINE 648: teeth, designed by Vicky." Albert was of course delighted, and his
LINE 649: merriment at the family gathering was more pronounced than ever: and
LINE 650: yet... what was there that was wrong?
LINE 651: No doubt it was his health. He was wearing himself out in the service of
LINE 652: the country; and certainly his constitution, as Stockmar had perceived
LINE 653: from the first, was ill-adapted to meet a serious strain. He was easily
LINE 654: upset; he constantly suffered from minor ailments. His appearance in
LINE 655: itself was enough to indicate the infirmity of his physical powers. The
LINE 656: handsome youth of twenty years since with the flashing eyes and the soft
LINE 657: complexion had grown into a sallow, tired-looking man, whose body, in
LINE 658: its stoop and its loose fleshiness, betrayed the sedentary labourer,
LINE 659: and whose head was quite bald on the top. Unkind critics, who had once
LINE 660: compared Albert to an operatic tenor, might have remarked that there was
LINE 661: something of the butler about him now. Beside Victoria, he presented a
LINE 662: painful contrast. She, too, was stout, but it was with the plumpness of
LINE 663: a vigorous matron; and an eager vitality was everywhere visible--in her
LINE 664: energetic bearing, her protruding, enquiring glances, her small, fat,
LINE 665: capable, and commanding hands. If only, by some sympathetic magic, she
LINE 666: could have conveyed into that portly, flabby figure, that desiccated and
LINE 667: discouraged brain, a measure of the stamina and the self-assurance which
LINE 668: were so pre-eminently hers!
LINE 669: But suddenly she was reminded that there were other perils besides those
LINE 670: of ill-health. During a visit to Coburg in 1860, the Prince was very
LINE 671: nearly killed in a carriage accident. He escaped with a few cuts and
LINE 672: bruises; but Victoria's alarm was extreme, though she concealed it. "It
LINE 673: is when the Queen feels most deeply," she wrote afterwards, "that she
LINE 674: always appears calmest, and she could not and dared not allow herself
LINE 675: to speak of what might have been, or even to admit to herself (and she
LINE 676: cannot and dare not now) the entire danger, for her head would turn!"
LINE 677: Her agitation, in fact, was only surpassed by her thankfulness to God.
LINE 678: She felt, she said, that she could not rest "without doing something to
LINE 679: mark permanently her feelings," and she decided that she would endow a
LINE 680: charity in Coburg. "L1,000, or even L2,000, given either at once, or
LINE 681: in instalments yearly, would not, in the Queen's opinion, be too much."
LINE 682: Eventually, the smaller sum having been fixed upon, it was invested in
LINE 683: a trust, called the "Victoria-Stift," in the name of the Burgomaster and
LINE 684: chief clergyman of Coburg, who were directed to distribute the interest
LINE 685: yearly among a certain number of young men and women of exemplary
LINE 686: character belonging to the humbler ranks of life.
LINE 687: Shortly afterwards the Queen underwent, for the first time in her life,
LINE 688: the actual experience of close personal loss. Early in 1861 the Duchess
LINE 689: of Kent was taken seriously ill, and in March she died. The event
LINE 690: overwhelmed Victoria. With a morbid intensity, she filled her diary
LINE 691: for pages with minute descriptions of her mother's last hours, her
LINE 692: dissolution, and her corpse, interspersed with vehement apostrophes, and
LINE 693: the agitated outpourings of emotional reflection. In the grief of the
LINE 694: present the disagreements of the past were totally forgotten. It was the
LINE 695: horror and the mystery of Death--Death, present and actual--that seized
LINE 696: upon the imagination of the Queen. Her whole being, so instinct with
LINE 697: vitality, recoiled in agony from the grim spectacle of the triumph of
LINE 698: that awful power. Her own mother, with whom she had lived so closely and
LINE 699: so long that she had become a part almost of her existence, had fallen
LINE 700: into nothingness before her very eyes! She tried to forget, but she
LINE 701: could not. Her lamentations continued with a strange abundance, a
LINE 702: strange persistency. It was almost as if, by some mysterious and
LINE 703: unconscious precognition, she realised that for her, in an especial
LINE 704: manner, that grisly Majesty had a dreadful dart in store.
LINE 705: For indeed, before the year was out, a far more terrible blow was
LINE 706: to fall upon her. Albert, who had for long been suffering from
LINE 707: sleeplessness, went, on a cold and drenching day towards the end of
LINE 708: November, to inspect the buildings for the new Military Academy at
LINE 709: Sandhurst. On his return, it was clear that the fatigue and exposure to
LINE 710: which he had been subjected had seriously affected his health. He was
LINE 711: attacked by rheumatism, his sleeplessness continued, and he complained
LINE 712: that he felt thoroughly unwell. Three days later a painful duty obliged
LINE 713: him to visit Cambridge. The Prince of Wales, who had been placed at that
LINE 714: University in the previous year, was behaving in such a manner that
LINE 715: a parental visit and a parental admonition had become necessary. The
LINE 716: disappointed father, suffering in mind and body, carried through his
LINE 717: task; but, on his return journey to Windsor, he caught a fatal chill.
LINE 718: During the next week he gradually grew weaker and more miserable. Yet,
LINE 719: depressed and enfeebled as he was, he continued to work. It so happened
LINE 720: that at that very moment a grave diplomatic crisis had arisen. Civil
LINE 721: war had broken out in America, and it seemed as if England, owing to a
LINE 722: violent quarrel with the Northern States, was upon the point of being
LINE 723: drawn into the conflict. A severe despatch by Lord John Russell was
LINE 724: submitted to the Queen; and the Prince perceived that, if it was sent
LINE 725: off unaltered, war would be the almost inevitable consequence. At seven
LINE 726: o'clock on the morning of December 1, he rose from his bed, and with a
LINE 727: quavering hand wrote a series of suggestions for the alteration of the
LINE 728: draft, by which its language might be softened, and a way left open for
LINE 729: a peaceful solution of the question. These changes were accepted by the
LINE 730: Government, and war was averted. It was the Prince's last memorandum.
LINE 731: He had always declared that he viewed the prospect of death with
LINE 732: equanimity. "I do not cling to life," he had once said to Victoria. "You
LINE 733: do; but I set no store by it." And then he had added: "I am sure, if I
LINE 734: had a severe illness, I should give up at once, I should not struggle
LINE 735: for life. I have no tenacity of life." He had judged correctly. Before
LINE 736: he had been ill many days, he told a friend that he was convinced he
LINE 737: would not recover. He sank and sank. Nevertheless, if his case had
LINE 738: been properly understood and skilfully treated from the first, he might
LINE 739: conceivably have been saved; but the doctors failed to diagnose his
LINE 740: symptoms; and it is noteworthy that his principal physician was Sir
LINE 741: James Clark. When it was suggested that other advice should be taken,
LINE 742: Sir James pooh-poohed the idea: "there was no cause for alarm," he said.
LINE 743: But the strange illness grew worse. At last, after a letter of fierce
LINE 744: remonstrance from Palmerston, Dr. Watson was sent for; and Dr. Watson
LINE 745: saw at once that he had come too late The Prince was in the grip of
LINE 746: typhoid fever. "I think that everything so far is satisfactory," said
LINE 747: Sir James Clark.(*)
LINE 748: (*) Clarendon, II, 253-4: "One cannot speak with certainty;
LINE 749: but it is horrible to think that such a life MAY have been
LINE 750: sacrificed to Sir J. Clark's selfish jealousy of every
LINE 751: member of his profession." The Earl of Clarendon to the
LINE 752: Duchess of Manchester, December 17, 1861.
LINE 753: The restlessness and the acute suffering of the earlier days gave place
LINE 754: to a settled torpor and an ever--deepening gloom. Once the failing
LINE 755: patient asked for music--"a fine chorale at a distance;" and a piano
LINE 756: having been placed in the adjoining room, Princess Alice played on it
LINE 757: some of Luther's hymns, after which the Prince repeated "The Rock of
LINE 758: Ages." Sometimes his mind wandered; sometimes the distant past came
LINE 759: rushing upon him; he heard the birds in the early morning, and was at
LINE 760: Rosenau again, a boy. Or Victoria would come and read to him "Peveril
LINE 761: of the Peak," and he showed that he could follow the story, and then she
LINE 762: would bend over him, and he would murmur "liebes Frauchen" and "gutes
LINE 763: Weibchen," stroking her cheek. Her distress and her agitation were
LINE 764: great, but she was not seriously frightened. Buoyed up by her own
LINE 765: abundant energies, she would not believe that Albert's might prove
LINE 766: unequal to the strain. She refused to face such a hideous possibility.
LINE 767: She declined to see Dr. Watson. Why should she? Had not Sir James Clark
LINE 768: assured her that all would be well? Only two days before the end, which
LINE 769: was seen now to be almost inevitable by everyone about her, she wrote,
LINE 770: full of apparent confidence, to the King of the Belgians: "I do not sit
LINE 771: up with him at night," she said, "as I could be of no use; and there is
LINE 772: nothing to cause alarm." The Princess Alice tried to tell her the truth,
LINE 773: but her hopefulness would not be daunted. On the morning of December
LINE 774: 14, Albert, just as she had expected, seemed to be better; perhaps
LINE 775: the crisis was over. But in the course of the day there was a serious
LINE 776: relapse. Then at last she allowed herself to see that she was standing
LINE 777: on the edge of an appalling gulf. The whole family was summoned, and,
LINE 778: one after another, the children took a silent farewell of their father.
LINE 779: "It was a terrible moment," Victoria wrote in her diary, "but, thank
LINE 780: God! I was able to command myself, and to be perfectly calm, and
LINE 781: remained sitting by his side." He murmured something, but she could not
LINE 782: hear what it was; she thought he was speaking in French. Then all at
LINE 783: once he began to arrange his hair, "just as he used to do when well and
LINE 784: he was dressing." "Es kleines Frauchen," she whispered to him; and he
LINE 785: seemed to understand. For a moment, towards the evening, she went into
LINE 786: another room, but was immediately called back; she saw at a glance that
LINE 787: a ghastly change had taken place. As she knelt by the bed, he breathed
LINE 788: deeply, breathed gently, breathed at last no more. His features became
LINE 789: perfectly rigid; she shrieked one long wild shriek that rang through the
LINE 790: terror-stricken castle and understood that she had lost him for ever.
