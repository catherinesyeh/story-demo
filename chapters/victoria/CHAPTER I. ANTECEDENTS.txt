LINE 1: On November 6, 1817, died the Princess Charlotte, only child of the
LINE 2: Prince Regent, and heir to the crown of England. Her short life had
LINE 3: hardly been a happy one. By nature impulsive, capricious, and vehement,
LINE 4: she had always longed for liberty; and she had never possessed it.
LINE 5: She had been brought up among violent family quarrels, had been early
LINE 6: separated from her disreputable and eccentric mother, and handed over to
LINE 7: the care of her disreputable and selfish father. When she was seventeen,
LINE 8: he decided to marry her off to the Prince of Orange; she, at first,
LINE 9: acquiesced; but, suddenly falling in love with Prince Augustus of
LINE 10: Prussia, she determined to break off the engagement. This was not her
LINE 11: first love affair, for she had previously carried on a clandestine
LINE 12: correspondence with a Captain Hess. Prince Augustus was already married,
LINE 13: morganatically, but she did not know it, and he did not tell her. While
LINE 14: she was spinning out the negotiations with the Prince of Orange, the
LINE 15: allied sovereign--it was June, 1814--arrived in London to celebrate
LINE 16: their victory. Among them, in the suite of the Emperor of Russia, was
LINE 17: the young and handsome Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg. He made several
LINE 18: attempts to attract the notice of the Princess, but she, with her heart
LINE 19: elsewhere, paid very little attention. Next month the Prince Regent,
LINE 20: discovering that his daughter was having secret meetings with Prince
LINE 21: Augustus, suddenly appeared upon the scene and, after dismissing her
LINE 22: household, sentenced her to a strict seclusion in Windsor Park. "God
LINE 23: Almighty grant me patience!" she exclaimed, falling on her knees in an
LINE 24: agony of agitation: then she jumped up, ran down the backstairs and out
LINE 25: into the street, hailed a passing cab, and drove to her mother's house
LINE 26: in Bayswater. She was discovered, pursued, and at length, yielding
LINE 27: to the persuasions of her uncles, the Dukes of York and Sussex, of
LINE 28: Brougham, and of the Bishop of Salisbury, she returned to Carlton House
LINE 29: at two o'clock in the morning. She was immured at Windsor, but no more
LINE 30: was heard of the Prince of Orange. Prince Augustus, too, disappeared.
LINE 31: The way was at last open to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg.
LINE 32: This Prince was clever enough to get round the Regent, to impress the
LINE 33: Ministers, and to make friends with another of the Princess's uncles,
LINE 34: the Duke of Kent. Through the Duke he was able to communicate privately
LINE 35: with the Princess, who now declared that he was necessary to
LINE 36: her happiness. When, after Waterloo, he was in Paris, the Duke's
LINE 37: aide-de-camp carried letters backwards and forwards across the Channel.
LINE 38: In January 1816 he was invited to England, and in May the marriage took
LINE 39: place.
LINE 40: The character of Prince Leopold contrasted strangely with that of
LINE 41: his wife. The younger son of a German princeling, he was at this time
LINE 42: twenty-six years of age; he had served with distinction in the war
LINE 43: against Napoleon; he had shown considerable diplomatic skill at the
LINE 44: Congress of Vienna; and he was now to try his hand at the task of taming
LINE 45: a tumultuous Princess. Cold and formal in manner, collected in speech,
LINE 46: careful in action, he soon dominated the wild, impetuous, generous
LINE 47: creature by his side. There was much in her, he found, of which he could
LINE 48: not approve. She quizzed, she stamped, she roared with laughter; she
LINE 49: had very little of that self-command which is especially required of
LINE 50: princes; her manners were abominable. Of the latter he was a good judge,
LINE 51: having moved, as he himself explained to his niece many years later, in
LINE 52: the best society of Europe, being in fact "what is called in French de
LINE 53: la fleur des pois." There was continual friction, but every scene
LINE 54: ended in the same way. Standing before him like a rebellious boy in
LINE 55: petticoats, her body pushed forward, her hands behind her back, with
LINE 56: flaming cheeks and sparkling eyes, she would declare at last that she
LINE 57: was ready to do whatever he wanted. "If you wish it, I will do it," she
LINE 58: would say. "I want nothing for myself," he invariably answered; "When
LINE 59: I press something on you, it is from a conviction that it is for your
LINE 60: interest and for your good."
LINE 61: Among the members of the household at Claremont, near Esher, where the
LINE 62: royal pair were established, was a young German physician, Christian
LINE 63: Friedrich Stockmar. He was the son of a minor magistrate in Coburg, and,
LINE 64: after taking part as a medical officer in the war, he had settled down
LINE 65: as a doctor in his native town. Here he had met Prince Leopold, who had
LINE 66: been struck by his ability, and, on his marriage, brought him to England
LINE 67: as his personal physician. A curious fate awaited this young man;
LINE 68: many were the gifts which the future held in store for him--many and
LINE 69: various--influence, power, mystery, unhappiness, a broken heart. At
LINE 70: Claremont his position was a very humble one; but the Princess took
LINE 71: a fancy to him, called him "Stocky," and romped with him along the
LINE 72: corridors. Dyspeptic by constitution, melancholic by temperament, he
LINE 73: could yet be lively on occasion, and was known as a wit in Coburg. He
LINE 74: was virtuous, too, and served the royal menage with approbation. "My
LINE 75: master," he wrote in his diary, "is the best of all husbands in all the
LINE 76: five quarters of the globe; and his wife bears him an amount of love,
LINE 77: the greatness of which can only be compared with the English national
LINE 78: debt." Before long he gave proof of another quality--a quality which was
LINE 79: to colour the whole of his life-cautious sagacity. When, in the spring
LINE 80: of 1817, it was known that the Princess was expecting a child, the post
LINE 81: of one of her physicians-in-ordinary was offered to him, and he had
LINE 82: the good sense to refuse it. He perceived that his colleagues would be
LINE 83: jealous of him, that his advice would probably not be taken, but that,
LINE 84: if anything were to go wrong, it would be certainly the foreign doctor
LINE 85: who would be blamed. Very soon, indeed, he came to the opinion that the
LINE 86: low diet and constant bleedings, to which the unfortunate Princess was
LINE 87: subjected, were an error; he drew the Prince aside, and begged him to
LINE 88: communicate this opinion to the English doctors; but it was useless. The
LINE 89: fashionable lowering treatment was continued for months. On November 5,
LINE 90: at nine o'clock in the evening, after a labour of over fifty hours, the
LINE 91: Princess was delivered of a dead boy. At midnight her exhausted strength
LINE 92: gave way. When, at last, Stockmar consented to see her; he went in, and
LINE 93: found her obviously dying, while the doctors were plying her with wine.
LINE 94: She seized his hand and pressed it. "They have made me tipsy," she said.
LINE 95: After a little he left her, and was already in the next room when he
LINE 96: heard her call out in her loud voice: "Stocky! Stocky!" As he ran back
LINE 97: the death-rattle was in her throat. She tossed herself violently from
LINE 98: side to side; then suddenly drew up her legs, and it was over.
LINE 99: The Prince, after hours of watching, had left the room for a few
LINE 100: moments' rest; and Stockmar had now to tell him that his wife was dead.
LINE 101: At first he could not be made to realise what had happened. On their way
LINE 102: to her room he sank down on a chair while Stockmar knelt beside him: it
LINE 103: was all a dream; it was impossible. At last, by the bed, he, too, knelt
LINE 104: down and kissed the cold hands. Then rising and exclaiming, "Now I am
LINE 105: quite desolate. Promise me never to leave me," he threw himself into
LINE 106: Stockmar's arms.
LINE 107: II
LINE 108: The tragedy at Claremont was of a most upsetting kind. The royal
LINE 109: kaleidoscope had suddenly shifted, and nobody could tell how the new
LINE 110: pattern would arrange itself. The succession to the throne, which had
LINE 111: seemed so satisfactorily settled, now became a matter of urgent doubt.
LINE 112: George III was still living, an aged lunatic, at Windsor, completely
LINE 113: impervious to the impressions of the outer world. Of his seven sons, the
LINE 114: youngest was of more than middle age, and none had legitimate offspring.
LINE 115: The outlook, therefore, was ambiguous. It seemed highly improbable that
LINE 116: the Prince Regent, who had lately been obliged to abandon his stays, and
LINE 117: presented a preposterous figure of debauched obesity, could ever again,
LINE 118: even on the supposition that he divorced his wife and re-married, become
LINE 119: the father of a family. Besides the Duke of Kent, who must be noticed
LINE 120: separately, the other brothers, in order of seniority, were the Dukes of
LINE 121: York, Clarence, Cumberland, Sussex, and Cambridge; their situations and
LINE 122: prospects require a brief description. The Duke of York, whose escapades
LINE 123: in times past with Mrs. Clarke and the army had brought him into
LINE 124: trouble, now divided his life between London and a large, extravagantly
LINE 125: ordered and extremely uncomfortable country house where he occupied
LINE 126: himself with racing, whist, and improper stories. He was remarkable
LINE 127: among the princes for one reason: he was the only one of them--so we
LINE 128: are informed by a highly competent observer--who had the feelings of a
LINE 129: gentleman. He had been long married to the Princess Royal of Prussia,
LINE 130: a lady who rarely went to bed and was perpetually surrounded by vast
LINE 131: numbers of dogs, parrots, and monkeys. They had no children. The Duke
LINE 132: of Clarence had lived for many years in complete obscurity with Mrs.
LINE 133: Jordan, the actress, in Bushey Park. By her he had had a large family
LINE 134: of sons and daughters, and had appeared, in effect to be married to her,
LINE 135: when he suddenly separated from her and offered to marry Miss Wykeham, a
LINE 136: crazy woman of large fortune, who, however, would have nothing to say to
LINE 137: him. Shortly afterwards Mrs. Jordan died in distressed circumstances
LINE 138: in Paris. The Duke of Cumberland was probably the most unpopular man in
LINE 139: England. Hideously ugly, with a distorted eye, he was bad-tempered
LINE 140: and vindictive in private, a violent reactionary in politics, and was
LINE 141: subsequently suspected of murdering his valet and of having carried
LINE 142: on an amorous intrigue of an extremely scandalous kind. He had lately
LINE 143: married a German Princess, but there were as yet no children by the
LINE 144: marriage. The Duke of Sussex had mildly literary tastes and collected
LINE 145: books. He had married Lady Augusta Murray, by whom he had two children,
LINE 146: but the marriage, under the Royal Marriages Act, was declared void. On
LINE 147: Lady Augusta's death, he married Lady Cecilia Buggin; she changed her
LINE 148: name to Underwood, but this marriage also was void. Of the Duke of
LINE 149: Cambridge, the youngest of the brothers, not very much was known. He
LINE 150: lived in Hanover, wore a blonde wig, chattered and fidgeted a great
LINE 151: deal, and was unmarried.
LINE 152: Besides his seven sons, George III had five surviving daughters. Of
LINE 153: these, two--the Queen of Wurtemberg and the Duchess of Gloucester--were
LINE 154: married and childless. The three unmarried princesses--Augusta,
LINE 155: Elizabeth, and Sophia--were all over forty.
LINE 156: III
LINE 157: The fourth son of George III was Edward, Duke of Kent. He was now fifty
LINE 158: years of age--a tall, stout, vigorous man, highly-coloured, with bushy
LINE 159: eyebrows, a bald top to his head, and what hair he had carefully dyed a
LINE 160: glossy black. His dress was extremely neat, and in his whole appearance
LINE 161: there was a rigidity which did not belie his character. He had spent
LINE 162: his early life in the army--at Gibraltar, in Canada, in the West
LINE 163: Indies--and, under the influence of military training, had become at
LINE 164: first a disciplinarian and at last a martinet. In 1802, having been sent
LINE 165: to Gibraltar to restore order in a mutinous garrison, he was recalled
LINE 166: for undue severity, and his active career had come to an end. Since then
LINE 167: he had spent his life regulating his domestic arrangements with great
LINE 168: exactitude, busying himself with the affairs of his numerous dependents,
LINE 169: designing clocks, and struggling to restore order to his finances, for,
LINE 170: in spite of his being, as someone said who knew him well "regle comme du
LINE 171: papier a musique," and in spite of an income of L24,000 a year, he
LINE 172: was hopelessly in debt. He had quarrelled with most of his brothers,
LINE 173: particularly with the Prince Regent, and it was only natural that he
LINE 174: should have joined the political Opposition and become a pillar of the
LINE 175: Whigs.
LINE 176: What his political opinions may actually have been is open to doubt; it
LINE 177: has often been asserted that he was a Liberal, or even a Radical; and,
LINE 178: if we are to believe Robert Owen, he was a necessitarian Socialist. His
LINE 179: relations with Owen--the shrewd, gullible, high-minded, wrong-headed,
LINE 180: illustrious and preposterous father of Socialism and Co-operation--were
LINE 181: curious and characteristic. He talked of visiting the Mills at New
LINE 182: Lanark, he did, in fact, preside at one of Owen's public meetings;
LINE 183: he corresponded with him on confidential terms, and he even (so Owen
LINE 184: assures us) returned, after his death, from "the sphere of spirits" to
LINE 185: give encouragement to the Owenites on earth. "In an especial manner,"
LINE 186: says Owen, "I have to name the very anxious feelings of the spirit of
LINE 187: his Royal Highness the Late Duke of Kent (who early informed me
LINE 188: that there were no titles in the spititual spheres into which he had
LINE 189: entered), to benefit, not a class, a sect, a party, or any particular
LINE 190: country, but the whole of the human race, through futurity." "His whole
LINE 191: spirit-proceeding with me has been most beautiful," Owen adds, "making
LINE 192: his own appointments; and never in one instance has this spirit not
LINE 193: been punctual to the minute he had named." But Owen was of a sanguine
LINE 194: temperament. He also numbered among his proselytes President Jefferson,
LINE 195: Prince Metternich, and Napoleon; so that some uncertainty must still
LINE 196: linger over the Duke of Kent's views. But there is no uncertainty about
LINE 197: another circumstance: his Royal Highness borrowed from Robert Owen, on
LINE 198: various occasions, various sums of money which were never repaid and
LINE 199: amounted in all to several hundred pounds.
LINE 200: After the death of the Princess Charlotte it was clearly important, for
LINE 201: more than one reason, that the Duke of Kent should marry. From the point
LINE 202: of view of the nation, the lack of heirs in the reigning family seemed
LINE 203: to make the step almost obligatory; it was also likely to be highly
LINE 204: expedient from the point of view of the Duke. To marry as a public
LINE 205: duty, for the sake of the royal succession, would surely deserve some
LINE 206: recognition from a grateful country. When the Duke of York had married
LINE 207: he had received a settlement of L25,000 a year. Why should not the Duke
LINE 208: of Kent look forward to an equal sum? But the situation was not quite
LINE 209: simple. There was the Duke of Clarence to be considered; he was the
LINE 210: elder brother, and, if HE married, would clearly have the prior claim.
LINE 211: On the other hand, if the Duke of Kent married, it was important
LINE 212: to remember that he would be making a serious sacrifice: a lady was
LINE 213: involved.
LINE 214: The Duke, reflecting upon all these matters with careful attention,
LINE 215: happened, about a month after his niece's death, to visit Brussels, and
LINE 216: learnt that Mr. Creevey was staying in the town. Mr. Creevey was a close
LINE 217: friend of the leading Whigs and an inveterate gossip; and it occurred
LINE 218: to the Duke that there could be no better channel through which to
LINE 219: communicate his views upon the situation to political circles at home.
LINE 220: Apparently it did not occur to him that Mr. Creevey was malicious and
LINE 221: might keep a diary. He therefore sent for him on some trivial pretext,
LINE 222: and a remarkable conversation ensued.
LINE 223: After referring to the death of the Princess, to the improbability of
LINE 224: the Regent's seeking a divorce, to the childlessness of the Duke of
LINE 225: York, and to the possibility of the Duke of Clarence marrying, the Duke
LINE 226: adverted to his own position. "Should the Duke of Clarence not marry,"
LINE 227: he said, "the next prince in succession is myself, and although I trust
LINE 228: I shall be at all times ready to obey any call my country may make upon
LINE 229: me, God only knows the sacrifice it will be to make, whenever I shall
LINE 230: think it my duty to become a married man. It is now seven and twenty
LINE 231: years that Madame St. Laurent and I have lived together: we are of
LINE 232: the same age, and have been in all climates, and in all difficulties
LINE 233: together, and you may well imagine, Mr. Creevey, the pang it will
LINE 234: occasion me to part with her. I put it to your own feelings--in the
LINE 235: event of any separation between you and Mrs. Creevey... As for Madame
LINE 236: St. Laurent herself, I protest I don't know what is to become of her if
LINE 237: a marriage is to be forced upon me; her feelings are already so agitated
LINE 238: upon the subject." The Duke went on to describe how, one morning, a day
LINE 239: or two after the Princess Charlotte's death, a paragraph had appeared in
LINE 240: the Morning Chronicle, alluding to the possibility of his marriage. He
LINE 241: had received the newspaper at breakfast together with his letters, and
LINE 242: "I did as is my constant practice, I threw the newspaper across the
LINE 243: table to Madame St. Laurent, and began to open and read my letters. I
LINE 244: had not done so but a very short time, when my attention was called to
LINE 245: an extraordinary noise and a strong convulsive movement in Madame St.
LINE 246: Laurent's throat. For a short time I entertained serious apprehensions
LINE 247: for her safety; and when, upon her recovery, I enquired into the
LINE 248: occasion of this attack, she pointed to the article in the Morning
LINE 249: Chronicle."
LINE 250: The Duke then returned to the subject of the Duke of Clarence. "My
LINE 251: brother the Duke of Clarence is the elder brother, and has certainly the
LINE 252: right to marry if he chooses, and I would not interfere with him on any
LINE 253: account. If he wishes to be king--to be married and have children, poor
LINE 254: man--God help him! Let him do so. For myself--I am a man of no ambition,
LINE 255: and wish only to remain as I am... Easter, you know, falls very early
LINE 256: this year--the 22nd of March. If the Duke of Clarence does not take any
LINE 257: step before that time, I must find some pretext to reconcile Madame St.
LINE 258: Laurent to my going to England for a short time. When once there, it
LINE 259: will be easy for me to consult with my friends as to the proper steps to
LINE 260: be taken. Should the Duke of Clarence do nothing before that time as to
LINE 261: marrying it will become my duty, no doubt, to take some measures upon
LINE 262: the subject myself." Two names, the Duke said, had been mentioned in
LINE 263: this connection--those of the Princess of Baden and the Princess of
LINE 264: Saxe-Coburg. The latter, he thought, would perhaps be the better of the
LINE 265: two, from the circumstance of Prince Leopold being so popular with the
LINE 266: nation; but before any other steps were taken, he hoped and expected to
LINE 267: see justice done to Madame St. Laurent. "She is," he explained, "of very
LINE 268: good family, and has never been an actress, and I am the first and only
LINE 269: person who ever lived with her. Her disinterestedness, too, has been
LINE 270: equal to her fidelity. When she first came to me it was upon L100 a
LINE 271: year. That sum was afterwards raised to L400 and finally to L1000; but
LINE 272: when my debts made it necessary for me to sacrifice a great part of my
LINE 273: income, Madame St. Laurent insisted upon again returning to her income
LINE 274: of L400 a year. If Madame St. Laurent is to return to live amongst her
LINE 275: friends, it must be in such a state of independence as to command their
LINE 276: respect. I shall not require very much, but a certain number of servants
LINE 277: and a carriage are essentials." As to his own settlement, the Duke
LINE 278: observed that he would expect the Duke of York's marriage to be
LINE 279: considered the precedent. "That," he said, "was a marriage for the
LINE 280: succession, and L25,000 for income was settled, in addition to all his
LINE 281: other income, purely on that account. I shall be contented with the same
LINE 282: arrangement, without making any demands grounded on the difference of
LINE 283: the value of money in 1792 and at present. As for the payment of my
LINE 284: debts," the Duke concluded, "I don't call them great. The nation, on
LINE 285: the contrary, is greatly my debtor." Here a clock struck, and seemed
LINE 286: to remind the Duke that he had an appointment; he rose, and Mr. Creevey
LINE 287: left him.
LINE 288: Who could keep such a communication secret? Certainly not Mr. Creevey.
LINE 289: He hurried off to tell the Duke of Wellington, who was very much amused,
LINE 290: and he wrote a long account of it to Lord Sefton, who received the
LINE 291: letter "very apropos," while a surgeon was sounding his bladder to
LINE 292: ascertain whether he had a stone. "I never saw a fellow more astonished
LINE 293: than he was," wrote Lord Sefton in his reply, "at seeing me laugh as
LINE 294: soon as the operation was over. Nothing could be more first-rate than
LINE 295: the royal Edward's ingenuousness. One does not know which to admire
LINE 296: most--the delicacy of his attachment to Madame St. Laurent, the
LINE 297: refinement of his sentiments towards the Duke of Clarence, or his own
LINE 298: perfect disinterestedness in pecuniary matters."
LINE 299: As it turned out, both the brothers decided to marry. The Duke of Kent,
LINE 300: selecting the Princess of Saxe-Coburg in preference to the Princess
LINE 301: of Baden, was united to her on May 29, 1818. On June 11, the Duke of
LINE 302: Clarence followed suit with a daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.
LINE 303: But they were disappointed in their financial expectations; for though
LINE 304: the Government brought forward proposals to increase their allowances,
LINE 305: together with that of the Duke of Cumberland, the motions were defeated
LINE 306: in the House of Commons. At this the Duke of Wellington was not
LINE 307: surprised. "By God!" he said, "there is a great deal to be said
LINE 308: about that. They are the damnedest millstones about the necks of
LINE 309: any Government that can be imagined. They have insulted--PERSONALLY
LINE 310: insulted--two-thirds of the gentlemen of England, and how can it be
LINE 311: wondered at that they take their revenge upon them in the House of
LINE 312: Commons? It is their only opportunity, and I think, by God! they are
LINE 313: quite right to use it." Eventually, however, Parliament increased the
LINE 314: Duke of Kent's annuity by L6000. The subsequent history of Madame St.
LINE 315: Laurent has not transpired.
LINE 316: IV
LINE 317: The new Duchess of Kent, Victoria Mary Louisa, was a daughter of
LINE 318: Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a sister of Prince Leopold.
LINE 319: The family was an ancient one, being a branch of the great House of
LINE 320: Wettin, which since the eleventh century had ruled over the March of
LINE 321: Meissen on the Elbe. In the fifteenth century the whole possessions of
LINE 322: the House had been divided between the Albertine and Ernestine branches:
LINE 323: from the former descended the electors and kings of Saxony; the latter,
LINE 324: ruling over Thuringia, became further subdivided into five branches,
LINE 325: of which the duchy of Saxe-Coburg was one. This principality was very
LINE 326: small, containing about 60,000 inhabitants, but it enjoyed independent
LINE 327: and sovereign rights. During the disturbed years which followed the
LINE 328: French Revolution, its affairs became terribly involved. The Duke was
LINE 329: extravagant, and kept open house for the swarms of refugees, who fled
LINE 330: eastward over Germany as the French power advanced. Among these was the
LINE 331: Prince of Leiningen, an elderly beau, whose domains on the Moselle
LINE 332: had been seized by the French, but who was granted in compensation
LINE 333: the territory of Amorbach in Lower Franconia. In 1803 he married the
LINE 334: Princess Victoria, at that time seventeen years of age. Three years
LINE 335: later Duke Francis died a ruined man. The Napoleonic harrow passed over
LINE 336: Saxe-Coburg. The duchy was seized by the French, and the ducal family
LINE 337: were reduced to beggary, almost to starvation. At the same time the
LINE 338: little principality of Amorbach was devastated by the French, Russian,
LINE 339: and Austrian armies, marching and counter-marching across it. For years
LINE 340: there was hardly a cow in the country, nor enough grass to feed a
LINE 341: flock of geese. Such was the desperate plight of the family which, a
LINE 342: generation later, was to have gained a foothold in half the reigning
LINE 343: Houses of Europe. The Napoleonic harrow had indeed done its work, the
LINE 344: seed was planted; and the crop would have surprised Napoleon. Prince
LINE 345: Leopold, thrown upon his own resources at fifteen, made a career for
LINE 346: himself and married the heiress of England. The Princess of Leiningen,
LINE 347: struggling at Amorbach with poverty, military requisitions, and a
LINE 348: futile husband, developed an independence of character and a tenacity of
LINE 349: purpose which were to prove useful in very different circumstances. In
LINE 350: 1814, her husband died, leaving her with two children and the regency
LINE 351: of the principality. After her brother's marriage with the Princess
LINE 352: Charlotte, it was proposed that she should marry the Duke of Kent; but
LINE 353: she declined, on the ground that the guardianship of her children and
LINE 354: the management of her domains made other ties undesirable. The Princess
LINE 355: Charlotte's death, however, altered the case; and when the Duke of Kent
LINE 356: renewed his offer, she accepted it. She was thirty-two years old--short,
LINE 357: stout, with brown eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, cheerful and voluble,
LINE 358: and gorgeously attired in rustling silks and bright velvets.
LINE 359: She was certainly fortunate in her contented disposition; for she was
LINE 360: fated, all through her life, to have much to put up with. Her second
LINE 361: marriage, with its dubious prospects, seemed at first to be chiefly a
LINE 362: source of difficulties and discomforts. The Duke, declaring that he was
LINE 363: still too poor to live in England, moved about with uneasy precision
LINE 364: through Belgium and Germany, attending parades and inspecting barracks
LINE 365: in a neat military cap, while the English notabilities looked askance,
LINE 366: and the Duke of Wellington dubbed him the Corporal. "God damme!" he
LINE 367: exclaimed to Mr. Creevey, "d'ye know what his sisters call him? By God!
LINE 368: they call him Joseph Surface!" At Valenciennes, where there was a
LINE 369: review and a great dinner, the Duchess arrived with an old and
LINE 370: ugly lady-in-waiting, and the Duke of Wellington found himself in a
LINE 371: difficulty. "Who the devil is to take out the maid of honour?" he kept
LINE 372: asking; but at last he thought of a solution. "Damme, Freemantle, find
LINE 373: out the mayor and let him do it." So the Mayor of Valenciennes was
LINE 374: brought up for the purpose, and--so we learn from Mr. Creevey--"a
LINE 375: capital figure he was." A few days later, at Brussels, Mr. Creevey
LINE 376: himself had an unfortunate experience. A military school was to be
LINE 377: inspected--before breakfast. The company assembled; everything was
LINE 378: highly satisfactory; but the Duke of Kent continued for so long
LINE 379: examining every detail and asking meticulous question after meticulous
LINE 380: question, that Mr. Creevey at last could bear it no longer, and
LINE 381: whispered to his neighbour that he was damned hungry. The Duke of
LINE 382: Wellington heard him, and was delighted. "I recommend you," he said,
LINE 383: "whenever you start with the royal family in a morning, and particularly
LINE 384: with THE CORPORAL, always to breakfast first." He and his staff, it
LINE 385: turned out, had taken that precaution, and the great man amused himself,
LINE 386: while the stream of royal inquiries poured on, by pointing at Mr.
LINE 387: Creevey from time to time with the remark, "Voila le monsieur qui n'a
LINE 388: pas dejeune!"
LINE 389: Settled down at last at Amorbach, the time hung heavily on the Duke's
LINE 390: hands. The establishment was small, the country was impoverished; even
LINE 391: clock-making grew tedious at last. He brooded--for in spite of his piety
LINE 392: the Duke was not without a vein of superstition--over the prophecy of
LINE 393: a gipsy at Gibraltar who told him that he was to have many losses and
LINE 394: crosses, that he was to die in happiness, and that his only child was
LINE 395: to be a great queen. Before long it became clear that a child was to be
LINE 396: expected: the Duke decided that it should be born in England. Funds were
LINE 397: lacking for the journey, but his determination was not to be set aside.
LINE 398: Come what might, he declared, his child must be English-born. A carriage
LINE 399: was hired, and the Duke himself mounted the box. Inside were the
LINE 400: Duchess, her daughter Feodora, a girl of fourteen, with maids, nurses,
LINE 401: lap-dogs, and canaries. Off they drove--through Germany, through
LINE 402: France: bad roads, cheap inns, were nothing to the rigorous Duke and the
LINE 403: equable, abundant Duchess. The Channel was crossed, London was reached
LINE 404: in safety. The authorities provided a set of rooms in Kensington Palace;
LINE 405: and there, on May 24, 1819, a female infant was born.
