LINE 1: I
LINE 2: The child who, in these not very impressive circumstances, appeared
LINE 3: in the world, received but scant attention. There was small reason to
LINE 4: foresee her destiny. The Duchess of Clarence, two months before,
LINE 5: had given birth to a daughter, this infant, indeed, had died almost
LINE 6: immediately; but it seemed highly probable that the Duchess would
LINE 7: again become a mother; and so it actually fell out. More than this,
LINE 8: the Duchess of Kent was young, and the Duke was strong; there was every
LINE 9: likelihood that before long a brother would follow, to snatch her faint
LINE 10: chance of the succession from the little princess.
LINE 11: Nevertheless, the Duke had other views: there were prophecies... At any
LINE 12: rate, he would christen the child Elizabeth, a name of happy augury. In
LINE 13: this, however, he reckoned without the Regent, who, seeing a chance
LINE 14: of annoying his brother, suddenly announced that he himself would be
LINE 15: present at the baptism, and signified at the same time that one of the
LINE 16: godfathers was to be the Emperor Alexander of Russia. And so when the
LINE 17: ceremony took place, and the Archbishop of Canterbury asked by what name
LINE 18: he was to baptise the child, the Regent replied "Alexandria." At
LINE 19: this the Duke ventured to suggest that another name might be added.
LINE 20: "Certainly," said the Regent; "Georgina?" "Or Elizabeth?" said the Duke.
LINE 21: There was a pause, during which the Archbishop, with the baby in his
LINE 22: lawn sleeves, looked with some uneasiness from one Prince to the other.
LINE 23: "Very well, then," said the Regent at last, "call her after her mother.
LINE 24: But Alexandrina must come first." Thus, to the disgust of her father,
LINE 25: the child was christened Alexandrina Victoria.
LINE 26: The Duke had other subjects of disgust. The meagre grant of the Commons
LINE 27: had by no means put an end to his financial distresses. It was to be
LINE 28: feared that his services were not appreciated by the nation. His debts
LINE 29: continued to grow. For many years he had lived upon L7000 a year;
LINE 30: but now his expenses were exactly doubled; he could make no further
LINE 31: reductions; as it was, there was not a single servant in his meagre
LINE 32: grant establishment who was idle for a moment from morning to night. He
LINE 33: poured out his griefs in a long letter to Robert Owen, whose sympathy
LINE 34: had the great merit of being practical. "I now candidly state," he
LINE 35: wrote, "that, after viewing the subject in every possible way, I am
LINE 36: satisfied that, to continue to live in England, even in the quiet way
LINE 37: in which we are going on, WITHOUT SPLENDOUR, and WITHOUT SHOW, NOTHING
LINE 38: SHORT OF DOUBLING THE SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS WILL DO, REDUCTION BEING
LINE 39: IMPOSSIBLE." It was clear that he would be obliged to sell his house for
LINE 40: L51,300, if that failed, he would go and live on the Continent. "If my
LINE 41: services are useful to my country, it surely becomes THOSE WHO HAVE THE
LINE 42: POWER to support me in substantiating those just claims I have for the
LINE 43: very extensive losses and privations I have experienced, during the very
LINE 44: long period of my professional servitude in the Colonies; and if this
LINE 45: is not attainable, IT IS A CLEAR PROOF TO ME THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE NOT
LINE 46: APPRECIATED; and under that impression I shall not scruple, in DUE time,
LINE 47: to resume my retirement abroad, when the Duchess and myself shall have
LINE 48: fulfilled our duties in establishing the ENGLISH birth of my child, and
LINE 49: giving it material nutriment on the soil of Old England; and which we
LINE 50: shall certainly repeat, if Providence destines, to give us any further
LINE 51: increase of family."
LINE 52: In the meantime, he decided to spend the winter at Sidmouth, "in order,"
LINE 53: he told Owen, "that the Duchess may have the benefit of tepid
LINE 54: sea bathing, and our infant that of sea air, on the fine coast of
LINE 55: Devonshire, during the months of the year that are so odious in London."
LINE 56: In December the move was made. With the new year, the Duke remembered
LINE 57: another prophecy. In 1820, a fortune-teller had told him, two members
LINE 58: of the Royal Family would die. Who would they be? He speculated on
LINE 59: the various possibilities: The King, it was plain, could not live much
LINE 60: longer; and the Duchess of York had been attacked by a mortal disease.
LINE 61: Probably it would be the King and the Duchess of York; or perhaps the
LINE 62: King and the Duke of York; or the King and the Regent. He himself was
LINE 63: one of the healthiest men in England. "My brothers," he declared, "are
LINE 64: not so strong as I am; I have lived a regular life. I shall outlive them
LINE 65: all. The crown will come to me and my children." He went out for a
LINE 66: walk, and got his feet wet. On coming home, he neglected to change his
LINE 67: stockings. He caught cold, inflammation of the lungs set in, and on
LINE 68: January 22 he was a dying man. By a curious chance, young Dr. Stockmar
LINE 69: was staying in the house at the time; two years before, he had stood
LINE 70: by the death-bed of the Princess Charlotte; and now he was watching
LINE 71: the Duke of Kent in his agony. On Stockmar's advice, a will was hastily
LINE 72: prepared. The Duke's earthly possessions were of a negative character;
LINE 73: but it was important that the guardianship of the unwitting child,
LINE 74: whose fortunes were now so strangely changing, should be assured to
LINE 75: the Duchess. The Duke was just able to understand the document, and to
LINE 76: append his signature. Having inquired whether his writing was perfectly
LINE 77: clear, he became unconscious, and breathed his last on the following
LINE 78: morning! Six days later came the fulfilment of the second half of the
LINE 79: gipsy's prophecy. The long, unhappy, and inglorious life of George the
LINE 80: Third of England was ended.
LINE 81: II
LINE 82: Such was the confusion of affairs at Sidmouth, that the Duchess found
LINE 83: herself without the means of returning to London. Prince Leopold hurried
LINE 84: down, and himself conducted his sister and her family, by slow and
LINE 85: bitter stages, to Kensington. The widowed lady, in her voluminous
LINE 86: blacks, needed all her equanimity to support her. Her prospects were
LINE 87: more dubious than ever. She had L6000 a year of her own; but her
LINE 88: husband's debts loomed before her like a mountain. Soon she learnt that
LINE 89: the Duchess of Clarence was once more expecting a child. What had she to
LINE 90: look forward to in England? Why should she remain in a foreign country,
LINE 91: among strangers, whose language she could not speak, whose customs she
LINE 92: could not understand? Surely it would be best to return to Amorbach,
LINE 93: and there, among her own people, bring up her daughters in economical
LINE 94: obscurity. But she was an inveterate optimist; she had spent her life
LINE 95: in struggles, and would not be daunted now; and besides, she adored her
LINE 96: baby. "C'est mon bonheur, mes delices, mon existence," she declared;
LINE 97: the darling should be brought up as an English princess, whatever lot
LINE 98: awaited her. Prince Leopold came forward nobly with an offer of an
LINE 99: additional L3000 a year; and the Duchess remained at Kensington.
LINE 100: The child herself was extremely fat, and bore a remarkable resemblance
LINE 101: to her grandfather. "C'est l'image du feu Roi!" exclaimed the Duchess.
LINE 102: "C'est le Roi Georges en jupons," echoed the surrounding ladies, as the
LINE 103: little creature waddled with difficulty from one to the other.
LINE 104: Before long, the world began to be slightly interested in the nursery at
LINE 105: Kensington. When, early in 1821, the Duchess of Clarence's second child,
LINE 106: the Princess Elizabeth, died within three months of its birth, the
LINE 107: interest increased. Great forces and fierce antagonisms seemed to be
LINE 108: moving, obscurely, about the royal cradle. It was a time of faction
LINE 109: and anger, of violent repression and profound discontent. A powerful
LINE 110: movement, which had for long been checked by adverse circumstances, was
LINE 111: now spreading throughout the country. New passions, new desires, were
LINE 112: abroad; or rather old passions and old desires, reincarnated with a new
LINE 113: potency: love of freedom, hatred of injustice, hope for the future
LINE 114: of man. The mighty still sat proudly in their seats, dispensing their
LINE 115: ancient tyranny; but a storm was gathering out of the darkness, and
LINE 116: already there was lightning in the sky. But the vastest forces must
LINE 117: needs operate through frail human instruments; and it seemed for many
LINE 118: years as if the great cause of English liberalism hung upon the life of
LINE 119: the little girl at Kensington. She alone stood between the country and
LINE 120: her terrible uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, the hideous embodiment of
LINE 121: reaction. Inevitably, the Duchess of Kent threw in her lot with her
LINE 122: husband's party; Whig leaders, Radical agitators, rallied round her; she
LINE 123: was intimate with the bold Lord Durham, she was on friendly terms with
LINE 124: the redoubtable O'Connell himself. She received Wilberforce-though, to
LINE 125: be sure, she did not ask him to sit down. She declared in public that
LINE 126: she put her faith in "the liberties of the People." It was certain that
LINE 127: the young Princess would be brought up in the way that she should go;
LINE 128: yet there, close behind the throne, waiting, sinister, was the Duke of
LINE 129: Cumberland. Brougham, looking forward into the future in his scurrilous
LINE 130: fashion, hinted at dreadful possibilities. "I never prayed so heartily
LINE 131: for a Prince before," he wrote, on hearing that George IV had been
LINE 132: attacked by illness. "If he had gone, all the troubles of these villains
LINE 133: (the Tory Ministers) went with him, and they had Fred. I (the Duke of
LINE 134: York) their own man for his life. He (Fred. I) won't live long either;
LINE 135: that Prince of Blackguards, 'Brother William,' is as bad a life, so
LINE 136: we come in the course of nature to be ASSASSINATED by King Ernest I or
LINE 137: Regent Ernest (the Duke of Cumberland)." Such thoughts were not peculiar
LINE 138: to Brougham; in the seething state of public feeling, they constantly
LINE 139: leapt to the surface; and, even so late as the year previous to her
LINE 140: accession, the Radical newspapers were full of suggestions that the
LINE 141: Princess Victoria was in danger from the machinations of her wicked
LINE 142: uncle.
LINE 143: But no echo of these conflicts and forebodings reached the little
LINE 144: Drina--for so she was called in the family circle--as she played with
LINE 145: her dolls, or scampered down the passages, or rode on the donkey her
LINE 146: uncle York had given her along the avenues of Kensington Gardens
LINE 147: The fair-haired, blue-eyed child was idolised by her nurses, and her
LINE 148: mother's ladies, and her sister Feodora; and for a few years there was
LINE 149: danger, in spite of her mother's strictness, of her being spoilt. From
LINE 150: time to time, she would fly into a violent passion, stamp her little
LINE 151: foot, and set everyone at defiance; whatever they might say, she would
LINE 152: not learn her letters--no, she WOULD NOT; afterwards, she was very
LINE 153: sorry, and burst into tears; but her letters remained unlearnt. When
LINE 154: she was five years old, however, a change came, with the appearance
LINE 155: of Fraulein Lehzen. This lady, who was the daughter of a Hanoverian
LINE 156: clergyman, and had previously been the Princess Feodora's governess,
LINE 157: soon succeeded in instilling a new spirit into her charge. At first,
LINE 158: indeed, she was appalled by the little Princess's outbursts of temper;
LINE 159: never in her life, she declared, had she seen such a passionate
LINE 160: and naughty child. Then she observed something else; the child was
LINE 161: extraordinarily truthful; whatever punishment might follow, she never
LINE 162: told a lie. Firm, very firm, the new governess yet had the sense to see
LINE 163: that all the firmness in the world would be useless, unless she could
LINE 164: win her way into little Drina's heart. She did so, and there were no
LINE 165: more difficulties. Drina learnt her letters like an angel; and she
LINE 166: learnt other things as well. The Baroness de Spath taught her how
LINE 167: to make little board boxes and decorate them with tinsel and painted
LINE 168: flowers; her mother taught her religion. Sitting in the pew every Sunday
LINE 169: morning, the child of six was seen listening in rapt attention to the
LINE 170: clergyman's endless sermon, for she was to be examined upon it in
LINE 171: the afternoon. The Duchess was determined that her daughter, from the
LINE 172: earliest possible moment, should be prepared for her high station in a
LINE 173: way that would commend itself to the most respectable; her good,
LINE 174: plain, thrifty German mind recoiled with horror and amazement from the
LINE 175: shameless junketings at Carlton House; Drina should never be allowed to
LINE 176: forget for a moment the virtues of simplicity, regularity, propriety,
LINE 177: and devotion. The little girl, however, was really in small need of such
LINE 178: lessons, for she was naturally simple and orderly, she was pious without
LINE 179: difficulty, and her sense of propriety was keen. She understood very
LINE 180: well the niceties of her own position. When, a child of six, Lady Jane
LINE 181: Ellice was taken by her grandmother to Kensington Palace, she was put
LINE 182: to play with the Princess Victoria, who was the same age as herself. The
LINE 183: young visitor, ignorant of etiquette, began to make free with the toys
LINE 184: on the floor, in a way which was a little too familiar; but "You must
LINE 185: not touch those," she was quickly told, "they are mine; and I may
LINE 186: call you Jane, but you must not call me Victoria." The Princess's most
LINE 187: constant playmate was Victoire, the daughter of Sir John Conroy, the
LINE 188: Duchess's major-domo. The two girls were very fond of one another; they
LINE 189: would walk hand in hand together in Kensington Gardens. But little Drina
LINE 190: was perfectly aware for which of them it was that they were followed, at
LINE 191: a respectful distance, by a gigantic scarlet flunkey.
LINE 192: Warm-hearted, responsive, she loved her dear Lehzen, and she loved her
LINE 193: dear Feodora, and her dear Victoire, and her dear Madame de Spath.
LINE 194: And her dear Mamma, of course, she loved her too; it was her duty; and
LINE 195: yet--she could not tell why it was--she was always happier when she was
LINE 196: staying with her Uncle Leopold at Claremont. There old Mrs. Louis, who,
LINE 197: years ago, had waited on her Cousin Charlotte, petted her to her heart's
LINE 198: content; and her uncle himself was wonderfully kind to her, talking to
LINE 199: her seriously and gently, almost as if she were a grown-up person. She
LINE 200: and Feodora invariably wept when the too-short visit was over, and they
LINE 201: were obliged to return to the dutiful monotony, and the affectionate
LINE 202: supervision of Kensington. But sometimes when her mother had to stay at
LINE 203: home, she was allowed to go out driving all alone with her dear Feodora
LINE 204: and her dear Lehzen, and she could talk and look as she liked, and it
LINE 205: was very delightful.
LINE 206: The visits to Claremont were frequent enough; but one day, on a special
LINE 207: occasion, she paid one of a rarer and more exciting kind. When she was
LINE 208: seven years old, she and her mother and sister were asked by the King
LINE 209: to go down to Windsor. George IV, who had transferred his fraternal
LINE 210: ill-temper to his sister-in-law and her family, had at last grown tired
LINE 211: of sulking, and decided to be agreeable. The old rip, bewigged and
LINE 212: gouty, ornate and enormous, with his jewelled mistress by his side and
LINE 213: his flaunting court about him, received the tiny creature who was one
LINE 214: day to hold in those same halls a very different state. "Give me your
LINE 215: little paw," he said; and two ages touched. Next morning, driving in his
LINE 216: phaeton with the Duchess of Gloucester, he met the Duchess of Kent and
LINE 217: her child in the Park. "Pop her in," were his orders, which, to the
LINE 218: terror of the mother and the delight of the daughter, were immediately
LINE 219: obeyed. Off they dashed to Virginia Water, where there was a great
LINE 220: barge, full of lords and ladies fishing, and another barge with a band;
LINE 221: and the King ogled Feodora, and praised her manners, and then turned to
LINE 222: his own small niece. "What is your favourite tune? The band shall play
LINE 223: it." "God save the King, sir," was the instant answer. The Princess's
LINE 224: reply has been praised as an early example of a tact which was
LINE 225: afterwards famous. But she was a very truthful child, and perhaps it was
LINE 226: her genuine opinion.
LINE 227: III
LINE 228: In 1827 the Duke of York, who had found some consolation for the loss of
LINE 229: his wife in the sympathy of the Duchess of Rutland, died, leaving behind
LINE 230: him the unfinished immensity of Stafford House and L200,000 worth of
LINE 231: debts. Three years later George IV also disappeared, and the Duke of
LINE 232: Clarence reigned in his stead. The new Queen, it was now clear, would
LINE 233: in all probability never again be a mother; the Princess Victoria,
LINE 234: therefore, was recognised by Parliament as heir-presumptive; and the
LINE 235: Duchess of Kent, whose annuity had been doubled five years previously,
LINE 236: was now given an additional L10,000 for the maintenance of the Princess,
LINE 237: and was appointed regent, in case of the death of the King before the
LINE 238: majority of her daughter. At the same time a great convulsion took
LINE 239: place in the constitution of the State. The power of the Tories, who had
LINE 240: dominated England for more than forty years, suddenly began to crumble.
LINE 241: In the tremendous struggle that followed, it seemed for a moment as if
LINE 242: the tradition of generations might be snapped, as if the blind tenacity
LINE 243: of the reactionaries and the determined fury of their enemies could have
LINE 244: no other issue than revolution. But the forces of compromise triumphed:
LINE 245: the Reform Bill was passed. The centre of gravity in the constitution
LINE 246: was shifted towards the middle classes; the Whigs came into power; and
LINE 247: the complexion of the Government assumed a Liberal tinge. One of the
LINE 248: results of this new state of affairs was a change in the position of
LINE 249: the Duchess of Kent and her daughter. From being the protegees of an
LINE 250: opposition clique, they became assets of the official majority of the
LINE 251: nation. The Princess Victoria was henceforward the living symbol of the
LINE 252: victory of the middle classes.
LINE 253: The Duke of Cumberland, on the other hand, suffered a corresponding
LINE 254: eclipse: his claws had been pared by the Reform Act. He grew
LINE 255: insignificant and almost harmless, though his ugliness remained; he was
LINE 256: the wicked uncle still--but only of a story.
LINE 257: The Duchess's own liberalism was not very profound. She followed
LINE 258: naturally in the footsteps of her husband, repeating with conviction the
LINE 259: catchwords of her husband's clever friends and the generalisations
LINE 260: of her clever brother Leopold. She herself had no pretensions to
LINE 261: cleverness; she did not understand very much about the Poor Law and the
LINE 262: Slave Trade and Political Economy; but she hoped that she did her
LINE 263: duty; and she hoped--she ardently hoped--that the same might be said of
LINE 264: Victoria. Her educational conceptions were those of Dr. Arnold, whose
LINE 265: views were just then beginning to permeate society. Dr. Arnold's object
LINE 266: was, first and foremost, to make his pupils "in the highest and truest
LINE 267: sense of the words, Christian gentlemen," intellectual refinements might
LINE 268: follow. The Duchess felt convinced that it was her supreme duty in life
LINE 269: to make quite sure that her daughter should grow up into a Christian
LINE 270: queen. To this task she bent all her energies; and, as the child
LINE 271: developed, she flattered herself that her efforts were not unsuccessful.
LINE 272: When the Princess was eleven, she desired the Bishops of London and
LINE 273: Lincoln to submit her daughter to an examination, and report upon the
LINE 274: progress that had been made. "I feel the time to be now come," the
LINE 275: Duchess explained, in a letter obviously drawn up by her own hand, "that
LINE 276: what has been done should be put to some test, that if anything has been
LINE 277: done in error of judgment it may be corrected, and that the plan for the
LINE 278: future should be open to consideration and revision... I attend almost
LINE 279: always myself every lesson, or a part; and as the lady about the
LINE 280: Princess is a competent person, she assists Her in preparing Her
LINE 281: lessons, for the various masters, as I resolved to act in that manner
LINE 282: so as to be Her Governess myself. When she was at a proper age she
LINE 283: commenced attending Divine Service regularly with me, and I have
LINE 284: every feeling that she has religion at Her heart, that she is morally
LINE 285: impressed with it to that degree, that she is less liable to error by
LINE 286: its application to her feelings as a Child capable of reflection."
LINE 287: "The general bent of Her character," added the Duchess, "is strength
LINE 288: of intellect, capable of receiving with ease, information, and with a
LINE 289: peculiar readiness in coming to a very just and benignant decision
LINE 290: on any point Her opinion is asked on. Her adherence to truth is of so
LINE 291: marked a character that I feel no apprehension of that Bulwark being
LINE 292: broken down by any circumstances." The Bishops attended at the Palace,
LINE 293: and the result of their examination was all that could be wished. "In
LINE 294: answering a great variety of questions proposed to her," they reported,
LINE 295: "the Princess displayed an accurate knowledge of the most important
LINE 296: features of Scripture History, and of the leading truths and precepts of
LINE 297: the Christian Religion as taught by the Church of England, as well as an
LINE 298: acquaintance with the Chronology and principal facts of English History
LINE 299: remarkable in so young a person. To questions in Geography, the use
LINE 300: of the Globes, Arithmetic, and Latin Grammar, the answers which the
LINE 301: Princess returned were equally satisfactory." They did not believe that
LINE 302: the Duchess's plan of education was susceptible of any improvement; and
LINE 303: the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was also consulted, came to the same
LINE 304: gratifying conclusion.
LINE 305: One important step, however, remained to be taken. So far, as the
LINE 306: Duchess explained to the Bishops, the Princess had been kept in
LINE 307: ignorance of the station that she was likely to fill. "She is aware of
LINE 308: its duties, and that a Sovereign should live for others; so that when
LINE 309: Her innocent mind receives the impression of Her future fate, she
LINE 310: receives it with a mind formed to be sensible of what is to be expected
LINE 311: from Her, and it is to be hoped, she will be too well grounded in Her
LINE 312: principles to be dazzled with the station she is to look to." In the
LINE 313: following year it was decided that she should be enlightened on
LINE 314: this point. The well--known scene followed: the history lesson, the
LINE 315: genealogical table of the Kings of England slipped beforehand by the
LINE 316: governess into the book, the Princess's surprise, her inquiries, her
LINE 317: final realisation of the facts. When the child at last understood, she
LINE 318: was silent for a moment, and then she spoke: "I will be good," she
LINE 319: said. The words were something more than a conventional protestation,
LINE 320: something more than the expression of a superimposed desire; they
LINE 321: were, in their limitation and their intensity, their egotism and their
LINE 322: humility, an instinctive summary of the dominating qualities of a life.
LINE 323: "I cried much on learning it," her Majesty noted long afterwards. No
LINE 324: doubt, while the others were present, even her dear Lehzen, the little
LINE 325: girl kept up her self-command; and then crept away somewhere to ease her
LINE 326: heart of an inward, unfamiliar agitation, with a handkerchief, out of
LINE 327: her mother's sight.
LINE 328: But her mother's sight was by no means an easy thing to escape. Morning
LINE 329: and evening, day and night, there was no relaxation of the maternal
LINE 330: vigilance. The child grew into the girl, the girl into the young woman;
LINE 331: but still she slept in her mother's bedroom; still she had no place
LINE 332: allowed her where she might sit or work by herself. An extraordinary
LINE 333: watchfulness surrounded her every step: up to the day of her accession,
LINE 334: she never went downstairs without someone beside her holding her hand.
LINE 335: Plainness and regularity ruled the household. The hours, the days, the
LINE 336: years passed slowly and methodically by. The dolls--the innumerable
LINE 337: dolls, each one so neatly dressed, each one with its name so
LINE 338: punctiliously entered in the catalogue--were laid aside, and a little
LINE 339: music and a little dancing took their place. Taglioni came, to give
LINE 340: grace and dignity to the figure, and Lablache, to train the piping
LINE 341: treble upon his own rich bass. The Dean of Chester, the official
LINE 342: preceptor, continued his endless instruction in Scripture history, while
LINE 343: the Duchess of Northumberland, the official governess, presided over
LINE 344: every lesson with becoming solemnity. Without doubt, the Princess's main
LINE 345: achievement during her school-days was linguistic. German was naturally
LINE 346: the first language with which she was familiar; but English and French
LINE 347: quickly followed; and she became virtually trilingual, though her
LINE 348: mastery of English grammar remained incomplete. At the same time, she
LINE 349: acquired a working knowledge of Italian and some smattering of Latin.
LINE 350: Nevertheless, she did not read very much. It was not an occupation that
LINE 351: she cared for; partly, perhaps, because the books that were given her
LINE 352: were all either sermons, which were very dull, or poetry, which was
LINE 353: incomprehensible. Novels were strictly forbidden. Lord Durham persuaded
LINE 354: her mother to get her some of Miss Martineau's tales, illustrating the
LINE 355: truths of Political Economy, and they delighted her; but it is to be
LINE 356: feared that it was the unaccustomed pleasure of the story that filled
LINE 357: her mind, and that she never really mastered the theory of exchanges or
LINE 358: the nature of rent.
LINE 359: It was her misfortune that the mental atmosphere which surrounded her
LINE 360: during these years of adolescence was almost entirely feminine. No
LINE 361: father, no brother, was there to break in upon the gentle monotony of
LINE 362: the daily round with impetuosity, with rudeness, with careless laughter
LINE 363: and wafts of freedom from the outside world. The Princess was never
LINE 364: called by a voice that was loud and growling; never felt, as a matter
LINE 365: of course, a hard rough cheek on her own soft one; never climbed a wall
LINE 366: with a boy. The visits to Claremont--delicious little escapes into male
LINE 367: society--came to an end when she was eleven years old and Prince Leopold
LINE 368: left England to be King of the Belgians. She loved him still; he was
LINE 369: still "il mio secondo padre or, rather, solo padre, for he is indeed
LINE 370: like my real father, as I have none;" but his fatherliness now came to
LINE 371: her dimly and indirectly, through the cold channel of correspondence.
LINE 372: Henceforward female duty, female elegance, female enthusiasm, hemmed
LINE 373: her completely in; and her spirit, amid the enclosing folds, was hardly
LINE 374: reached by those two great influences, without which no growing life can
LINE 375: truly prosper--humour and imagination. The Baroness Lehzen--for she had
LINE 376: been raised to that rank in the Hanoverian nobility by George IV before
LINE 377: he died--was the real centre of the Princess's world. When Feodora
LINE 378: married, when Uncle Leopold went to Belgium, the Baroness was left
LINE 379: without a competitor. The Princess gave her mother her dutiful regards;
LINE 380: but Lehzen had her heart. The voluble, shrewd daughter of the pastor
LINE 381: in Hanover, lavishing her devotion on her royal charge, had reaped her
LINE 382: reward in an unbounded confidence and a passionate adoration. The girl
LINE 383: would have gone through fire for her "PRECIOUS Lehzen," the "best and
LINE 384: truest friend," she declared, that she had had since her birth. Her
LINE 385: journal, begun when she was thirteen, where she registered day by day
LINE 386: the small succession of her doings and her sentiments, bears on every
LINE 387: page of it the traces of the Baroness and her circumambient influence.
LINE 388: The young creature that one sees there, self-depicted in ingenuous
LINE 389: clarity, with her sincerity, her simplicity, her quick affections and
LINE 390: pious resolutions, might almost have been the daughter of a German
LINE 391: pastor herself. Her enjoyments, her admirations, her engouements were
LINE 392: of the kind that clothed themselves naturally in underlinings and
LINE 393: exclamation marks. "It was a DELIGHTFUL ride. We cantered a good deal.
LINE 394: SWEET LITTLE ROSY WENT BEAUTIFULLY!! We came home at a 1/4 past 1... At
LINE 395: 20 minutes to 7 we went out to the Opera... Rubini came on and sang a
LINE 396: song out of 'Anna Boulena' QUITE BEAUTIFULLY. We came home at 1/2
LINE 397: past 11." In her comments on her readings, the mind of the Baroness is
LINE 398: clearly revealed. One day, by some mistake, she was allowed to take up
LINE 399: a volume of memoirs by Fanny Kemble. "It is certainly very pertly and
LINE 400: oddly written. One would imagine by the style that the authoress must be
LINE 401: very pert, and not well bred; for there are so many vulgar expressions
LINE 402: in it. It is a great pity that a person endowed with so much talent, as
LINE 403: Mrs. Butler really is, should turn it to so little account and publish a
LINE 404: book which is so full of trash and nonsense which can only do her harm.
LINE 405: I stayed up till 20 minutes past 9." Madame de Sevigne's letters, which
LINE 406: the Baroness read aloud, met with more approval. "How truly elegant and
LINE 407: natural her style is! It is so full of naivete, cleverness, and grace."
LINE 408: But her highest admiration was reserved for the Bishop of Chester's
LINE 409: 'Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew.' "It is a very fine
LINE 410: book indeed. Just the sort of one I like; which is just plain and
LINE 411: comprehensible and full of truth and good feeling. It is not one
LINE 412: of those learned books in which you have to cavil at almost every
LINE 413: paragraph. Lehzen gave it me on the Sunday that I took the Sacrament." A
LINE 414: few weeks previously she had been confirmed, and she described the event
LINE 415: as follows: "I felt that my confirmation was one of the most solemn and
LINE 416: important events and acts in my life; and that I trusted that it might
LINE 417: have a salutary effect on my mind. I felt deeply repentant for all what
LINE 418: I had done which was wrong and trusted in God Almighty to strengthen my
LINE 419: heart and mind; and to forsake all that is bad and follow all that is
LINE 420: virtuous and right. I went with the firm determination to become a true
LINE 421: Christian, to try and comfort my dear Mamma in all her griefs, trials,
LINE 422: and anxieties, and to become a dutiful and affectionate daughter to her.
LINE 423: Also to be obedient to DEAR Lehzen, who has done so much for me. I was
LINE 424: dressed in a white lace dress, with a white crepe bonnet with a wreath
LINE 425: of white roses round it. I went in the chariot with my dear Mamma and
LINE 426: the others followed in another carriage." One seems to hold in one's
LINE 427: hand a small smooth crystal pebble, without a flaw and without a
LINE 428: scintillation, and so transparent that one can see through it at a
LINE 429: glance.
LINE 430: Yet perhaps, after all, to the discerning eye, the purity would not be
LINE 431: absolute. The careful searcher might detect, in the virgin soil, the
LINE 432: first faint traces of an unexpected vein. In that conventual existence
LINE 433: visits were exciting events; and, as the Duchess had many relatives,
LINE 434: they were not infrequent; aunts and uncles would often appear from
LINE 435: Germany, and cousins too. When the Princess was fourteen she was
LINE 436: delighted by the arrival of a couple of boys from Wurtemberg, the
LINE 437: Princes Alexander and Ernst, sons of her mother's sister and the
LINE 438: reigning duke. "They are both EXTREMELY TALL," she noted, "Alexander
LINE 439: is VERY HANDSOME, and Ernst has a VERY KIND EXPRESSION. They are both
LINE 440: extremely AMIABLE." And their departure filled her with corresponding
LINE 441: regrets. "We saw them get into the barge, and watched them sailing away
LINE 442: for some time on the beach. They were so amiable and so pleasant to
LINE 443: have in the house; they were ALWAYS SATISFIED, ALWAYS GOOD-HUMOURED;
LINE 444: Alexander took such care of me in getting out of the boat, and rode next
LINE 445: to me; so did Ernst." Two years later, two other cousins arrived, the
LINE 446: Princes Ferdinand and Augustus. "Dear Ferdinand," the Princess wrote,
LINE 447: "has elicited universal admiration from all parties... He is so very
LINE 448: unaffected, and has such a very distinguished appearance and carriage.
LINE 449: They are both very dear and charming young men. Augustus is very
LINE 450: amiable, too, and, when known, shows much good sense." On another
LINE 451: occasion, "Dear Ferdinand came and sat near me and talked so dearly and
LINE 452: sensibly. I do SO love him. Dear Augustus sat near me and talked with
LINE 453: me, and he is also a dear good young man, and is very handsome." She
LINE 454: could not quite decide which was the handsomer of the two. "On the
LINE 455: whole," she concluded, "I think Ferdinand handsomer than Augustus, his
LINE 456: eyes are so beautiful, and he has such a lively clever expression; BOTH
LINE 457: have such a sweet expression; Ferdinand has something QUITE BEAUTIFUL in
LINE 458: his expression when he speaks and smiles, and he is SO good." However,
LINE 459: it was perhaps best to say that they were "both very handsome and VERY
LINE 460: DEAR." But shortly afterwards two more cousins arrived, who threw all
LINE 461: the rest into the shade. These were the Princes Ernest and Albert, sons
LINE 462: of her mother's eldest brother, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg. This time
LINE 463: the Princess was more particular in her observations. "Ernest," she
LINE 464: remarked, "is as tall as Ferdinand and Augustus; he has dark hair, and
LINE 465: fine dark eyes and eyebrows, but the nose and mouth are not good; he has
LINE 466: a most kind, honest, and intelligent expression in his countenance,
LINE 467: and has a very good figure. Albert, who is just as tall as Ernest but
LINE 468: stouter, is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as
LINE 469: mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a
LINE 470: very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance
LINE 471: is his expression, which is most delightful; c'est a la fois full of
LINE 472: goodness and sweetness, and very clever and intelligent." "Both my
LINE 473: cousins," she added, "are so kind and good; they are much more formes
LINE 474: and men of the world than Augustus; they speak English very well, and I
LINE 475: speak it with them. Ernest will be 18 years old on the 21st of June, and
LINE 476: Albert 17 on the 26th of August. Dear Uncle Ernest made me the present
LINE 477: of a most delightful Lory, which is so tame that it remains on your
LINE 478: hand and you may put your finger into its beak, or do anything with
LINE 479: it, without its ever attempting to bite. It is larger than Mamma's grey
LINE 480: parrot." A little later, "I sat between my dear cousins on the sofa and
LINE 481: we looked at drawings. They both draw very well, particularly Albert,
LINE 482: and are both exceedingly fond of music; they play very nicely on the
LINE 483: piano. The more I see them the more I am delighted with them, and the
LINE 484: more I love them... It is delightful to be with them; they are so fond
LINE 485: of being occupied too; they are quite an example for any young person."
LINE 486: When, after a stay of three weeks, the time came for the young men
LINE 487: and their father to return to Germany, the moment of parting was a
LINE 488: melancholy one. "It was our last HAPPY HAPPY breakfast, with this dear
LINE 489: Uncle and those DEAREST beloved cousins, whom I DO love so VERY VERY
LINE 490: dearly; MUCH MORE DEARLY than any other cousins in the WORLD. Dearly as
LINE 491: I love Ferdinand, and also good Augustus, I love Ernest and Albert MORE
LINE 492: than them, oh yes, MUCH MORE... They have both learnt a good deal, and
LINE 493: are very clever, naturally clever, particularly Albert, who is the most
LINE 494: reflecting of the two, and they like very much talking about serious
LINE 495: and instructive things and yet are so VERY VERY merry and gay and happy,
LINE 496: like young people ought to be; Albert always used to have some fun and
LINE 497: some clever witty answer at breakfast and everywhere; he used to play
LINE 498: and fondle Dash so funnily too... Dearest Albert was playing on the
LINE 499: piano when I came down. At 11 dear Uncle, my DEAREST BELOVED cousins,
LINE 500: and Charles, left us, accompanied by Count Kolowrat. I embraced both my
LINE 501: dearest cousins most warmly, as also my dear Uncle. I cried bitterly,
LINE 502: very bitterly." The Princes shared her ecstasies and her italics
LINE 503: between them; but it is clear enough where her secret preference
LINE 504: lay. "Particularly Albert!" She was just seventeen; and deep was the
LINE 505: impression left upon that budding organism by the young man's charm
LINE 506: and goodness and accomplishments, and his large blue eyes and beautiful
LINE 507: nose, and his sweet mouth and fine teeth.
LINE 508: IV
LINE 509: King William could not away with his sister-in-law, and the Duchess
LINE 510: fully returned his antipathy. Without considerable tact and considerable
LINE 511: forbearance their relative positions were well calculated to cause
LINE 512: ill-feeling; and there was very little tact in the composition of the
LINE 513: Duchess, and no forbearance at all in that of his Majesty. A bursting,
LINE 514: bubbling old gentleman, with quarterdeck gestures, round rolling eyes,
LINE 515: and a head like a pineapple, his sudden elevation to the throne after
LINE 516: fifty-six years of utter insignificance had almost sent him crazy. His
LINE 517: natural exuberance completely got the best of him; he rushed about doing
LINE 518: preposterous things in an extraordinary manner, spreading amusement
LINE 519: and terror in every direction, and talking all the time. His tongue
LINE 520: was decidedly Hanoverian, with its repetitions, its catchwords--"That's
LINE 521: quite another thing! That's quite another thing!"--its rattling
LINE 522: indomitability, its loud indiscreetness. His speeches, made repeatedly
LINE 523: at the most inopportune junctures, and filled pell-mell with all the
LINE 524: fancies and furies that happened at the moment to be whisking about
LINE 525: in his head, were the consternation of Ministers. He was one part
LINE 526: blackguard, people said, and three parts buffoon; but those who knew
LINE 527: him better could not help liking him--he meant well; and he was really
LINE 528: good-humoured and kind-hearted, if you took him the right way. If you
LINE 529: took him the wrong way, however, you must look out for squalls, as the
LINE 530: Duchess of Kent discovered.
LINE 531: She had no notion of how to deal with him--could not understand him in
LINE 532: the least. Occupied with her own position, her own responsibilities, her
LINE 533: duty, and her daughter, she had no attention to spare for the peppery
LINE 534: susceptibilities of a foolish, disreputable old man. She was the mother
LINE 535: of the heiress of England; and it was for him to recognise the fact--to
LINE 536: put her at once upon a proper footing--to give her the precedence of a
LINE 537: dowager Princess of Wales, with a large annuity from the privy purse.
LINE 538: It did not occur to her that such pretensions might be galling to a king
LINE 539: who had no legitimate child of his own, and who yet had not altogether
LINE 540: abandoned the hope of having one. She pressed on, with bulky vigour,
LINE 541: along the course she had laid out. Sir John Conroy, an Irishman with
LINE 542: no judgment and a great deal of self-importance, was her intimate
LINE 543: counsellor, and egged her on. It was advisable that Victoria should
LINE 544: become acquainted with the various districts of England, and through
LINE 545: several summers a succession of tours--in the West, in the Midlands, in
LINE 546: Wales--were arranged for her. The intention of the plan was excellent,
LINE 547: but its execution was unfortunate. The journeys, advertised in
LINE 548: the Press, attracting enthusiastic crowds, and involving official
LINE 549: receptions, took on the air of royal progresses. Addresses were
LINE 550: presented by loyal citizens, the delighted Duchess, swelling in sweeping
LINE 551: feathers and almost obliterating the diminutive Princess, read aloud,
LINE 552: in her German accent, gracious replies prepared beforehand by Sir
LINE 553: John, who, bustling and ridiculous, seemed to be mingling the roles
LINE 554: of major-domo and Prime Minister. Naturally the King fumed over his
LINE 555: newspaper at Windsor. "That woman is a nuisance!" he exclaimed. Poor
LINE 556: Queen Adelaide, amiable though disappointed, did her best to smooth
LINE 557: things down, changed the subject, and wrote affectionate letters to
LINE 558: Victoria; but it was useless. News arrived that the Duchess of Kent,
LINE 559: sailing in the Solent, had insisted that whenever her yacht appeared it
LINE 560: should be received by royal salutes from all the men-of-war and all the
LINE 561: forts. The King declared that these continual poppings must cease; the
LINE 562: Premier and the First Lord of the Admiralty were consulted; and they
LINE 563: wrote privately to the Duchess, begging her to waive her rights. But
LINE 564: she would not hear of it; Sir John Conroy was adamant. "As her Royal
LINE 565: Highness's CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER," he said, "I cannot recommend her
LINE 566: to give way on this point." Eventually the King, in a great state of
LINE 567: excitement, issued a special Order in Council, prohibiting the firing
LINE 568: of royal salutes to any ships except those which carried the reigning
LINE 569: sovereign or his consort on board.
LINE 570: When King William quarrelled with his Whig Ministers the situation grew
LINE 571: still more embittered, for now the Duchess, in addition to her other
LINE 572: shortcomings, was the political partisan of his enemies. In 1836 he
LINE 573: made an attempt to prepare the ground for a match between the Princess
LINE 574: Victoria and one of the sons of the Prince of Orange, and at the same
LINE 575: time did his best to prevent the visit of the young Coburg princes to
LINE 576: Kensington. He failed in both these objects; and the only result of
LINE 577: his efforts was to raise the anger of the King of the Belgians, who,
LINE 578: forgetting for a moment his royal reserve, addressed an indignant letter
LINE 579: on the subject to his niece. "I am really ASTONISHED," he wrote, "at
LINE 580: the conduct of your old Uncle the King; this invitation of the Prince
LINE 581: of Orange and his sons, this forcing him on others, is very
LINE 582: extraordinary... Not later than yesterday I got a half-official
LINE 583: communication from England, insinuating that it would be HIGHLY
LINE 584: desirable that the visit of YOUR relatives SHOULD NOT TAKE PLACE
LINE 585: THIS YEAR--qu'en dites-vous? The relations of the Queen and the King,
LINE 586: therefore, to the God-knows-what degree, are to come in shoals and rule
LINE 587: the land, when YOUR RELATIONS are to be FORBIDDEN the country, and
LINE 588: that when, as you know, the whole of your relations have ever been very
LINE 589: dutiful and kind to the King. Really and truly I never heard or saw
LINE 590: anything like it, and I hope it will a LITTLE ROUSE YOUR SPIRIT;
LINE 591: now that slavery is even abolished in the British Colonies, I do not
LINE 592: comprehend WHY YOUR LOT ALONE SHOULD BE TO BE KEPT A WHITE LITTLE SLAVEY
LINE 593: IN ENGLAND, for the pleasure of the Court, who never bought you, as I am
LINE 594: not aware of their ever having gone to any expense on that head, or
LINE 595: the King's ever having SPENT A SIXPENCE FOR YOUR EXISTENCE... Oh,
LINE 596: consistency and political or OTHER HONESTY, where must one look for
LINE 597: you!"
LINE 598: Shortly afterwards King Leopold came to England himself, and his
LINE 599: reception was as cold at Windsor as it was warm at Kensington. "To hear
LINE 600: dear Uncle speak on any subject," the Princess wrote in her diary,
LINE 601: "is like reading a highly instructive book; his conversation is so
LINE 602: enlightened, so clear. He is universally admitted to be one of the first
LINE 603: politicians now extant. He speaks so mildly, yet firmly and impartially,
LINE 604: about politics. Uncle tells me that Belgium is quite a pattern for its
LINE 605: organisation, its industry, and prosperity; the finances are in the
LINE 606: greatest perfection. Uncle is so beloved and revered by his Belgian
LINE 607: subjects, that it must be a great compensation for all his extreme
LINE 608: trouble." But her other uncle by no means shared her sentiments. He
LINE 609: could not, he said, put up with a water-drinker; and King Leopold would
LINE 610: touch no wine. "What's that you're drinking, sir?" he asked him one day
LINE 611: at dinner. "Water, sir." "God damn it, sir!" was the rejoinder. "Why
LINE 612: don't you drink wine? I never allow anybody to drink water at my table."
LINE 613: It was clear that before very long there would be a great explosion; and
LINE 614: in the hot days of August it came. The Duchess and the Princess had
LINE 615: gone down to stay at Windsor for the King's birthday party, and the King
LINE 616: himself, who was in London for the day to prorogue Parliament, paid a
LINE 617: visit at Kensington Palace in their absence. There he found that the
LINE 618: Duchess had just appropriated, against his express orders, a suite of
LINE 619: seventeen apartments for her own use. He was extremely angry, and, when
LINE 620: he returned to Windsor, after greeting the Princess with affection, he
LINE 621: publicly rebuked the Duchess for what she had done. But this was little
LINE 622: to what followed. On the next day was the birthday banquet; there were
LINE 623: a hundred guests; the Duchess of Kent sat on the King's right hand, and
LINE 624: the Princess Victoria opposite. At the end of the dinner, in reply
LINE 625: to the toast of the King's health, he rose, and, in a long, loud,
LINE 626: passionate speech, poured out the vials of his wrath upon the Duchess.
LINE 627: She had, he declared, insulted him--grossly and continually; she had
LINE 628: kept the Princess away from him in the most improper manner; she was
LINE 629: surrounded by evil advisers, and was incompetent to act with propriety
LINE 630: in the high station which she filled; but he would bear it no longer; he
LINE 631: would have her to know he was King; he was determined that his authority
LINE 632: should be respected; henceforward the Princess should attend at every
LINE 633: Court function with the utmost regularity; and he hoped to God that his
LINE 634: life might be spared for six months longer, so that the calamity of a
LINE 635: regency might be avoided, and the functions of the Crown pass directly
LINE 636: to the heiress-presumptive instead of into the hands of the "person now
LINE 637: near him," upon whose conduct and capacity no reliance whatever could
LINE 638: be placed. The flood of vituperation rushed on for what seemed an
LINE 639: interminable period, while the Queen blushed scarlet, the Princess burst
LINE 640: into tears, and the hundred guests sat aghast. The Duchess said not a
LINE 641: word until the tirade was over and the company had retired; then in
LINE 642: a tornado of rage and mortification, she called for her carriage and
LINE 643: announced her immediate return to Kensington. It was only with the
LINE 644: utmost difficulty that some show of a reconciliation was patched up, and
LINE 645: the outraged lady was prevailed upon to put off her departure till the
LINE 646: morrow.
LINE 647: Her troubles, however, were not over when she had shaken the dust
LINE 648: of Windsor from her feet. In her own household she was pursued by
LINE 649: bitterness and vexation of spirit. The apartments at Kensington were
LINE 650: seething with subdued disaffection, with jealousies and animosities
LINE 651: virulently intensified by long years of propinquity and spite.
LINE 652: There was a deadly feud between Sir John Conroy and Baroness Lehzen.
LINE 653: But that was not all. The Duchess had grown too fond of her Major-Domo.
LINE 654: There were familiarities, and one day the Princess Victoria discovered
LINE 655: the fact. She confided what she had seen to the Baroness, and to the
LINE 656: Baroness's beloved ally, Madame de Spath. Unfortunately, Madame de Spath
LINE 657: could not hold her tongue, and was actually foolish enough to reprove
LINE 658: the Duchess; whereupon she was instantly dismissed. It was not so easy
LINE 659: to get rid of the Baroness. That lady, prudent and reserved, maintained
LINE 660: an irreproachable demeanour. Her position was strongly entrenched; she
LINE 661: had managed to secure the support of the King; and Sir John found that
LINE 662: he could do nothing against her. But henceforward the household was
LINE 663: divided into two camps.(*) The Duchess supported Sir John with all the
LINE 664: abundance of her authority; but the Baroness, too, had an adherent who
LINE 665: could not be neglected. The Princess Victoria said nothing, but she had
LINE 666: been much attached to Madame de Spath, and she adored her Lehzen. The
LINE 667: Duchess knew only too well that in this horrid embroilment her daughter
LINE 668: was against her. Chagrin, annoyance, moral reprobation, tossed her
LINE 669: to and fro. She did her best to console herself with Sir John's
LINE 670: affectionate loquacity, or with the sharp remarks of Lady Flora
LINE 671: Hastings, one of her maids of honour, who had no love for the Baroness.
LINE 672: The subject lent itself to satire; for the pastor's daughter, with all
LINE 673: her airs of stiff superiority, had habits which betrayed her origin. Her
LINE 674: passion for caraway seeds, for instance, was uncontrollable. Little bags
LINE 675: of them came over to her from Hanover, and she sprinkled them on her
LINE 676: bread and butter, her cabbage, and even her roast beef. Lady Flora could
LINE 677: not resist a caustic observation; it was repeated to the Baroness, who
LINE 678: pursed her lips in fury, and so the mischief grew.
LINE 679: (*) Greville, IV, 21; and August 15, 1839 (unpublished).
LINE 680: "The cause of the Queen's alienation from the Duchess and
LINE 681: hatred of Conroy, the Duke (of Wellington) said, was
LINE 682: unquestionably owing to her having witnessed some
LINE 683: familiarities between them. What she had seen she repeated
LINE 684: to Baroness Spaeth, and Spaeth not only did not hold her
LINE 685: tongue, but (he thinks) remonstrated with the Duchess
LINE 686: herself on the subject. The consequence was that they got
LINE 687: rid of Spaeth, and they would have got rid of Lehzen, too,
LINE 688: if they had been able, but Lehzen, who knew very well what
LINE 689: was going on, was prudent enough not to commit herself, and
LINE 690: who was, besides, powerfully protected by George IV and
LINE 691: William IV, so that they did not dare to attempt to expel
LINE 692: her."
LINE 693: V
LINE 694: The King had prayed that he might live till his niece was of age; and
LINE 695: a few days before her eighteenth birthday--the date of her legal
LINE 696: majority--a sudden attack of illness very nearly carried him off. He
LINE 697: recovered, however, and the Princess was able to go through her
LINE 698: birthday festivities--a state ball and a drawing-room--with unperturbed
LINE 699: enjoyment. "Count Zichy," she noted in her diary, "is very good-looking
LINE 700: in uniform, but not in plain clothes. Count Waldstein looks remarkably
LINE 701: well in his pretty Hungarian uniform." With the latter young gentleman
LINE 702: she wished to dance, but there was an insurmountable difficulty. "He
LINE 703: could not dance quadrilles, and, as in my station I unfortunately cannot
LINE 704: valse and gallop, I could not dance with him." Her birthday present
LINE 705: from the King was of a pleasing nature, but it led to a painful domestic
LINE 706: scene. In spite of the anger of her Belgian uncle, she had remained upon
LINE 707: good terms with her English one. He had always been very kind to her,
LINE 708: and the fact that he had quarrelled with her mother did not appear to
LINE 709: be a reason for disliking him. He was, she said, "odd, very odd and
LINE 710: singular," but "his intentions were often ill interpreted." He now wrote
LINE 711: her a letter, offering her an allowance of L10,000 a year, which he
LINE 712: proposed should be at her own disposal, and independent of her mother.
LINE 713: Lord Conyngham, the Lord Chamberlain, was instructed to deliver the
LINE 714: letter into the Princess's own hands. When he arrived at Kensington, he
LINE 715: was ushered into the presence of the Duchess and the Princess, and, when
LINE 716: he produced the letter, the Duchess put out her hand to take it. Lord
LINE 717: Conyngham begged her Royal Highness's pardon, and repeated the King's
LINE 718: commands. Thereupon the Duchess drew back, and the Princess took the
LINE 719: letter. She immediately wrote to her uncle, accepting his kind proposal.
LINE 720: The Duchess was much displeased; L4000 a year, she said, would be quite
LINE 721: enough for Victoria; as for the remaining L6000, it would be only proper
LINE 722: that she should have that herself.
LINE 723: King William had thrown off his illness, and returned to his normal
LINE 724: life. Once more the royal circle at Windsor--their Majesties, the elder
LINE 725: Princesses, and some unfortunate Ambassadress or Minister's wife--might
LINE 726: be seen ranged for hours round a mahogany table, while the Queen netted
LINE 727: a purse, and the King slept, occasionally waking from his slumbers to
LINE 728: observe "Exactly so, ma'am, exactly so!" But this recovery was of short
LINE 729: duration. The old man suddenly collapsed; with no specific symptoms
LINE 730: besides an extreme weakness, he yet showed no power of rallying; and it
LINE 731: was clear to everyone that his death was now close at hand.
LINE 732: All eyes, all thoughts, turned towards the Princess Victoria; but she
LINE 733: still remained, shut away in the seclusion of Kensington, a small,
LINE 734: unknown figure, lost in the large shadow of her mother's domination. The
LINE 735: preceding year had in fact been an important one in her development. The
LINE 736: soft tendrils of her mind had for the first time begun to stretch out
LINE 737: towards unchildish things. In this King Leopold encouraged her. After
LINE 738: his return to Brussels, he had resumed his correspondance in a more
LINE 739: serious strain; he discussed the details of foreign politics; he laid
LINE 740: down the duties of kingship; he pointed out the iniquitous foolishness
LINE 741: of the newspaper press. On the latter subject, indeed, he wrote with
LINE 742: some asperity. "If all the editors," he said, "of the papers in the
LINE 743: countries where the liberty of the press exists were to be assembled, we
LINE 744: should have a crew to which you would NOT confide a dog that you would
LINE 745: value, still less your honour and reputation." On the functions of a
LINE 746: monarch, his views were unexceptionable. "The business of the highest
LINE 747: in a State," he wrote, "is certainly, in my opinion, to act with great
LINE 748: impartiality and a spirit of justice for the good of all." At the
LINE 749: same time the Princess's tastes were opening out. Though she was still
LINE 750: passionately devoted to riding and dancing, she now began to have a
LINE 751: genuine love of music as well, and to drink in the roulades and arias
LINE 752: of the Italian opera with high enthusiasm. She even enjoyed reading
LINE 753: poetry--at any rate, the poetry of Sir Walter Scott.
LINE 754: When King Leopold learnt that King William's death was approaching, he
LINE 755: wrote several long letters of excellent advice to his niece. "In every
LINE 756: letter I shall write to you," he said, "I mean to repeat to you, as a
LINE 757: FUNDAMENTAL RULE, TO BE FIRM, AND COURAGEOUS, AND HONEST, AS YOU HAVE
LINE 758: BEEN TILL NOW." For the rest, in the crisis that was approaching, she
LINE 759: was not to be alarmed, but to trust in her "good natural sense and the
LINE 760: TRUTH" of her character; she was to do nothing in a hurry; to hurt
LINE 761: no one's amour-propre, and to continue her confidence in the Whig
LINE 762: administration! Not content with letters, however, King Leopold
LINE 763: determined that the Princess should not lack personal guidance, and sent
LINE 764: over to her aid the trusted friend whom, twenty years before, he had
LINE 765: taken to his heart by the death-bed at Claremont. Thus, once again, as
LINE 766: if in accordance with some preordained destiny, the figure of Stockmar
LINE 767: is discernible--inevitably present at a momentous hour.
LINE 768: On June 18, the King was visibly sinking. The Archbishop of Canterbury
LINE 769: was by his side, with all the comforts of the church. Nor did the holy
LINE 770: words fall upon a rebellious spirit; for many years his Majesty had
LINE 771: been a devout believer. "When I was a young man," he once explained at
LINE 772: a public banquet, "as well as I can remember, I believed in nothing but
LINE 773: pleasure and folly--nothing at all. But when I went to sea, got into
LINE 774: a gale, and saw the wonders of the mighty deep, then I believed; and I
LINE 775: have been a sincere Christian ever since." It was the anniversary of the
LINE 776: Battle of Waterloo, and the dying man remembered it. He should be glad
LINE 777: to live, he said, over that day; he would never see another sunset. "I
LINE 778: hope your Majesty may live to see many," said Dr. Chambers. "Oh! that's
LINE 779: quite another thing, that's quite another thing," was the answer. One
LINE 780: other sunset he did live to see; and he died in the early hours of the
LINE 781: following morning. It was on June 20, 1837.
LINE 782: When all was over, the Archbishop and the Lord Chamberlain ordered a
LINE 783: carriage, and drove post-haste from Windsor to Kensington. They arrived
LINE 784: at the Palace at five o'clock, and it was only with considerable
LINE 785: difficulty that they gained admittance. At six the Duchess woke up
LINE 786: her daughter, and told her that the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord
LINE 787: Conyngham were there, and wished to see her. She got out of bed, put on
LINE 788: her dressing-gown, and went, alone, into the room where the messengers
LINE 789: were standing. Lord Conyngham fell on his knees, and officially
LINE 790: announced the death of the King; the Archbishop added some personal
LINE 791: details. Looking at the bending, murmuring dignitaries before her, she
LINE 792: knew that she was Queen of England. "Since it has pleased Providence,"
LINE 793: she wrote that day in her journal, "to place me in this station, I shall
LINE 794: do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young, and
LINE 795: perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure,
LINE 796: that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what
LINE 797: is fit and right than I have." But there was scant time for resolutions
LINE 798: and reflections. At once, affairs were thick upon her. Stockmar came to
LINE 799: breakfast, and gave some good advice. She wrote a letter to her uncle
LINE 800: Leopold, and a hurried note to her sister Feodora. A letter came from
LINE 801: the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne, announcing his approaching arrival.
LINE 802: He came at nine, in full court dress, and kissed her hand. She saw him
LINE 803: alone, and repeated to him the lesson which, no doubt, the faithful
LINE 804: Stockmar had taught her at breakfast. "It has long been my intention to
LINE 805: retain your Lordship and the rest of the present Ministry at the head
LINE 806: of affairs;" whereupon Lord Melbourne again kissed her hand and shortly
LINE 807: after left her. She then wrote a letter of condolence to Queen Adelaide.
LINE 808: At eleven, Lord Melbourne came again; and at half-past eleven she went
LINE 809: downstairs into the red saloon to hold her first Council. The great
LINE 810: assembly of lords and notables, bishops, generals, and Ministers of
LINE 811: State, saw the doors thrown open and a very short, very slim girl in
LINE 812: deep plain mourning come into the room alone and move forward to her
LINE 813: seat with extraordinary dignity and grace; they saw a countenance, not
LINE 814: beautiful, but prepossessing--fair hair, blue prominent eyes, a small
LINE 815: curved nose, an open mouth revealing the upper teeth, a tiny chin,
LINE 816: a clear complexion, and, over all, the strangely mingled signs of
LINE 817: innocence, of gravity, of youth, and of composure; they heard a high
LINE 818: unwavering voice reading aloud with perfect clarity; and then, the
LINE 819: ceremony was over, they saw the small figure rise and, with the same
LINE 820: consummate grace, the same amazing dignity, pass out from among them, as
LINE 821: she had come in, alone.
