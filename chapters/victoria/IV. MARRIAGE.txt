LINE 1: I
LINE 2: It was decidedly a family match. Prince Francis Charles Augustus Albert
LINE 3: Emmanuel of Saxe-Coburg--Gotha--for such was his full title--had been
LINE 4: born just three months after his cousin Victoria, and the same midwife
LINE 5: had assisted at the two births. The children's grandmother, the Dowager
LINE 6: Duchess of Coburg, had from the first looked forward to their marriage,
LINE 7: as they grew up, the Duke, the Duchess of Kent, and King Leopold came
LINE 8: equally to desire it. The Prince, ever since the time when, as a child
LINE 9: of three, his nurse had told him that some day "the little English May
LINE 10: flower" would be his wife, had never thought of marrying anyone else.
LINE 11: When eventually Baron Stockmar himself signified his assent, the affair
LINE 12: seemed as good as settled.
LINE 13: The Duke had one other child--Prince Ernest, Albert's senior by one
LINE 14: year, and heir to the principality. The Duchess was a sprightly and
LINE 15: beautiful woman, with fair hair and blue eyes; Albert was very like her
LINE 16: and was her declared favourite. But in his fifth year he was parted from
LINE 17: her for ever. The ducal court was not noted for the strictness of its
LINE 18: morals; the Duke was a man of gallantry, and it was rumoured that the
LINE 19: Duchess followed her husband's example. There were scandals: one of the
LINE 20: Court Chamberlains, a charming and cultivated man of Jewish extraction,
LINE 21: was talked of; at last there was a separation, followed by a divorce.
LINE 22: The Duchess retired to Paris, and died unhappily in 1831. Her memory was
LINE 23: always very dear to Albert.
LINE 24: He grew up a pretty, clever, and high-spirited boy. Usually
LINE 25: well-behaved, he was, however, sometimes violent. He had a will of
LINE 26: his own, and asserted it; his elder brother was less passionate, less
LINE 27: purposeful, and, in their wrangles, it was Albert who came out top. The
LINE 28: two boys, living for the most part in one or other of the Duke's country
LINE 29: houses, among pretty hills and woods and streams, had been at a very
LINE 30: early age--Albert was less than four--separated from their nurses and
LINE 31: put under a tutor, in whose charge they remained until they went to the
LINE 32: University. They were brought up in a simple and unostentatious manner,
LINE 33: for the Duke was poor and the duchy very small and very insignificant.
LINE 34: Before long it became evident that Albert was a model lad. Intelligent
LINE 35: and painstaking, he had been touched by the moral earnestness of his
LINE 36: generation; at the age of eleven he surprised his father by telling him
LINE 37: that he hoped to make himself "a good and useful man." And yet he was
LINE 38: not over-serious; though, perhaps, he had little humour, he was full
LINE 39: of fun--of practical jokes and mimicry. He was no milksop; he rode, and
LINE 40: shot, and fenced; above all did he delight in being out of doors, and
LINE 41: never was he happier than in his long rambles with his brother through
LINE 42: the wild country round his beloved Rosenau--stalking the deer, admiring
LINE 43: the scenery, and returning laden with specimens for his natural
LINE 44: history collection. He was, besides, passionately fond of music. In one
LINE 45: particular it was observed that he did not take after his father: owing
LINE 46: either to his peculiar upbringing or to a more fundamental idiosyncrasy
LINE 47: he had a marked distaste for the opposite sex. At the age of five, at a
LINE 48: children's dance, he screamed with disgust and anger when a little girl
LINE 49: was led up to him for a partner; and though, later on, he grew more
LINE 50: successful in disguising such feelings, the feelings remained.
LINE 51: The brothers were very popular in Coburg, and, when the time came for
LINE 52: them to be confirmed, the preliminary examination which, according to
LINE 53: ancient custom, was held in public in the "Giants' Hall" of the
LINE 54: Castle, was attended by an enthusiastic crowd of functionaries, clergy,
LINE 55: delegates from the villages of the duchy, and miscellaneous onlookers.
LINE 56: There were also present, besides the Duke and the Dowager Duchess, their
LINE 57: Serene Highnesses the Princes Alexander and Ernest of Wurtemberg,
LINE 58: Prince Leiningen, Princess Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and Princess
LINE 59: Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst. Dr. Jacobi, the Court chaplain, presided at
LINE 60: an altar, simply but appropriately decorated, which had been placed at
LINE 61: the end of the hall; and the proceedings began by the choir singing the
LINE 62: first verse of the hymn, "Come, Holy Ghost." After some introductory
LINE 63: remarks, Dr. Jacobi began the examination. "The dignified and decorous
LINE 64: bearing of the Princes," we are told in a contemporary account,
LINE 65: "their strict attention to the questions, the frankness, decision, and
LINE 66: correctness of their answers, produced a deep impression on the numerous
LINE 67: assembly. Nothing was more striking in their answers than the evidence
LINE 68: they gave of deep feeling and of inward strength of conviction. The
LINE 69: questions put by the examiner were not such as to be met by a simple
LINE 70: 'yes' or 'no.' They were carefully considered in order to give the
LINE 71: audience a clear insight into the views and feelings of,the young
LINE 72: princes. One of the most touching moments was when the examiner asked
LINE 73: the hereditary prince whether he intended steadfastly to hold to the
LINE 74: Evangelical Church, and the Prince answered not only 'Yes!' but added in
LINE 75: a clear and decided tone: 'I and my brother are firmly resolved ever
LINE 76: to remain faithful to the acknowledged truth.' The examination having
LINE 77: lasted an hour, Dr. Jacobi made some concluding observations, followed
LINE 78: by a short prayer; the second and third verses of the opening hymn were
LINE 79: sung; and the ceremony was over. The Princes, stepping down from the
LINE 80: altar, were embraced by the Duke and the Dowager Duchess; after which
LINE 81: the loyal inhabitants of Coburg dispersed, well satisfied with their
LINE 82: entertainment."
LINE 83: Albert's mental development now proceeded apace. In his seventeenth year
LINE 84: he began a careful study of German literature and German philosophy.
LINE 85: He set about, he told his tutor, "to follow the thoughts of the great
LINE 86: Klopstock into their depths--though in this, for the most part," he
LINE 87: modestly added, "I do not succeed." He wrote an essay on the "Mode
LINE 88: of Thought of the Germans, and a Sketch of the History of German
LINE 89: Civilisation," "making use," he said, "in its general outlines, of
LINE 90: the divisions which the treatment of the subject itself demands," and
LINE 91: concluding with "a retrospect of the shortcomings of our time, with an
LINE 92: appeal to every one to correct those shortcomings in his own case, and
LINE 93: thus set a good example to others." Placed for some months under the
LINE 94: care of King Leopold at Brussels, he came under the influence of Adolphe
LINE 95: Quetelet, a mathematical professor, who was particularly interested
LINE 96: in the application of the laws of probability to political and moral
LINE 97: phenomena; this line of inquiry attracted the Prince, and the friendship
LINE 98: thus begun continued till the end of his life. From Brussels he went to
LINE 99: the University of Bonn, where he was speedily distinguished both by his
LINE 100: intellectual and his social activities; his energies were absorbed
LINE 101: in metaphysics, law, political economy, music, fencing, and amateur
LINE 102: theatricals. Thirty years later his fellow--students recalled with
LINE 103: delight the fits of laughter into which they had been sent by Prince
LINE 104: Albert's mimicry. The verve with which his Serene Highness reproduced
LINE 105: the tones and gestures of one of the professors who used to point to
LINE 106: a picture of a row of houses in Venice with the remark, "That is the
LINE 107: Ponte-Realte," and of another who fell down in a race and was obliged to
LINE 108: look for his spectacles, was especially appreciated.
LINE 109: After a year at Bonn, the time had come for a foreign tour, and Baron
LINE 110: Stockmar arrived from England to accompany the Prince on an expedition
LINE 111: to Italy. The Baron had been already, two years previously, consulted
LINE 112: by King Leopold as to his views upon the proposed marriage of Albert
LINE 113: and Victoria. His reply had been remarkable. With a characteristic
LINE 114: foresight, a characteristic absence of optimism, a characteristic sense
LINE 115: of the moral elements in the situation, Stockmar had pointed out what
LINE 116: were, in his opinion, the conditions essential to make the marriage a
LINE 117: success. Albert, he wrote, "was a fine young fellow, well grown for his
LINE 118: age, with agreeable and valuable qualities; and it was probable that
LINE 119: in a few years he would turn out a strong handsome man, of a kindly,
LINE 120: simple, yet dignified demeanour. Thus, externally, he possesses
LINE 121: all that pleases the sex, and at all times and in all countries must
LINE 122: please." Supposing, therefore, that Victoria herself was in favour of
LINE 123: the marriage, the further question arose as to whether Albert's mental
LINE 124: qualities were such as to fit him for the position of husband of the
LINE 125: Queen of England. On this point, continued the Baron, one heard much to
LINE 126: his credit; the Prince was said to be discreet and intelligent; but
LINE 127: all such judgments were necessarily partial, and the Baron preferred to
LINE 128: reserve his opinion until he could come to a trustworthy conclusion from
LINE 129: personal observation. And then he added: "But all this is not enough.
LINE 130: The young man ought to have not merely great ability, but a right
LINE 131: ambition, and great force of will as well. To pursue for a lifetime a
LINE 132: political career so arduous demands more than energy and inclination--it
LINE 133: demands also that earnest frame of mind which is ready of its own accord
LINE 134: to sacrifice mere pleasure to real usefulness. If he is not satisfied
LINE 135: hereafter with the consciousness of having achieved one of the most
LINE 136: influential positions in Europe, how often will he feel tempted to
LINE 137: repent his adventure! If he does not from the very outset accept it as a
LINE 138: vocation of grave responsibility, on the efficient performance of
LINE 139: which his honour and happiness depend, there is small likelihood of his
LINE 140: succeeding."
LINE 141: Such were the views of Stockmar on the qualifications necessary for the
LINE 142: due fulfilment of that destiny which Albert's family had marked out for
LINE 143: him; and he hoped, during the tour in Italy, to come to some conclusion
LINE 144: as to how far the prince possessed them. Albert on his side was much
LINE 145: impressed by the Baron, whom he had previously seen but rarely; he
LINE 146: also became acquainted, for the first time in his life, with a young
LINE 147: Englishman, Lieutenant Francis Seymour, who had been engaged to
LINE 148: accompany him, whom he found sehr liebens-wurdig, and with whom he
LINE 149: struck up a warm friendship. He delighted in the galleries and scenery
LINE 150: of Florence, though with Rome he was less impressed. "But for some
LINE 151: beautiful palaces," he said, "it might just as well be any town in
LINE 152: Germany." In an interview with Pope Gregory XVI, he took the opportunity
LINE 153: of displaying his erudition. When the Pope observed that the Greeks
LINE 154: had taken their art from the Etruscans, Albert replied that, on the
LINE 155: contrary, in his opinion, they had borrowed from the Egyptians: his
LINE 156: Holiness politely acquiesced. Wherever he went he was eager to increase
LINE 157: his knowledge, and, at a ball in Florence, he was observed paying no
LINE 158: attention whatever to the ladies, and deep in conversation with the
LINE 159: learned Signor Capponi. "Voila un prince dont nous pouvons etre fiers,"
LINE 160: said the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who was standing by: "la belle danseuse
LINE 161: l'attend, le savant l'occupe."
LINE 162: On his return to Germany, Stockmar's observations, imparted to King
LINE 163: Leopold, were still critical. Albert, he said, was intelligent,
LINE 164: kind, and amiable; he was full of the best intentions and the noblest
LINE 165: resolutions, and his judgment was in many things beyond his years. But
LINE 166: great exertion was repugnant to him; he seemed to be too willing to
LINE 167: spare himself, and his good resolutions too often came to nothing. It
LINE 168: was particularly unfortunate that he took not the slightest interest
LINE 169: in politics, and never read a newspaper. In his manners, too, there was
LINE 170: still room for improvement. "He will always," said the Baron, "have more
LINE 171: success with men than with women, in whose society he shows too little
LINE 172: empressement, and is too indifferent and retiring." One other feature
LINE 173: of the case was noted by the keen eye of the old physician: the Prince's
LINE 174: constitution was not a strong one. Yet, on the whole, he was favourable
LINE 175: to the projected marriage. But by now the chief obstacle seemed to lie
LINE 176: in another quarter, Victoria was apparently determined to commit herself
LINE 177: to nothing. And so it happened that when Albert went to England he had
LINE 178: made up his mind to withdraw entirely from the affair. Nothing would
LINE 179: induce him, he confessed to a friend, to be kept vaguely waiting;
LINE 180: he would break it all off at once. His reception at Windsor threw an
LINE 181: entirely new light upon the situation. The wheel of fortune turned
LINE 182: with a sudden rapidity; and he found, in the arms of Victoria, the
LINE 183: irrevocable assurance of his overwhelming fate.
LINE 184: II
LINE 185: He was not in love with her. Affection, gratitude, the natural reactions
LINE 186: to the unqualified devotion of a lively young cousin who was also
LINE 187: a queen--such feelings possessed him, but the ardours of reciprocal
LINE 188: passion were not his. Though he found that he liked Victoria very much,
LINE 189: what immediately interested him in his curious position was less her
LINE 190: than himself. Dazzled and delighted, riding, dancing, singing, laughing,
LINE 191: amid the splendours of Windsor, he was aware of a new sensation--the
LINE 192: stirrings of ambition in his breast. His place would indeed be a high,
LINE 193: an enviable one! And then, on the instant, came another thought. The
LINE 194: teaching of religion, the admonitions of Stockmar, his own inmost
LINE 195: convictions, all spoke with the same utterance. He would not be there to
LINE 196: please himself, but for a very different purpose--to do good. He must be
LINE 197: "noble, manly, and princely in all things," he would have "to live and
LINE 198: to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his new country;" to "use his
LINE 199: powers and endeavours for a great object--that of promoting the welfare
LINE 200: of multitudes of his fellowmen." One serious thought led on to another.
LINE 201: The wealth and the bustle of the English Court might be delightful for
LINE 202: the moment, but, after all, it was Coburg that had his heart. "While
LINE 203: I shall be untiring," he wrote to his grandmother, "in my efforts and
LINE 204: labours for the country to which I shall in future belong, and where
LINE 205: I am called to so high a position, I shall never cease ein treuer
LINE 206: Deutscher, Coburger, Gothaner zu sein." And now he must part from Coburg
LINE 207: for ever! Sobered and sad, he sought relief in his brother Ernest's
LINE 208: company; the two young men would shut themselves up together, and,
LINE 209: sitting down at the pianoforte, would escape from the present and the
LINE 210: future in the sweet familiar gaiety of a Haydn duet.
LINE 211: They returned to Germany; and while Albert, for a few farewell months,
LINE 212: enjoyed, for the last time, the happiness of home, Victoria, for the
LINE 213: last time, resumed her old life in London and Windsor. She corresponded
LINE 214: daily with her future husband in a mingled flow of German and English;
LINE 215: but the accustomed routine reasserted itself; the business and the
LINE 216: pleasures of the day would brook no interruption; Lord M. was once
LINE 217: more constantly beside her; and the Tories were as intolerable as ever.
LINE 218: Indeed, they were more so. For now, in these final moments, the old feud
LINE 219: burst out with redoubled fury. The impetuous sovereign found, to her
LINE 220: chagrin, that there might be disadvantages in being the declared enemy
LINE 221: of one of the great parties in the State. On two occasions, the Tories
LINE 222: directly thwarted her in a matter on which she had set her heart. She
LINE 223: wished her husband's rank to be axed by statute, and their opposition
LINE 224: prevented it. She wished her husband to receive a settlement from the
LINE 225: nation of L50,000 a year; and, again owing to the Tories, he was only
LINE 226: allowed L30,000. It was too bad. When the question was discussed in
LINE 227: Parliament, it had been pointed out that the bulk of the population was
LINE 228: suffering from great poverty, and that L30,000 was the whole revenue of
LINE 229: Coburg; but her uncle Leopold had been given L50,000, and it would
LINE 230: be monstrous to give Albert less. Sir Robert Peel--it might have been
LINE 231: expected--had had the effrontery to speak and vote for the smaller sum.
LINE 232: She was very angry; and determined to revenge herself by omitting to
LINE 233: invite a single Tory to her wedding. She would make an exception in
LINE 234: favour of old Lord Liverpool, but even the Duke of Wellington she
LINE 235: refused to ask. When it was represented to her that it would amount to
LINE 236: a national scandal if the Duke were absent from her wedding, she was
LINE 237: angrier than ever. "What! That old rebel! I won't have him:" she
LINE 238: was reported to have said. Eventually she was induced to send him an
LINE 239: invitation; but she made no attempt to conceal the bitterness of her
LINE 240: feelings, and the Duke himself was only too well aware of all that had
LINE 241: passed.
LINE 242: Nor was it only against the Tories that her irritation rose. As the time
LINE 243: for her wedding approached, her temper grew steadily sharper and
LINE 244: more arbitrary. Queen Adelaide annoyed her. King Leopold, too, was
LINE 245: "ungracious" in his correspondence; "Dear Uncle," she told Albert, "is
LINE 246: given to believe that he must rule the roost everywhere. However," she
LINE 247: added with asperity, "that is not a necessity." Even Albert himself
LINE 248: was not impeccable. Engulfed in Coburgs, he failed to appreciate
LINE 249: the complexity of English affairs. There were difficulties about his
LINE 250: household. He had a notion that he ought not to be surrounded by
LINE 251: violent Whigs; very likely, but he would not understand that the only
LINE 252: alternatives to violent Whigs were violent Tories; and it would be
LINE 253: preposterous if his Lords and Gentlemen were to be found voting against
LINE 254: the Queen's. He wanted to appoint his own Private Secretary. But how
LINE 255: could he choose the right person? Lord M. was obviously best qualified
LINE 256: to make the appointment; and Lord M. had decided that the Prince should
LINE 257: take over his own Private Secretary--George Anson, a staunch Whig.
LINE 258: Albert protested, but it was useless; Victoria simply announced that
LINE 259: Anson was appointed, and instructed Lehzen to send the Prince an
LINE 260: explanation of the details of the case.
LINE 261: Then, again, he had written anxiously upon the necessity of maintaining
LINE 262: unspotted the moral purity of the Court. Lord M's pupil considered that
LINE 263: dear Albert was strait-laced, and, in a brisk Anglo-German missive, set
LINE 264: forth her own views. "I like Lady A. very much," she told him, "only she
LINE 265: is a little strict awl particular, and too severe towards others, which
LINE 266: is not right; for I think one ought always to be indulgent towards other
LINE 267: people, as I always think, if we had not been well taken care of, we
LINE 268: might also have gone astray. That is always my feeling. Yet it is always
LINE 269: right to show that one does not like to see what is obviously wrong; but
LINE 270: it is very dangerous to be too severe, and I am certain that as a rule
LINE 271: such people always greatly regret that in their youth they have not been
LINE 272: so careful as they ought to have been. I have explained this so badly
LINE 273: and written it so badly, that I fear you will hardly be able to make it
LINE 274: out."
LINE 275: On one other matter she was insistent. Since the affair of Lady Flora
LINE 276: Hastings, a sad fate had overtaken Sir James Clark. His flourishing
LINE 277: practice had quite collapsed; nobody would go to him any more. But the
LINE 278: Queen remained faithful. She would show the world how little she cared
LINE 279: for their disapproval, and she desired Albert to make "poor Clark" his
LINE 280: physician in ordinary. He did as he was told; but, as it turned out, the
LINE 281: appointment was not a happy one.
LINE 282: The wedding-day was fixed, and it was time for Albert to tear himself
LINE 283: away from his family and the scenes of his childhood. With an aching
LINE 284: heart, he had revisited his beloved haunts--the woods and the valleys
LINE 285: where he had spent so many happy hours shooting rabbits and collecting
LINE 286: botanical specimens; in deep depression, he had sat through the farewell
LINE 287: banquets in the Palace and listened to the Freischutz performed by
LINE 288: the State band. It was time to go. The streets were packed as he drove
LINE 289: through them; for a short space his eyes were gladdened by a sea of
LINE 290: friendly German faces, and his ears by a gathering volume of good
LINE 291: guttural sounds. He stopped to bid a last adieu to his grandmother.
LINE 292: It was a heartrending moment. "Albert! Albert!" she shrieked, and fell
LINE 293: fainting into the arms of her attendants as his carriage drove away. He
LINE 294: was whirled rapidly to his destiny. At Calais a steamboat awaited him,
LINE 295: and, together with his father and his brother, he stepped, dejected, on
LINE 296: board. A little later, he was more dejected still. The crossing was a
LINE 297: very rough one; the Duke went hurriedly below; while the two Princes,
LINE 298: we are told, lay on either side of the cabin staircase "in an almost
LINE 299: helpless state." At Dover a large crowd was collected on the pier, and
LINE 300: "it was by no common effort that Prince Albert, who had continued to
LINE 301: suffer up to the last moment, got up to bow to the people." His sense
LINE 302: of duty triumphed. It was a curious omen: his whole life in England was
LINE 303: foreshadowed as he landed on English ground.
LINE 304: Meanwhile Victoria, in growing agitation, was a prey to temper and to
LINE 305: nerves. She grew feverish, and at last Sir James Clark pronounced
LINE 306: that she was going to have the measles. But, once again, Sir James's
LINE 307: diagnosis was incorrect. It was not the measles that were attacking
LINE 308: her, but a very different malady; she was suddenly prostrated by alarm,
LINE 309: regret, and doubt. For two years she had been her own mistress--the two
LINE 310: happiest years, by far, of her life. And now it was all to end! She was
LINE 311: to come under an alien domination--she would have to promise that she
LINE 312: would honour and obey... someone, who might, after all, thwart her,
LINE 313: oppose her--and how dreadful that would be! Why had she embarked on this
LINE 314: hazardous experiment? Why had she not been contented with Lord M.? No
LINE 315: doubt, she loved Albert; but she loved power too. At any rate, one thing
LINE 316: was certain: she might be Albert's wife, but she would always be Queen
LINE 317: of England. He reappeared, in an exquisite uniform, and her hesitations
LINE 318: melted in his presence like mist before the sun. On February 10, 1840,
LINE 319: the marriage took place. The wedded pair drove down to Windsor; but
LINE 320: they were not, of course, entirely alone. They were accompanied by their
LINE 321: suites, and, in particular, by two persons--the Baron Stockmar and the
LINE 322: Baroness Lehzen.
LINE 323: III
LINE 324: Albert had foreseen that his married life would not be all plain
LINE 325: sailing; but he had by no means realised the gravity and the
LINE 326: complication of the difficulties which he would have to face.
LINE 327: Politically, he was a cipher. Lord Melbourne was not only Prime
LINE 328: Minister, he was in effect the Private Secretary of the Queen, and thus
LINE 329: controlled the whole of the political existence of the sovereign. A
LINE 330: queen's husband was an entity unknown to the British Constitution. In
LINE 331: State affairs there seemed to be no place for him; nor was Victoria
LINE 332: herself at all unwilling that this should be so. "The English," she had
LINE 333: told the Prince when, during their engagement, a proposal had been made
LINE 334: to give him a peerage, "are very jealous of any foreigner interfering in
LINE 335: the government of this country, and have already in some of the papers
LINE 336: expressed a hope that you would not interfere. Now, though I know you
LINE 337: never would, still, if you were a Peer, they would all say, the Prince
LINE 338: meant to play a political part. I know you never would!" In reality, she
LINE 339: was not quite so certain; but she wished Albert to understand her views.
LINE 340: He would, she hoped, make a perfect husband; but, as for governing the
LINE 341: country, he would see that she and Lord M. between them could manage
LINE 342: that very well, without his help.
LINE 343: But it was not only in politics that the Prince discovered that the part
LINE 344: cut out for him was a negligible one. Even as a husband, he found, his
LINE 345: functions were to be of an extremely limited kind. Over the whole of
LINE 346: Victoria's private life the Baroness reigned supreme; and she had not
LINE 347: the slightest intention of allowing that supremacy to be diminished by
LINE 348: one iota. Since the accession, her power had greatly increased. Besides
LINE 349: the undefined and enormous influence which she exercised through her
LINE 350: management of the Queen's private correspondence, she was now the
LINE 351: superintendent of the royal establishment and controlled the important
LINE 352: office of Privy Purse. Albert very soon perceived that he was not master
LINE 353: in his own house. Every detail of his own and his wife's existence was
LINE 354: supervised by a third person: nothing could be done until the consent
LINE 355: of Lehzen had first been obtained. And Victoria, who adored Lehzen with
LINE 356: unabated intensity, saw nothing in all this that was wrong.
LINE 357: Nor was the Prince happier in his social surroundings. A shy young
LINE 358: foreigner, awkward in ladies' company, unexpansive and self-opinionated,
LINE 359: it was improbable that, in any circumstances, he would have been a
LINE 360: society success. His appearance, too, was against him. Though in the
LINE 361: eyes of Victoria he was the mirror of manly beauty, her subjects, whose
LINE 362: eyes were of a less Teutonic cast, did not agree with her. To them--and
LINE 363: particularly to the high-born ladies and gentlemen who naturally saw him
LINE 364: most--what was immediately and distressingly striking in Albert's face
LINE 365: and figure and whole demeanour was his un-English look. His features
LINE 366: were regular, no doubt, but there was something smooth and smug about
LINE 367: them; he was tall, but he was clumsily put together, and he walked with
LINE 368: a slight slouch. Really, they thought, this youth was more like
LINE 369: some kind of foreign tenor than anything else. These were serious
LINE 370: disadvantages; but the line of conduct which the Prince adopted from
LINE 371: the first moment of his arrival was far from calculated to dispel
LINE 372: them. Owing partly to a natural awkwardness, partly to a fear of undue
LINE 373: familiarity, and partly to a desire to be absolutely correct, his
LINE 374: manners were infused with an extraordinary stiffness and formality.
LINE 375: Whenever he appeared in company, he seemed to be surrounded by a thick
LINE 376: hedge of prickly etiquette. He never went out into ordinary society; he
LINE 377: never walked in the streets of London; he was invariably accompanied by
LINE 378: an equerry when he rode or drove. He wanted to be irreproachable and, if
LINE 379: that involved friendlessness, it could not be helped. Besides, he had no
LINE 380: very high opinion of the English. So far as he could see, they cared for
LINE 381: nothing but fox-hunting and Sunday observances; they oscillated between
LINE 382: an undue frivolity and an undue gloom; if you spoke to them of friendly
LINE 383: joyousness they stared; and they did not understand either the Laws of
LINE 384: Thought or the wit of a German University. Since it was clear that with
LINE 385: such people he could have very little in common, there was no reason
LINE 386: whatever for relaxing in their favour the rules of etiquette. In strict
LINE 387: privacy, he could be natural and charming; Seymour and Anson were
LINE 388: devoted to him, and he returned their affection; but they were
LINE 389: subordinates--the receivers of his confidences and the agents of his
LINE 390: will. From the support and the solace of true companionship he was
LINE 391: utterly cut off.
LINE 392: A friend, indeed, he had--or rather, a mentor. The Baron, established
LINE 393: once more in the royal residence, was determined to work with as
LINE 394: wholehearted a detachment for the Prince's benefit as, more than twenty
LINE 395: years before, he had worked for his uncle's. The situations then and
LINE 396: now, similar in many respects, were yet full of differences. Perhaps in
LINE 397: either case the difficulties to be encountered were equally great; but
LINE 398: the present problem was the more complex and the more interesting. The
LINE 399: young doctor who, unknown and insignificant, had nothing at the back of
LINE 400: him but his own wits and the friendship of an unimportant Prince, had
LINE 401: been replaced by the accomplished confidant of kings and ministers, ripe
LINE 402: in years, in reputation, and in the wisdom of a vast experience. It
LINE 403: was possible for him to treat Albert with something of the affectionate
LINE 404: authority of a father; but, on the other hand, Albert was no Leopold.
LINE 405: As the Baron was very well aware, he had none of his uncle's rigidity of
LINE 406: ambition, none of his overweening impulse to be personally great. He was
LINE 407: virtuous and well-intentioned; he was clever and well-informed; but he
LINE 408: took no interest in politics, and there were no signs that he possessed
LINE 409: any commanding force of character. Left to himself, he would almost
LINE 410: certainly have subsided into a high-minded nonentity, an aimless
LINE 411: dilettante busy over culture, a palace appendage without influence or
LINE 412: power. But he was not left to himself: Stockmar saw to that. For ever
LINE 413: at his pupil's elbow, the hidden Baron pushed him forward, with tireless
LINE 414: pressure, along the path which had been trod by Leopold so many years
LINE 415: ago. But, this time, the goal at the end of it was something more than
LINE 416: the mediocre royalty that Leopold had reached. The prize which Stockmar,
LINE 417: with all the energy of disinterested devotion, had determined should be
LINE 418: Albert's was a tremendous prize indeed.
LINE 419: The beginning of the undertaking proved to be the most arduous part
LINE 420: of it. Albert was easily dispirited: what was the use of struggling to
LINE 421: perform in a role which bored him and which, it was quite clear, nobody
LINE 422: but the dear good Baron had any desire that he should take up? It was
LINE 423: simpler, and it saved a great deal of trouble, to let things slide.
LINE 424: But Stockmar would not have it. Incessantly, he harped upon two
LINE 425: strings--Albert's sense of duty and his personal pride. Had the Prince
LINE 426: forgotten the noble aims to which his life was to be devoted? And was he
LINE 427: going to allow himself, his wife, his family, his whole existence, to be
LINE 428: governed by Baroness Lehzen? The latter consideration was a potent one.
LINE 429: Albert had never been accustomed to giving way; and now, more than ever
LINE 430: before, it would be humiliating to do so. Not only was he constantly
LINE 431: exasperated by the position of the Baroness in the royal household;
LINE 432: there was another and a still more serious cause of complaint. He was,
LINE 433: he knew very well, his wife's intellectual superior, and yet he found,
LINE 434: to his intense annoyance, that there were parts of her mind over which
LINE 435: he exercised no influence. When, urged on by the Baron, he attempted
LINE 436: to discuss politics with Victoria, she eluded the subject, drifted into
LINE 437: generalities, and then began to talk of something else. She was treating
LINE 438: him as she had once treated their uncle Leopold. When at last he
LINE 439: protested, she replied that her conduct was merely the result of
LINE 440: indolence; that when she was with him she could not bear to bother her
LINE 441: head with anything so dull as politics. The excuse was worse than the
LINE 442: fault: was he the wife and she the husband? It almost seemed so. But the
LINE 443: Baron declared that the root of the mischief was Lehzen: that it was she
LINE 444: who encouraged the Queen to have secrets; who did worse--undermined
LINE 445: the natural ingenuousness of Victoria, and induced her to give,
LINE 446: unconsciously no doubt, false reasons to explain away her conduct.
LINE 447: Minor disagreements made matters worse. The royal couple differed in
LINE 448: their tastes. Albert, brought up in a regime of Spartan simplicity and
LINE 449: early hours, found the great Court functions intolerably wearisome,
LINE 450: and was invariably observed to be nodding on the sofa at half-past ten;
LINE 451: while the Queen's favourite form of enjoyment was to dance through the
LINE 452: night, and then, going out into the portico of the Palace, watch the sun
LINE 453: rise behind St. Paul's and the towers of Westminster. She loved London
LINE 454: and he detested it. It was only in Windsor that he felt he could really
LINE 455: breathe; but Windsor too had its terrors: though during the day there
LINE 456: he could paint and walk and play on the piano, after dinner black tedium
LINE 457: descended like a pall. He would have liked to summon distinguished
LINE 458: scientific and literary men to his presence, and after ascertaining
LINE 459: their views upon various points of art and learning, to set forth his
LINE 460: own; but unfortunately Victoria "had no fancy to encourage such people;"
LINE 461: knowing that she was unequal to taking a part in their conversation,
LINE 462: she insisted that the evening routine should remain unaltered; the
LINE 463: regulation interchange of platitudes with official persons was followed
LINE 464: as usual by the round table and the books of engravings, while the
LINE 465: Prince, with one of his attendants, played game after game of double
LINE 466: chess.
LINE 467: It was only natural that in so peculiar a situation, in which the
LINE 468: elements of power, passion, and pride were so strangely apportioned,
LINE 469: there should have been occasionally something more than mere
LINE 470: irritation--a struggle of angry wills. Victoria, no more than Albert,
LINE 471: was in the habit of playing second fiddle. Her arbitrary temper flashed
LINE 472: out. Her vitality, her obstinacy, her overweening sense of her own
LINE 473: position, might well have beaten down before them his superiorities and
LINE 474: his rights. But she fought at a disadvantage; she was, in very truth, no
LINE 475: longer her own mistress; a profound preoccupation dominated her, seizing
LINE 476: upon her inmost purposes for its own extraordinary ends. She was madly
LINE 477: in love. The details of those curious battles are unknown to us; but
LINE 478: Prince Ernest, who remained in England with his brother for some
LINE 479: months, noted them with a friendly and startled eye. One story, indeed,
LINE 480: survives, ill-authenticated and perhaps mythical, yet summing up, as
LINE 481: such stories often do, the central facts of the case. When, in wrath,
LINE 482: the Prince one day had locked himself into his room, Victoria, no less
LINE 483: furious, knocked on the door to be admitted. "Who is there?" he asked.
LINE 484: "The Queen of England" was the answer. He did not move, and again there
LINE 485: was a hail of knocks. The question and the answer were repeated many
LINE 486: times; but at last there was a pause, and then a gentler knocking. "Who
LINE 487: is there?" came once more the relentless question. But this time the
LINE 488: reply was different. "Your wife, Albert." And the door was immediately
LINE 489: opened.
LINE 490: Very gradually the Prince's position changed. He began to find the study
LINE 491: of politics less uninteresting than he had supposed; he read Blackstone,
LINE 492: and took lessons in English Law; he was occasionally present when the
LINE 493: Queen interviewed her Ministers; and at Lord Melbourne's suggestion he
LINE 494: was shown all the despatches relating to Foreign Affairs. Sometimes
LINE 495: he would commit his views to paper, and read them aloud to the Prime
LINE 496: Minister, who, infinitely kind and courteous, listened with attention,
LINE 497: but seldom made any reply. An important step was taken when, before
LINE 498: the birth of the Princess Royal, the Prince, without any opposition
LINE 499: in Parliament, was appointed Regent in case of the death of the Queen.
LINE 500: Stockmar, owing to whose intervention with the Tories this happy result
LINE 501: had been brought about, now felt himself at liberty to take a holiday
LINE 502: with his family in Coburg; but his solicitude, poured out in innumerable
LINE 503: letters, still watched over his pupil from afar. "Dear Prince," he
LINE 504: wrote, "I am satisfied with the news you have sent me. Mistakes,
LINE 505: misunderstandings, obstructions, which come in vexatious opposition
LINE 506: to one's views, are always to be taken for just what they are--namely,
LINE 507: natural phenomena of life, which represent one of its sides, and
LINE 508: that the shady one. In overcoming them with dignity, your mind has to
LINE 509: exercise, to train, to enlighten itself; and your character to gain
LINE 510: force, endurance, and the necessary hardness." The Prince had done well
LINE 511: so far; but he must continue in the right path; above all, he was "never
LINE 512: to relax." "Never to relax in putting your magnanimity to the proof;
LINE 513: never to relax in logical separation of what is great and essential from
LINE 514: what is trivial and of no moment; never to relax in keeping yourself
LINE 515: up to a high standard--in the determination, daily renewed, to be
LINE 516: consistent, patient, courageous." It was a hard programme perhaps, for a
LINE 517: young man of twenty-one; and yet there was something in it which touched
LINE 518: the very depths of Albert's soul. He sighed, but he listened--listened
LINE 519: as to the voice of a spiritual director inspired with divine truth. "The
LINE 520: stars which are needful to you now," the voice continued, "and perhaps
LINE 521: for some time to come, are Love, Honesty, Truth. All those whose minds
LINE 522: are warped, or who are destitute of true feeling, will BE APT TO MISTAKE
LINE 523: YOU, and to persuade themselves and the world that you are not the man
LINE 524: you are--or, at least, may become... Do you, therefore, be on the alert
LINE 525: be times, with your eyes open in every direction... I wish for my Prince
LINE 526: a great, noble, warm, and true heart, such as shall serve as the richest
LINE 527: and surest basis for the noblest views of human nature, and the firmest
LINE 528: resolve to give them development."
LINE 529: Before long, the decisive moment came. There was a General Election, and
LINE 530: it became certain that the Tories, at last, must come into power. The
LINE 531: Queen disliked them as much as ever; but, with a large majority in the
LINE 532: House of Commons, they would now be in a position to insist upon their
LINE 533: wishes being attended to. Lord Melbourne himself was the first to
LINE 534: realise the importance of carrying out the inevitable transition with as
LINE 535: little friction as possible; and with his consent, the Prince, following
LINE 536: up the rapprochement which had begun over the Regency Act, opened,
LINE 537: through Anson, a negotiation with Sir Robert Peel. In a series of secret
LINE 538: interviews, a complete understanding was reached upon the difficult
LINE 539: and complex question of the Bedchamber. It was agreed that the
LINE 540: constitutional point should not be raised, but that on the formation of
LINE 541: the Tory Government, the principal Whig ladies should retire, and their
LINE 542: places be filled by others appointed by Sir Robert. Thus, in effect,
LINE 543: though not in form, the Crown abandoned the claims of 1839, and they
LINE 544: have never been subsequently put forward. The transaction was a turning
LINE 545: point in the Prince's career. He had conducted an important negotiation
LINE 546: with skill and tact; he had been brought into close and friendly
LINE 547: relations with the new Prime Minister; it was obvious that a great
LINE 548: political future lay before him. Victoria was much impressed and deeply
LINE 549: grateful. "My dearest Angel," she told King Leopold, "is indeed a great
LINE 550: comfort to me. He takes the greatest interest in what goes on, feeling
LINE 551: with and for me, and yet abstaining as he ought from biasing me either
LINE 552: way, though we talk much on the subject, and his judgment is, as you
LINE 553: say, good and mild." She was in need of all the comfort and assistance
LINE 554: he could give her. Lord M. was going, and she could hardly bring herself
LINE 555: to speak to Peel. Yes; she would discuss everything with Albert now!
LINE 556: Stockmar, who had returned to England, watched the departure of Lord
LINE 557: Melbourne with satisfaction. If all went well, the Prince should now
LINE 558: wield a supreme political influence over Victoria. But would all go
LINE 559: well?? An unexpected development put the Baron into a serious fright.
LINE 560: When the dreadful moment finally came, and the Queen, in anguish, bade
LINE 561: adieu to her beloved Minister, it was settled between them that, though
LINE 562: it would be inadvisable to meet very often, they could continue to
LINE 563: correspond. Never were the inconsistencies of Lord Melbourne's character
LINE 564: shown more clearly than in what followed. So long as he was in office,
LINE 565: his attitude towards Peel had been irreproachable; he had done all he
LINE 566: could to facilitate the change of government, he had even, through more
LINE 567: than one channel, transmitted privately to his successful rival advice
LINE 568: as to the best means of winning the Queen's good graces. Yet, no sooner
LINE 569: was he in opposition than his heart failed him. He could not bear the
LINE 570: thought of surrendering altogether the privilege and the pleasure of
LINE 571: giving counsel to Victoria--of being cut off completely from the power
LINE 572: and the intimacy which had been his for so long and in such abundant
LINE 573: measure. Though he had declared that he would be perfectly discreet in
LINE 574: his letters, he could not resist taking advantage of the opening they
LINE 575: afforded. He discussed in detail various public questions, and, in
LINE 576: particular, gave the Queen a great deal of advice in the matter of
LINE 577: appointments. This advice was followed. Lord Melbourne recommended
LINE 578: that Lord Heytesbury, who, he said, was an able man, should be made
LINE 579: Ambassador at Vienna; and a week later the Queen wrote to the Foreign
LINE 580: Secretary urging that Lord Heytesbury, whom she believed to be a very
LINE 581: able man, should be employed "on some important mission." Stockmar
LINE 582: was very much alarmed. He wrote a memorandum, pointing out the
LINE 583: unconstitutional nature of Lord Melbourne's proceedings and the
LINE 584: unpleasant position in which the Queen might find herself if they were
LINE 585: discovered by Peel; and he instructed Anson to take this memorandum to
LINE 586: the ex-Minister. Lord Melbourne, lounging on a sofa, read it through
LINE 587: with compressed lips. "This is quite an apple-pie opinion," he said.
LINE 588: When Anson ventured to expostulate further, suggesting that it was
LINE 589: unseemly in the leader of the Opposition to maintain an intimate
LINE 590: relationship with the Sovereign, the old man lost his temper. "God
LINE 591: eternally damn it!" he exclaimed, leaping up from his sofa, and dashing
LINE 592: about the room. "Flesh and blood cannot stand this!" He continued to
LINE 593: write to the Queen, as before; and two more violent bombardments from
LINE 594: the Baron were needed before he was brought to reason. Then, gradually,
LINE 595: his letters grew less and less frequent, with fewer and fewer references
LINE 596: to public concerns; at last, they were entirely innocuous. The Baron
LINE 597: smiled; Lord M. had accepted the inevitable.
LINE 598: The Whig Ministry resigned in September, 1841; but more than a year
LINE 599: was to elapse before another and an equally momentous change was
LINE 600: effected--the removal of Lehzen. For, in the end, the mysterious
LINE 601: governess was conquered. The steps are unknown by which Victoria was at
LINE 602: last led to accept her withdrawal with composure--perhaps with relief;
LINE 603: but it is clear that Albert's domestic position must have been greatly
LINE 604: strengthened by the appearance of children. The birth of the Princess
LINE 605: Royal had been followed in November, 1841, by that of the Prince of
LINE 606: Wales; and before very long another baby was expected. The Baroness,
LINE 607: with all her affection, could have but a remote share in such family
LINE 608: delights. She lost ground perceptibly. It was noticed as a phenomenon
LINE 609: that, once or twice, when the Court travelled, she was left behind at
LINE 610: Windsor. The Prince was very cautious; at the change of Ministry, Lord
LINE 611: Melbourne had advised him to choose that moment for decisive action;
LINE 612: but he judged it wiser to wait. Time and the pressure of inevitable
LINE 613: circumstances were for him; every day his predominance grew more
LINE 614: assured--and every night. At length he perceived that he need hesitate
LINE 615: no longer--that every wish, every velleity of his had only to be
LINE 616: expressed to be at once Victoria's. He spoke, and Lehzen vanished for
LINE 617: ever. No more would she reign in that royal heart and those royal halls.
LINE 618: No more, watching from a window at Windsor, would she follow her pupil
LINE 619: and her sovereign walking on the terrace among the obsequious multitude,
LINE 620: with the eye of triumphant love. Returning to her native Hanover she
LINE 621: established herself at Buckeburg in a small but comfortable house, the
LINE 622: walls of which were entirely covered by portraits of Her Majesty. The
LINE 623: Baron, in spite of his dyspepsia, smiled again: Albert was supreme.
LINE 624: IV
LINE 625: The early discords had passed away completely--resolved into the
LINE 626: absolute harmony of married life. Victoria, overcome by a new, an
LINE 627: unimagined revelation, had surrendered her whole soul to her husband.
LINE 628: The beauty and the charm which so suddenly had made her his at first
LINE 629: were, she now saw, no more than but the outward manifestation of the
LINE 630: true Albert. There was an inward beauty, an inward glory which, blind
LINE 631: that she was, she had then but dimly apprehended, but of which now she
LINE 632: was aware in every fibre of her being--he was good--he was great! How
LINE 633: could she ever have dreamt of setting up her will against his wisdom,
LINE 634: her ignorance against his knowledge, her fancies against his perfect
LINE 635: taste? Had she really once loved London and late hours and dissipation?
LINE 636: She who now was only happy in the country, she who jumped out of bed
LINE 637: every morning--oh, so early!--with Albert, to take a walk, before
LINE 638: breakfast, with Albert alone! How wonderful it was to be taught by him!
LINE 639: To be told by him which trees were which; and to learn all about the
LINE 640: bees! And then to sit doing cross-stitch while he read aloud to her
LINE 641: Hallam's Constitutional History of England! Or to listen to him playing
LINE 642: on his new organ 'The organ is the first of instruments,' he said; or
LINE 643: to sing to him a song by Mendelssohn, with a great deal of care over
LINE 644: the time and the breathing, and only a very occasional false note! And,
LINE 645: after dinner, to--oh, how good of him! He had given up his double chess!
LINE 646: And so there could be round games at the round table, or everyone could
LINE 647: spend the evening in the most amusing way imaginable--spinning counters
LINE 648: and rings.' When the babies came it was still more wonderful. Pussy was
LINE 649: such a clever little girl ("I am not Pussy! I am the Princess Royal!"
LINE 650: she had angrily exclaimed on one occasion); and Bertie--well, she could
LINE 651: only pray MOST fervently that the little Prince of Wales would grow up
LINE 652: to "resemble his angelic dearest Father in EVERY, EVERY respect, both in
LINE 653: body and mind." Her dear Mamma, too, had been drawn once more into the
LINE 654: family circle, for Albert had brought about a reconciliation, and the
LINE 655: departure of Lehzen had helped to obliterate the past. In Victoria's
LINE 656: eyes, life had become an idyll, and, if the essential elements of an
LINE 657: idyll are happiness, love and simplicity, an idyll it was; though,
LINE 658: indeed, it was of a kind that might have disconcerted Theocritus.
LINE 659: "Albert brought in dearest little Pussy," wrote Her Majesty in her
LINE 660: journal, "in such a smart white merino dress trimmed with blue, which
LINE 661: Mamma had given her, and a pretty cap, and placed her on my bed,
LINE 662: seating himself next to her, and she was very dear and good. And, as my
LINE 663: precious, invaluable Albert sat there, and our little Love between us, I
LINE 664: felt quite moved with happiness and gratitude to God."
LINE 665: The past--the past of only three years since--when she looked back upon
LINE 666: it, seemed a thing so remote and alien that she could explain it to
LINE 667: herself in no other way than as some kind of delusion--an unfortunate
LINE 668: mistake. Turning over an old volume of her diary, she came upon this
LINE 669: sentence--"As for 'the confidence of the Crown,' God knows! No MINISTER,
LINE 670: NO FRIEND, EVER possessed it so entirely as this truly excellent Lord
LINE 671: Melbourne possesses mine!" A pang shot through her--she seized a
LINE 672: pen, and wrote upon the margin--"Reading this again, I cannot forbear
LINE 673: remarking what an artificial sort of happiness MINE was THEN, and what
LINE 674: a blessing it is I have now in my beloved Husband REAL and solid
LINE 675: happiness, which no Politics, no worldly reverses CAN change; it could
LINE 676: not have lasted long as it was then, for after all, kind and excellent
LINE 677: as Lord M. is, and kind as he was to me, it was but in Society that I
LINE 678: had amusement, and I was only living on that superficial resource, which
LINE 679: I THEN FANCIED was happiness! Thank God! for ME and others, this is
LINE 680: changed, and I KNOW WHAT REAL HAPPINESS IS--V. R." How did she know?
LINE 681: What is the distinction between happiness that is real and happiness
LINE 682: that is felt? So a philosopher--Lord M. himself perhaps--might have
LINE 683: inquired. But she was no philosopher, and Lord M. was a phantom, and
LINE 684: Albert was beside her, and that was enough.
LINE 685: Happy, certainly, she was; and she wanted everyone to know it. Her
LINE 686: letters to King Leopold are sprinkled thick with raptures. "Oh! my
LINE 687: dearest uncle, I am sure if you knew HOW happy, how blessed I feel, and
LINE 688: how PROUD I feel in possessing SUCH a perfect being as my husband..."
LINE 689: such ecstasies seemed to gush from her pen unceasingly and almost
LINE 690: of their own accord. When, one day, without thinking, Lady Lyttelton
LINE 691: described someone to her as being "as happy as a queen," and then grew
LINE 692: a little confused, "Don't correct yourself, Lady Lyttelton," said Her
LINE 693: Majesty. "A queen IS a very happy woman."
LINE 694: But this new happiness was no lotus dream. On the contrary, it was
LINE 695: bracing, rather than relaxing. Never before had she felt so acutely the
LINE 696: necessity for doing her duty. She worked more methodically than ever
LINE 697: at the business of State; she watched over her children with untiring
LINE 698: vigilance. She carried on a large correspondence; she was occupied with
LINE 699: her farm--her dairy--a whole multitude of household avocations--from
LINE 700: morning till night. Her active, eager little body hurrying with quick
LINE 701: steps after the long strides of Albert down the corridors and avenues
LINE 702: of Windsor, seemed the very expression of her spirit. Amid all the
LINE 703: softness, the deliciousness of unmixed joy, all the liquescence, the
LINE 704: overflowings of inexhaustible sentiment, her native rigidity remained.
LINE 705: "A vein of iron," said Lady Lyttelton, who, as royal governess, had good
LINE 706: means of observation, "runs through her most extraordinary character."
LINE 707: Sometimes the delightful routine of domestic existence had to be
LINE 708: interrupted. It was necessary to exchange Windsor for Buckingham
LINE 709: Palace, to open Parliament, or to interview official personages, or,
LINE 710: occasionally, to entertain foreign visitors at the Castle. Then the
LINE 711: quiet Court put on a sudden magnificence, and sovereigns from over
LINE 712: the seas--Louis Philippe, or the King of Prussia, or the King of
LINE 713: Saxony--found at Windsor an entertainment that was indeed a royal one.
LINE 714: Few spectacles in Europe, it was agreed, produced an effect so imposing
LINE 715: as the great Waterloo banqueting hall, crowded with guests in sparkling
LINE 716: diamonds and blazing uniforms, the long walls hung with the stately
LINE 717: portraits of heroes, and the tables loaded with the gorgeous gold plate
LINE 718: of the kings of England. But, in that wealth of splendour, the most
LINE 719: imposing spectacle of all was the Queen. The little hausfrau, who had
LINE 720: spent the day before walking out with her children, inspecting her
LINE 721: livestock, practicing shakes at the piano, and filling up her journal
LINE 722: with adoring descriptions of her husband, suddenly shone forth, without
LINE 723: art, without effort, by a spontaneous and natural transition, the very
LINE 724: culmination of Majesty. The Tsar of Russia himself was deeply impressed.
LINE 725: Victoria on her side viewed with secret awe the tremendous Nicholas. "A
LINE 726: great event and a great compliment HIS visit certainly is," she told
LINE 727: her uncle, "and the people HERE are extremely flattered at it. He is
LINE 728: certainly a VERY STRIKING man; still very handsome. His profile is
LINE 729: BEAUTIFUL and his manners MOST dignified and graceful; extremely
LINE 730: civil--quite alarmingly so, as he is so full of attentions and
LINE 731: POLITENESS. But the expression of the EYES is FORMIDABLE and unlike
LINE 732: anything I ever saw before." She and Albert and "the good King of
LINE 733: Saxony," who happened to be there at the same time, and whom, she said,
LINE 734: "we like much--he is so unassuming-" drew together like tame villatic
LINE 735: fowl in the presence of that awful eagle. When he was gone, they
LINE 736: compared notes about his face, his unhappiness, and his despotic power
LINE 737: over millions. Well! She for her part could not help pitying him, and
LINE 738: she thanked God she was Queen of England.
LINE 739: When the time came for returning some of these visits, the royal pair
LINE 740: set forth in their yacht, much to Victoria's satisfaction. "I do love a
LINE 741: ship!" she exclaimed, ran up and down ladders with the greatest agility,
LINE 742: and cracked jokes with the sailors. The Prince was more aloof. They
LINE 743: visited Louis Philippe at the Chateau d'Eu; they visited King Leopold in
LINE 744: Brussels. It happened that a still more remarkable Englishwoman was in
LINE 745: the Belgian capital, but she was not remarked; and Queen Victoria passed
LINE 746: unknowing before the steady gaze of one of the mistresses in M. Heger's
LINE 747: pensionnat. "A little stout, vivacious lady, very plainly dressed--not
LINE 748: much dignity or pretension about her," was Charlotte Bronte's comment
LINE 749: as the royal carriage and six flashed by her, making her wait on the
LINE 750: pavement for a moment, and interrupting the train of her reflections.
LINE 751: Victoria was in high spirits, and even succeeded in instilling a little
LINE 752: cheerfulness into her uncle's sombre Court. King Leopold, indeed, was
LINE 753: perfectly contented. His dearest hopes had been fulfilled; all his
LINE 754: ambitions were satisfied; and for the rest of his life he had only to
LINE 755: enjoy, in undisturbed decorum, his throne, his respectability, the table
LINE 756: of precedence, and the punctual discharge of his irksome duties.
LINE 757: But unfortunately the felicity of those who surrounded him was less
LINE 758: complete. His Court, it was murmured, was as gloomy as a conventicle,
LINE 759: and the most dismal of all the sufferers was his wife. "Pas de
LINE 760: plaisanteries, madame!" he had exclaimed to the unfortunate successor of
LINE 761: the Princess Charlotte, when, in the early days of their marriage, she
LINE 762: had attempted a feeble joke. Did she not understand that the consort
LINE 763: of a constitutional sovereign must not be frivolous? She understood, at
LINE 764: last, only too well; and when the startled walls of the state apartments
LINE 765: re-echoed to the chattering and the laughter of Victoria, the poor lady
LINE 766: found that she had almost forgotten how to smile.
LINE 767: Another year, Germany was visited, and Albert displayed the beauties of
LINE 768: his home. When Victoria crossed the frontier, she was much excited--and
LINE 769: she was astonished as well. "To hear the people speak German," she noted
LINE 770: in her diary, "and to see the German soldiers, etc., seemed to me
LINE 771: so singular." Having recovered from this slight shock, she found the
LINE 772: country charming. She was feted everywhere, crowds of the surrounding
LINE 773: royalties swooped down to welcome her, and the prettiest groups of
LINE 774: peasant children, dressed in their best clothes, presented her with
LINE 775: bunches of flowers. The principality of Coburg, with its romantic
LINE 776: scenery and its well-behaved inhabitants, particularly delighted her;
LINE 777: and when she woke up one morning to find herself in "dear Rosenau, my
LINE 778: Albert's birthplace," it was "like a beautiful dream." On her return
LINE 779: home, she expatiated, in a letter to King Leopold, upon the pleasures
LINE 780: of the trip, dwelling especially upon the intensity of her affection for
LINE 781: Albert's native land. "I have a feeling," she said, "for our dear little
LINE 782: Germany, which I cannot describe. I felt it at Rosenau so much. It is
LINE 783: a something which touches me, and which goes to my heart, and makes me
LINE 784: inclined to cry. I never felt at any other place that sort of pensive
LINE 785: pleasure and peace which I felt there. I fear I almost like it too
LINE 786: much."
LINE 787: V
LINE 788: The husband was not so happy as the wife. In spite of the great
LINE 789: improvement in his situation, in spite of a growing family and the
LINE 790: adoration of Victoria, Albert was still a stranger in a strange land,
LINE 791: and the serenity of spiritual satisfaction was denied him. It was
LINE 792: something, no doubt, to have dominated his immediate environment; but it
LINE 793: was not enough; and, besides, in the very completeness of his success,
LINE 794: there was a bitterness. Victoria idolised him; but it was understanding
LINE 795: that he craved for, not idolatry; and how much did Victoria, filled
LINE 796: to the brim though she was with him, understand him? How much does the
LINE 797: bucket understand the well? He was lonely. He went to his organ and
LINE 798: improvised with learned modulations until the sounds, swelling and
LINE 799: subsiding through elaborate cadences, brought some solace to his heart.
LINE 800: Then, with the elasticity of youth, he hurried off to play with the
LINE 801: babies, or to design a new pigsty, or to read aloud the "Church History
LINE 802: of Scotland" to Victoria, or to pirouette before her on one toe, like a
LINE 803: ballet-dancer, with a fixed smile, to show her how she ought to behave
LINE 804: when she appeared in public places. Thus did he amuse himself; but there
LINE 805: was one distraction in which he did not indulge. He never flirted--no,
LINE 806: not with the prettiest ladies of the Court. When, during their
LINE 807: engagement, the Queen had remarked with pride to Lord Melbourne that
LINE 808: the Prince paid no attention to any other woman, the cynic had answered,
LINE 809: "No, that sort of thing is apt to come later;" upon which she had
LINE 810: scolded him severely, and then hurried off to Stockmar to repeat what
LINE 811: Lord M. had said. But the Baron had reassured her; though in other
LINE 812: cases, he had replied, that might happen, he did not think it would
LINE 813: in Albert's. And the Baron was right. Throughout their married life no
LINE 814: rival female charms ever had cause to give Victoria one moment's pang of
LINE 815: jealousy.
LINE 816: What more and more absorbed him--bringing with it a curious comfort of
LINE 817: its own--was his work. With the advent of Peel, he began to intervene
LINE 818: actively in the affairs of the State. In more ways than one--in the cast
LINE 819: of their intelligence, in their moral earnestness, even in the uneasy
LINE 820: formalism of their manners--the two men resembled each other; there was
LINE 821: a sympathy between them; and thus Peel was ready enough to listen to the
LINE 822: advice of Stockmar, and to urge the Prince forward into public life.
LINE 823: A royal commission was about to be formed to enquire whether advantage
LINE 824: might not be taken of the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament to
LINE 825: encourage the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom; and Peel, with great
LINE 826: perspicacity, asked the Prince to preside over it. The work was of a
LINE 827: kind which precisely suited Albert: his love of art, his love of method,
LINE 828: his love of coming into contact--close yet dignified--with distinguished
LINE 829: men--it satisfied them all; and he threw himself into it con amore.
LINE 830: Some of the members of the commission were somewhat alarmed when, in his
LINE 831: opening speech, he pointed out the necessity of dividing the subjects
LINE 832: to be considered into "categories-" the word, they thought, smacked
LINE 833: dangerously of German metaphysics; but their confidence returned when
LINE 834: they observed His Royal Highness's extraordinary technical acquaintance
LINE 835: with the processes of fresco painting. When the question arose as to
LINE 836: whether the decorations upon the walls of the new buildings should,
LINE 837: or should not, have a moral purpose, the Prince spoke strongly for the
LINE 838: affirmative. Although many, he observed, would give but a passing glance
LINE 839: to the works, the painter was not therefore to forget that others
LINE 840: might view them with more thoughtful eyes. This argument convinced the
LINE 841: commission, and it was decided that the subjects to be depicted should
LINE 842: be of an improving nature. The frescoes were carried out in accordance
LINE 843: with the commission's instructions, but unfortunately before very long
LINE 844: they had become, even to the most thoughtful eyes, totally invisible.
LINE 845: It seems that His Royal Highness's technical acquaintance with the
LINE 846: processes of fresco painting was incomplete!
LINE 847: The next task upon which the Prince embarked was a more arduous one:
LINE 848: he determined to reform the organisation of the royal household. This
LINE 849: reform had been long overdue. For years past the confusion, discomfort,
LINE 850: and extravagance in the royal residences, and in Buckingham Palace
LINE 851: particularly, had been scandalous; no reform had been practicable under
LINE 852: the rule of the Baroness; but her functions had now devolved upon
LINE 853: the Prince, and in 1844, he boldly attacked the problem. Three years
LINE 854: earlier, Stockmar, after careful enquiry, had revealed in an elaborate
LINE 855: memorandum an extraordinary state of affairs. The control of the
LINE 856: household, it appeared, was divided in the strangest manner between a
LINE 857: number of authorities, each independent of the other, each possessed
LINE 858: of vague and fluctuating powers, without responsibility, and without
LINE 859: co-ordination. Of these authorities, the most prominent were the Lord
LINE 860: Steward and the Lord Chamberlain--noblemen of high rank and political
LINE 861: importance, who changed office with every administration, who did not
LINE 862: reside with the Court, and had no effective representatives attached
LINE 863: to it. The distribution of their respective functions was uncertain
LINE 864: and peculiar. In Buckingham Palace, it was believed that the Lord
LINE 865: Chamberlain had charge of the whole of the rooms, with the exception of
LINE 866: the kitchen, sculleries, and pantries, which were claimed by the Lord
LINE 867: Steward. At the same time, the outside of the Palace was under the
LINE 868: control of neither of these functionaries--but of the Office of Woods
LINE 869: and Forests; and thus, while the insides of the windows were cleaned by
LINE 870: the Department of the Lord Chamberlain--or possibly, in certain cases,
LINE 871: of the Lord Steward--the Office of Woods and Forests cleaned their
LINE 872: outsides. Of the servants, the housekeepers, the pages, and the
LINE 873: housemaids were under the authority of the Lord Chamberlain; the clerk
LINE 874: of the kitchen, the cooks, and the porters were under that of the Lord
LINE 875: Steward; but the footmen, the livery-porters, and the under-butlers
LINE 876: took their orders from yet another official--the Master of the Horse.
LINE 877: Naturally, in these circumstances the service was extremely defective
LINE 878: and the lack of discipline among the servants disgraceful. They absented
LINE 879: themselves for as long as they pleased and whenever the fancy took
LINE 880: them; "and if," as the Baron put it, "smoking, drinking, and other
LINE 881: irregularities occur in the dormitories, where footmen, etc., sleep
LINE 882: ten and twelve in each room, no one can help it." As for Her Majesty's
LINE 883: guests, there was nobody to show them to their rooms, and they were
LINE 884: often left, having utterly lost their way in the complicated passages,
LINE 885: to wander helpless by the hour. The strange divisions of authority
LINE 886: extended not only to persons but to things. The Queen observed that
LINE 887: there was never a fire in the dining-room. She enquired why. The answer
LINE 888: was "the Lord Steward lays the fire, and the Lord Chamberlain lights
LINE 889: it;" the underlings of those two great noblemen having failed to come
LINE 890: to an accommodation, there was no help for it--the Queen must eat in the
LINE 891: cold.
LINE 892: A surprising incident opened everyone's eyes to the confusion and
LINE 893: negligence that reigned in the Palace. A fortnight after the birth of
LINE 894: the Princess Royal the nurse heard a suspicious noise in the room next
LINE 895: to the Queen's bedroom. She called to one of the pages, who, looking
LINE 896: under a large sofa, perceived there a crouching figure "with a most
LINE 897: repulsive appearance." It was "the boy Jones." This enigmatical
LINE 898: personage, whose escapades dominated the newspapers for several ensuing
LINE 899: months, and whose motives and character remained to the end ambiguous,
LINE 900: was an undersized lad of 17, the son of a tailor, who had apparently
LINE 901: gained admittance to the Palace by climbing over the garden wall and
LINE 902: walking in through an open window. Two years before he had paid a
LINE 903: similar visit in the guise of a chimney-sweep. He now declared that he
LINE 904: had spent three days in the Palace, hiding under various beds, that he
LINE 905: had "helped himself to soup and other eatables," and that he had "sat
LINE 906: upon the throne, seen the Queen, and heard the Princess Royal squall."
LINE 907: Every detail of the strange affair was eagerly canvassed. The Times
LINE 908: reported that the boy Jones had "from his infancy been fond of reading,"
LINE 909: but that "his countenance is exceedingly sullen." It added: "The sofa
LINE 910: under which the boy Jones was discovered, we understand, is one of
LINE 911: the most costly and magnificent material and workmanship, and ordered
LINE 912: expressly for the accommodation of the royal and illustrious visitors
LINE 913: who call to pay their respects to Her Majesty." The culprit was sent
LINE 914: for three months to the "House of Correction." When he emerged, he
LINE 915: immediately returned to Buckingham Palace. He was discovered, and sent
LINE 916: back to the "House of Correction" for another three months, after which
LINE 917: he was offered L4 a week by a music hall to appear upon the stage.
LINE 918: He refused this offer, and shortly afterwards was found by the police
LINE 919: loitering round Buckingham Palace. The authorities acted vigorously,
LINE 920: and, without any trial or process of law, shipped the boy Jones off to
LINE 921: sea. A year later his ship put into Portsmouth to refit, and he at once
LINE 922: disembarked and walked to London. He was re-arrested before he reached
LINE 923: the Palace, and sent back to his ship, the Warspite. On this occasion it
LINE 924: was noticed that he had "much improved in personal appearance and grown
LINE 925: quite corpulent;" and so the boy Jones passed out of history, though
LINE 926: we catch one last glimpse of him in 1844 falling overboard in the
LINE 927: night between Tunis and Algiers. He was fished up again; but it was
LINE 928: conjectured--as one of the Warspite's officers explained in a letter
LINE 929: to The Times--that his fall had not been accidental, but that he
LINE 930: had deliberately jumped into the Mediterranean in order to "see the
LINE 931: life-buoy light burning." Of a boy with such a record, what else could
LINE 932: be supposed?
LINE 933: But discomfort and alarm were not the only results of the mismanagement
LINE 934: of the household; the waste, extravagance, and peculation that also
LINE 935: flowed from it were immeasurable. There were preposterous perquisites
LINE 936: and malpractices of every kind. It was, for instance, an ancient and
LINE 937: immutable rule that a candle that had once been lighted should never be
LINE 938: lighted again; what happened to the old candles, nobody knew. Again, the
LINE 939: Prince, examining the accounts, was puzzled by a weekly expenditure of
LINE 940: thirty-five shillings on "Red Room Wine." He enquired into the matter,
LINE 941: and after great difficulty discovered that in the time of George III
LINE 942: a room in Windsor Castle with red hangings had once been used as a
LINE 943: guard-room, and that five shillings a day had been allowed to provide
LINE 944: wine for the officers. The guard had long since been moved elsewhere,
LINE 945: but the payment for wine in the Red Room continued, the money being
LINE 946: received by a half-pay officer who held the sinecure position of
LINE 947: under-butler.
LINE 948: After much laborious investigation, and a stiff struggle with the
LINE 949: multitude of vested interests which had been brought into being by long
LINE 950: years of neglect, the Prince succeeded in effecting a complete reform.
LINE 951: The various conflicting authorities were induced to resign their powers
LINE 952: into the hands of a single official, the Master of the Household, who
LINE 953: became responsible for the entire management of the royal palaces. Great
LINE 954: economies were made, and the whole crowd of venerable abuses was swept
LINE 955: away. Among others, the unlucky half-pay officer of the Red Room was,
LINE 956: much to his surprise, given the choice of relinquishing his weekly
LINE 957: emolument or of performing the duties of an under-butler. Even the
LINE 958: irregularities among the footmen, etc., were greatly diminished. There
LINE 959: were outcries and complaints; the Prince was accused of meddling, of
LINE 960: injustice, and of saving candle-ends; but he held on his course, and
LINE 961: before long the admirable administration of the royal household was
LINE 962: recognised as a convincing proof of his perseverance and capacity.
LINE 963: At the same time his activity was increasing enormously in a more
LINE 964: important sphere. He had become the Queen's Private Secretary, her
LINE 965: confidential adviser, her second self. He was now always present at her
LINE 966: interviews with Ministers. He took, like the Queen, a special interest
LINE 967: in foreign policy; but there was no public question in which his
LINE 968: influence was not felt. A double process was at work; while Victoria
LINE 969: fell more and more absolutely under his intellectual predominance, he,
LINE 970: simultaneously, grew more and more completely absorbed by the machinery
LINE 971: of high politics--the incessant and multifarious business of a great
LINE 972: State. Nobody any more could call him a dilettante; he was a worker,
LINE 973: a public personage, a man of affairs. Stockmar noted the change with
LINE 974: exultation. "The Prince," he wrote, "has improved very much lately.
LINE 975: He has evidently a head for politics. He has become, too, far more
LINE 976: independent. His mental activity is constantly on the increase, and he
LINE 977: gives the greater part of his time to business, without complaining."
LINE 978: "The relations between husband and wife," added the Baron, "are all one
LINE 979: could desire."
LINE 980: Long before Peel's ministry came to an end, there had been a complete
LINE 981: change in Victoria's attitude towards him. His appreciation of the
LINE 982: Prince had softened her heart; the sincerity and warmth of his nature,
LINE 983: which, in private intercourse with those whom he wished to please, had
LINE 984: the power of gradually dissipating the awkwardness of his manners,
LINE 985: did the rest. She came in time to regard him with intense feelings of
LINE 986: respect and attachment. She spoke of "our worthy Peel," for whom, she
LINE 987: said, she had "an EXTREME admiration" and who had shown himself "a man
LINE 988: of unbounded LOYALTY, COURAGE patriotism, and HIGH-MINDEDNESS, and his
LINE 989: conduct towards me has been CHIVALROUS almost, I might say." She dreaded
LINE 990: his removal from office almost as frantically as she had once dreaded
LINE 991: that of Lord M. It would be, she declared, a GREAT CALAMITY. Six years
LINE 992: before, what would she have said, if a prophet had told her that the day
LINE 993: would come when she would be horrified by the triumph of the Whigs? Yet
LINE 994: there was no escaping it; she had to face the return of her old
LINE 995: friends. In the ministerial crises of 1845 and 1846, the Prince played a
LINE 996: dominating part. Everybody recognised that he was the real centre of the
LINE 997: negotiations--the actual controller of the forces and the functions
LINE 998: of the Crown. The process by which this result was reached had been so
LINE 999: gradual as to be almost imperceptible; but it may be said with certainty
LINE 1000: that, by the close of Peel's administration, Albert had become, in
LINE 1001: effect, the King of England.
LINE 1002: VI
LINE 1003: With the final emergence of the Prince came the final extinction of Lord
LINE 1004: Melbourne. A year after his loss of office, he had been struck down by
LINE 1005: a paralytic seizure; he had apparently recovered, but his old elasticity
LINE 1006: had gone for ever. Moody, restless, and unhappy, he wandered like a
LINE 1007: ghost about the town, bursting into soliloquies in public places, or
LINE 1008: asking odd questions, suddenly, a propos de bottes. "I'll be hanged if
LINE 1009: I do it for you, my Lord," he was heard to say in the hall at Brooks's,
LINE 1010: standing by himself, and addressing the air after much thought. "Don't
LINE 1011: you consider," he abruptly asked a fellow-guest at Lady Holland's,
LINE 1012: leaning across the dinner-table in a pause of the conversation, "that
LINE 1013: it was a most damnable act of Henri Quatre to change his religion with
LINE 1014: a view to securing the Crown?" He sat at home, brooding for hours in
LINE 1015: miserable solitude. He turned over his books--his classics and his
LINE 1016: Testaments--but they brought him no comfort at all. He longed for the
LINE 1017: return of the past, for the impossible, for he knew not what, for the
LINE 1018: devilries of Caro, for the happy platitudes of Windsor. His friends had
LINE 1019: left him, and no wonder, he said in bitterness--the fire was out. He
LINE 1020: secretly hoped for a return to power, scanning the newspapers with
LINE 1021: solicitude, and occasionally making a speech in the House of Lords. His
LINE 1022: correspondence with the Queen continued, and he appeared from time to
LINE 1023: time at Court; but he was a mere simulacrum of his former self; "the
LINE 1024: dream," wrote Victoria, "is past." As for his political views, they
LINE 1025: could no longer be tolerated. The Prince was an ardent Free Trader, and
LINE 1026: so, of course, was the Queen; and when, dining at Windsor at the time of
LINE 1027: the repeal of the Corn Laws, Lord Melbourne suddenly exclaimed, "Ma'am,
LINE 1028: it's a damned dishonest act!" everyone was extremely embarrassed. Her
LINE 1029: Majesty laughed and tried to change the conversation, but without avail;
LINE 1030: Lord Melbourne returned to the charge again and again with--"I say,
LINE 1031: Ma'am, it's damned dishonest!"--until the Queen said "Lord Melbourne, I
LINE 1032: must beg you not to say anything more on this subject now;" and then
LINE 1033: he held his tongue. She was kind to him, writing him long letters, and
LINE 1034: always remembering his birthday; but it was kindness at a distance, and
LINE 1035: he knew it. He had become "poor Lord Melbourne." A profound disquietude
LINE 1036: devoured him. He tried to fix his mind on the condition of Agriculture
LINE 1037: and the Oxford Movement. He wrote long memoranda in utterly
LINE 1038: undecipherable handwriting. He was convinced that he had lost all his
LINE 1039: money, and could not possibly afford to be a Knight of the Garter. He
LINE 1040: had run through everything, and yet--if Peel went out, he might be sent
LINE 1041: for--why not? He was never sent for. The Whigs ignored him in their
LINE 1042: consultations, and the leadership of the party passed to Lord
LINE 1043: John Russell. When Lord John became Prime Minister, there was much
LINE 1044: politeness, but Lord Melbourne was not asked to join the Cabinet. He
LINE 1045: bore the blow with perfect amenity; but he understood, at last, that
LINE 1046: that was the end.
LINE 1047: For two years more he lingered, sinking slowly into unconsciousness and
LINE 1048: imbecility. Sometimes, propped up in his chair, he would be heard to
LINE 1049: murmur, with unexpected appositeness, the words of Samson:--
LINE 1050: "So much I feel my general spirit droop,
LINE 1051: My hopes all flat, nature within me seems,
LINE 1052: In all her functions weary of herself,
LINE 1053: My race of glory run, and race of shame,
LINE 1054: And I shall shortly be with them that rest."
LINE 1055: A few days before his death, Victoria, learning that there was no hope
LINE 1056: of his recovery, turned her mind for a little towards that which had
LINE 1057: once been Lord M. "You will grieve to hear," she told King Leopold,
LINE 1058: "that our good, dear, old friend Melbourne is dying... One cannot
LINE 1059: forget how good and kind and amiable he was, and it brings back so many
LINE 1060: recollections to my mind, though, God knows! I never wish that time back
LINE 1061: again."
LINE 1062: She was in little danger. The tide of circumstance was flowing now
LINE 1063: with irresistible fullness towards a very different consummation.
LINE 1064: The seriousness of Albert, the claims of her children, her own inmost
LINE 1065: inclinations, and the movement of the whole surrounding world, combined
LINE 1066: to urge her forward along the narrow way of public and domestic duty.
LINE 1067: Her family steadily increased. Within eighteen months of the birth of
LINE 1068: the Prince of Wales the Princess Alice appeared, and a year later the
LINE 1069: Prince Alfred, and then the Princess Helena, and, two years afterwards,
LINE 1070: the Princess Louise; and still there were signs that the pretty row of
LINE 1071: royal infants was not complete. The parents, more and more involved in
LINE 1072: family cares and family happiness, found the pomp of Windsor galling,
LINE 1073: and longed for some more intimate and remote retreat. On the advice of
LINE 1074: Peel they purchased the estate of Osborne, in the Isle of Wight. Their
LINE 1075: skill and economy in financial matters had enabled them to lay aside a
LINE 1076: substantial sum of money; and they could afford, out of their savings,
LINE 1077: not merely to buy the property but to build a new house for themselves
LINE 1078: and to furnish it at a cost of L200,000. At Osborne, by the sea-shore,
LINE 1079: and among the woods, which Albert, with memories of Rosenau in his mind,
LINE 1080: had so carefully planted, the royal family spent every hour that could
LINE 1081: be snatched from Windsor and London--delightful hours of deep retirement
LINE 1082: and peaceful work. The public looked on with approval. A few aristocrats
LINE 1083: might sniff or titter; but with the nation at large the Queen was now
LINE 1084: once more extremely popular. The middle-classes, in particular, were
LINE 1085: pleased. They liked a love-match; they liked a household which combined
LINE 1086: the advantages of royalty and virtue, and in which they seemed to see,
LINE 1087: reflected as in some resplendent looking-glass, the ideal image of the
LINE 1088: very lives they led themselves. Their own existences, less exalted,
LINE 1089: but oh! so soothingly similar, acquired an added excellence, an added
LINE 1090: succulence, from the early hours, the regularity, the plain tuckers, the
LINE 1091: round games, the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding oft Osborne. It was
LINE 1092: indeed a model Court. Not only were its central personages the patterns
LINE 1093: of propriety, but no breath of scandal, no shadow of indecorum, might
LINE 1094: approach its utmost boundaries. For Victoria, with all the zeal of a
LINE 1095: convert, upheld now the standard of moral purity with an inflexibility
LINE 1096: surpassing, if that were possible, Albert's own. She blushed to think
LINE 1097: how she had once believed--how she had once actually told HIM--that one
LINE 1098: might be too strict and particular in such matters, and that one ought
LINE 1099: to be indulgent towards other people's dreadful sins. But she was
LINE 1100: no longer Lord M's pupil: she was Albert's wife. She was more--the
LINE 1101: embodiment, the living apex of a new era in the generations of mankind.
LINE 1102: The last vestige of the eighteenth century had disappeared; cynicism and
LINE 1103: subtlety were shrivelled into powder; and duty, industry, morality, and
LINE 1104: domesticity triumphed over them. Even the very chairs and tables had
LINE 1105: assumed, with a singular responsiveness, the forms of prim solidity. The
LINE 1106: Victorian Age was in full swing.
LINE 1107: VII
LINE 1108: Only one thing more was needed: material expression must be given to
LINE 1109: the new ideals and the new forces so that they might stand revealed, in
LINE 1110: visible glory, before the eyes of an astonished world. It was for Albert
LINE 1111: to supply this want. He mused, and was inspired: the Great Exhibition
LINE 1112: came into his head.
LINE 1113: Without consulting anyone, he thought out the details of his conception
LINE 1114: with the minutest care. There had been exhibitions before in the world,
LINE 1115: but this should surpass them all. It should contain specimens of
LINE 1116: what every country could produce in raw materials, in machinery and
LINE 1117: mechanical inventions, in manufactures, and in the applied and plastic
LINE 1118: arts. It should not be merely useful and ornamental; it should teach
LINE 1119: a high moral lesson. It should be an international monument to those
LINE 1120: supreme blessings of civilisation--peace, progress, and prosperity. For
LINE 1121: some time past the Prince had been devoting much of his attention to the
LINE 1122: problems of commerce and industry. He had a taste for machinery of every
LINE 1123: kind, and his sharp eye had more than once detected, with the precision
LINE 1124: of an expert, a missing cog-wheel in some vast and complicated engine. A
LINE 1125: visit to Liverpool, where he opened the Albert Dock, impressed upon his
LINE 1126: mind the immensity of modern industrial forces, though in a letter
LINE 1127: to Victoria describing his experiences, he was careful to retain his
LINE 1128: customary lightness of touch. "As I write," he playfully remarked,
LINE 1129: "you will be making your evening toilette, and not be ready in time for
LINE 1130: dinner. I must set about the same task, and not, let me hope, with the
LINE 1131: same result... The loyalty and enthusiasm of the inhabitants are great;
LINE 1132: but the heat is greater still. I am satisfied that if the population of
LINE 1133: Liverpool had been weighed this morning, and were to be weighed again
LINE 1134: now, they would be found many degrees lighter. The docks are wonderful,
LINE 1135: and the mass of shipping incredible." In art and science he had been
LINE 1136: deeply interested since boyhood; his reform of the household had put
LINE 1137: his talent for organisation beyond a doubt; and thus from every point
LINE 1138: of view the Prince was well qualified for his task. Having matured his
LINE 1139: plans, he summoned a small committee and laid an outline of his scheme
LINE 1140: before it. The committee approved, and the great undertaking was set on
LINE 1141: foot without delay.
LINE 1142: Two years, however, passed before it was completed. For two years the
LINE 1143: Prince laboured with extraordinary and incessant energy. At first all
LINE 1144: went smoothly. The leading manufacturers warmly took up the idea; the
LINE 1145: colonies and the East India Company were sympathetic; the great foreign
LINE 1146: nations were eager to send in their contributions; the powerful support
LINE 1147: of Sir Robert Peel was obtained, and the use of a site in Hyde Park,
LINE 1148: selected by the Prince, was sanctioned by the Government. Out of 234
LINE 1149: plans for the exhibition building, the Prince chose that of Joseph
LINE 1150: Paxton, famous as a designer of gigantic conservatories; and the work
LINE 1151: was on the point of being put in hand when a series of unexpected
LINE 1152: difficulties arose. Opposition to the whole scheme, which had long been
LINE 1153: smouldering in various quarters, suddenly burst forth. There was
LINE 1154: an outcry, headed by The Times, against the use of the park for the
LINE 1155: exhibition; for a moment it seemed as if the building would be relegated
LINE 1156: to a suburb; but, after a fierce debate in the House, the supporters
LINE 1157: of the site in the Park won the day. Then it appeared that the project
LINE 1158: lacked a sufficient financial backing; but this obstacle, too, was
LINE 1159: surmounted, and eventually L200,000 was subscribed as a guarantee fund.
LINE 1160: The enormous glass edifice rose higher and higher, covering acres and
LINE 1161: enclosing towering elm trees beneath its roof: and then the fury of
LINE 1162: its enemies reached a climax. The fashionable, the cautious, the
LINE 1163: Protectionists, the pious, all joined in the hue and cry. It was pointed
LINE 1164: out that the Exhibition would serve as a rallying point for all the
LINE 1165: ruffians in England, for all the malcontents in Europe; and that on
LINE 1166: the day of its opening there would certainly be a riot and probably a
LINE 1167: revolution. It was asserted that the glass roof was porous, and that the
LINE 1168: droppings of fifty million sparrows would utterly destroy every object
LINE 1169: beneath it. Agitated nonconformists declared that the Exhibition was an
LINE 1170: arrogant and wicked enterprise which would infallibly bring down God's
LINE 1171: punishment upon the nation. Colonel Sibthorpe, in the debate on the
LINE 1172: Address, prayed that hail and lightning might descend from heaven on the
LINE 1173: accursed thing. The Prince, with unyielding perseverance and infinite
LINE 1174: patience, pressed on to his goal. His health was seriously affected; he
LINE 1175: suffered from constant sleeplessness; his strength was almost worn out.
LINE 1176: But he remembered the injunctions of Stockmar and never relaxed. The
LINE 1177: volume of his labours grew more prodigious every day; he toiled at
LINE 1178: committees, presided over public meetings, made speeches, and carried on
LINE 1179: communications with every corner of the civilised world--and his efforts
LINE 1180: were rewarded. On May 1, 1851, the Great Exhibition was opened by the
LINE 1181: Queen before an enormous concourse of persons, amid scenes of dazzling
LINE 1182: brilliancy and triumphant enthusiasm.
LINE 1183: Victoria herself was in a state of excitement which bordered on
LINE 1184: delirium. She performed her duties in a trance of joy, gratitude, and
LINE 1185: amazement, and, when it was all over, her feelings poured themselves out
LINE 1186: into her journal in a torrential flood. The day had been nothing but
LINE 1187: an endless succession of glories--or rather one vast glory--one vast
LINE 1188: radiation of Albert. Everything she had seen, everything she had felt
LINE 1189: or heard, had been so beautiful, so wonderful that even the royal
LINE 1190: underlinings broke down under the burden of emphasis, while her
LINE 1191: remembering pen rushed on, regardless, from splendour to splendour--the
LINE 1192: huge crowds, so well--behaved and loyal-flags of all the nations
LINE 1193: floating--the inside of the building, so immense, with myriads of people
LINE 1194: and the sun shining through the roof--a little side room, where we left
LINE 1195: our shawls--palm-trees and machinery--dear Albert--the place so big
LINE 1196: that we could hardly hear the organ--thankfulness to God--a curious
LINE 1197: assemblage of political and distinguished men--the March from
LINE 1198: Athalie--God bless my dearest Albert, God bless my dearest country!--a
LINE 1199: glass fountain--the Duke and Lord Anglesey walking arm in arm--a
LINE 1200: beautiful Amazon, in bronze, by Kiss--Mr. Paxton, who might be justly
LINE 1201: proud, and rose from being a common gardener's boy--Sir George Grey in
LINE 1202: tears, and everybody astonished and delighted.
LINE 1203: A striking incident occurred when, after a short prayer by the
LINE 1204: Archbishop of Canterbury, the choir of 600 voices burst into the
LINE 1205: "Hallelujah Chorus." At that moment a Chinaman, dressed in full national
LINE 1206: costume, stepped out into the middle of the central nave, and, advancing
LINE 1207: slowly towards the royal group, did obeisance to Her Majesty. The Queen,
LINE 1208: much impressed, had no doubt that he was an eminent mandarin; and,
LINE 1209: when the final procession was formed, orders were given that, as
LINE 1210: no representative of the Celestial Empire was present, he should be
LINE 1211: included in the diplomatic cortege. He accordingly, with the utmost
LINE 1212: gravity, followed immediately behind the Ambassadors. He subsequently
LINE 1213: disappeared, and it was rumoured, among ill-natured people, that, far
LINE 1214: from being a mandarin, the fellow was a mere impostor. But nobody ever
LINE 1215: really discovered the nature of the comments that had been lurking
LINE 1216: behind the matchless impassivity of that yellow face.
LINE 1217: A few days later Victoria poured out her heart to her uncle. The
LINE 1218: first of May, she said, was "the GREATEST day in our history, the most
LINE 1219: BEAUTIFUL and IMPOSING and TOUCHING spectacle ever seen, and the triumph
LINE 1220: of my beloved Albert... It was the HAPPIEST, PROUDEST day in my life,
LINE 1221: and I can think of nothing else. Albert's dearest name is immortalised
LINE 1222: with this GREAT conception, HIS own, and my OWN dear country SHOWED she
LINE 1223: was WORTHY of it. The triumph is IMMENSE."
LINE 1224: It was. The enthusiasm was universal; even the bitterest scoffers were
LINE 1225: converted, and joined in the chorus of praise. Congratulations from
LINE 1226: public bodies poured in; the City of Paris gave a great fete to the
LINE 1227: Exhibition committee; and the Queen and the Prince made a triumphal
LINE 1228: progress through the North of England. The financial results were
LINE 1229: equally remarkable. The total profit made by the Exhibition amounted to
LINE 1230: a sum of L165,000, which was employed in the purchase of land for the
LINE 1231: erection of a permanent National Museum in South Kensington. During
LINE 1232: the six months of its existence in Hyde Park over six million persons
LINE 1233: visited it, and not a single accident occurred. But there is an end to
LINE 1234: all things; and the time had come for the Crystal Palace to be removed
LINE 1235: to the salubrious seclusion of Sydenham. Victoria, sad but resigned,
LINE 1236: paid her final visit. "It looked so beautiful," she said. "I could not
LINE 1237: believe it was the last time I was to see it. An organ, accompanied by
LINE 1238: a fine and powerful wind instrument called the sommerophone, was being
LINE 1239: played, and it nearly upset me. The canvas is very dirty, the red
LINE 1240: curtains are faded and many things are very much soiled, still the
LINE 1241: effect is fresh and new as ever and most beautiful. The glass fountain
LINE 1242: was already removed... and the sappers and miners were rolling about
LINE 1243: the little boxes just as they did at the beginning. It made us all very
LINE 1244: melancholy." But more cheerful thoughts followed. When all was over,
LINE 1245: she expressed her boundless satisfaction in a dithyrambic letter to
LINE 1246: the Prime Minister. Her beloved husband's name, she said, was for ever
LINE 1247: immortalised, and that this was universally recognised by the country
LINE 1248: was a source to her of immense happiness and gratitude. "She feels
LINE 1249: grateful to Providence," Her Majesty concluded, "to have permitted her
LINE 1250: to be united to so great, so noble, so excellent a Prince, and this year
LINE 1251: will ever remain the proudest and happiest of her life. The day of the
LINE 1252: closing of the Exhibition (which the Queen regretted much she could not
LINE 1253: witness), was the twelfth anniversary of her betrothal to the Prince,
LINE 1254: which is a curious coincidence."
