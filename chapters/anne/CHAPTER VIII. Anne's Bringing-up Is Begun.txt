LINE 1: FOR reasons best known to herself, Marilla did not tell Anne that
LINE 2: she was to stay at Green Gables until the next afternoon. During the
LINE 3: forenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her
LINE 4: with a keen eye while she did them. By noon she had concluded that Anne
LINE 5: was smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her most
LINE 6: serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in
LINE 7: the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was
LINE 8: sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.
LINE 9: When Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted
LINE 10: Marilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to
LINE 11: learn the worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her
LINE 12: face flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she
LINE 13: clasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:
LINE 14: "Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won't you tell me if you are going to send
LINE 15: me away or not? I've tried to be patient all the morning, but I really
LINE 16: feel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It's a dreadful feeling.
LINE 17: Please tell me."
LINE 18: "You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to
LINE 19: do," said Marilla immovably. "Just go and do it before you ask any more
LINE 20: questions, Anne."
LINE 21: Anne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla
LINE 22: and fastened imploring eyes of the latter's face. "Well," said Marilla,
LINE 23: unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, "I
LINE 24: suppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep
LINE 25: you--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself
LINE 26: grateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?"
LINE 27: "I'm crying," said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. "I can't think why.
LINE 28: I'm glad as glad can be. Oh, _glad_ doesn't seem the right word at all. I
LINE 29: was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms--but this! Oh, it's
LINE 30: something more than glad. I'm so happy. I'll try to be so good. It
LINE 31: will be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was
LINE 32: desperately wicked. However, I'll do my very best. But can you tell me
LINE 33: why I'm crying?"
LINE 34: "I suppose it's because you're all excited and worked up," said Marilla
LINE 35: disapprovingly. "Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I'm
LINE 36: afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes, you can stay here and
LINE 37: we will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it's only a
LINE 38: fortnight till vacation so it isn't worth while for you to start before
LINE 39: it opens again in September."
LINE 40: "What am I to call you?" asked Anne. "Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert?
LINE 41: Can I call you Aunt Marilla?"
LINE 42: "No; you'll call me just plain Marilla. I'm not used to being called
LINE 43: Miss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous."
LINE 44: "It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla," protested Anne.
LINE 45: "I guess there'll be nothing disrespectful in it if you're careful
LINE 46: to speak respectfully. Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me
LINE 47: Marilla except the minister. He says Miss Cuthbert--when he thinks of
LINE 48: it."
LINE 49: "I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla," said Anne wistfully. "I've never
LINE 50: had an aunt or any relation at all--not even a grandmother. It would
LINE 51: make me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can't I call you Aunt
LINE 52: Marilla?"
LINE 53: "No. I'm not your aunt and I don't believe in calling people names that
LINE 54: don't belong to them."
LINE 55: "But we could imagine you were my aunt."
LINE 56: "I couldn't," said Marilla grimly.
LINE 57: "Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?" asked
LINE 58: Anne wide-eyed.
LINE 59: "No."
LINE 60: "Oh!" Anne drew a long breath. "Oh, Miss--Marilla, how much you miss!"
LINE 61: "I don't believe in imagining things different from what they really
LINE 62: are," retorted Marilla. "When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances
LINE 63: He doesn't mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go
LINE 64: into the sitting room, Anne--be sure your feet are clean and don't
LINE 65: let any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that's on the
LINE 66: mantelpiece. The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare
LINE 67: time this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There's to be no more
LINE 68: of such praying as I heard last night."
LINE 69: "I suppose I was very awkward," said Anne apologetically, "but then, you
LINE 70: see, I'd never had any practice. You couldn't really expect a person
LINE 71: to pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a
LINE 72: splendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.
LINE 73: It was nearly as long as a minister's and so poetical. But would you
LINE 74: believe it? I couldn't remember one word when I woke up this morning.
LINE 75: And I'm afraid I'll never be able to think out another one as good.
LINE 76: Somehow, things never are so good when they're thought out a second
LINE 77: time. Have you ever noticed that?"
LINE 78: "Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do
LINE 79: a thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and
LINE 80: discourse about it. Just you go and do as I bid you."
LINE 81: Anne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed
LINE 82: to return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting
LINE 83: and marched after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing
LINE 84: motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows,
LINE 85: with her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained
LINE 86: through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt
LINE 87: little figure with a half-unearthly radiance.
LINE 88: "Anne, whatever are you thinking of?" demanded Marilla sharply.
LINE 89: Anne came back to earth with a start.
LINE 90: "That," she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo
LINE 91: entitled, "Christ Blessing Little Children"--"and I was just imagining I
LINE 92: was one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing
LINE 93: off by herself in the corner as if she didn't belong to anybody, like
LINE 94: me. She looks lonely and sad, don't you think? I guess she hadn't any
LINE 95: father or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she
LINE 96: just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would
LINE 97: notice her--except Him. I'm sure I know just how she felt. Her heart
LINE 98: must have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I
LINE 99: asked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn't notice her. But
LINE 100: it's likely He did, don't you think? I've been trying to imagine it all
LINE 101: out--her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close
LINE 102: to Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and
LINE 103: oh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her! But I wish the artist
LINE 104: hadn't painted Him so sorrowful looking. All His pictures are like that,
LINE 105: if you've noticed. But I don't believe He could really have looked so
LINE 106: sad or the children would have been afraid of Him."
LINE 107: "Anne," said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech
LINE 108: long before, "you shouldn't talk that way. It's irreverent--positively
LINE 109: irreverent."
LINE 110: Anne's eyes marveled.
LINE 111: "Why, I felt just as reverent as could be. I'm sure I didn't mean to be
LINE 112: irreverent."
LINE 113: "Well I don't suppose you did--but it doesn't sound right to talk so
LINE 114: familiarly about such things. And another thing, Anne, when I send you
LINE 115: after something you're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and
LINE 116: imagining before pictures. Remember that. Take that card and come right
LINE 117: to the kitchen. Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by
LINE 118: heart."
LINE 119: Anne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had
LINE 120: brought in to decorate the dinner-table--Marilla had eyed that
LINE 121: decoration askance, but had said nothing--propped her chin on her hands,
LINE 122: and fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes.
LINE 123: "I like this," she announced at length. "It's beautiful. I've heard it
LINE 124: before--I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it
LINE 125: over once. But I didn't like it then. He had such a cracked voice and
LINE 126: he prayed it so mournfully. I really felt sure he thought praying was a
LINE 127: disagreeable duty. This isn't poetry, but it makes me feel just the same
LINE 128: way poetry does. 'Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name.'
LINE 129: That is just like a line of music. Oh, I'm so glad you thought of making
LINE 130: me learn this, Miss--Marilla."
LINE 131: "Well, learn it and hold your tongue," said Marilla shortly.
LINE 132: Anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft
LINE 133: kiss on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments
LINE 134: longer.
LINE 135: "Marilla," she demanded presently, "do you think that I shall ever have
LINE 136: a bosom friend in Avonlea?"
LINE 137: "A--a what kind of friend?"
LINE 138: "A bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit
LINE 139: to whom I can confide my inmost soul. I've dreamed of meeting her all
LINE 140: my life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest
LINE 141: dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do
LINE 142: you think it's possible?"
LINE 143: "Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she's about your age. She's
LINE 144: a very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when
LINE 145: she comes home. She's visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You'll
LINE 146: have to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a
LINE 147: very particular woman. She won't let Diana play with any little girl who
LINE 148: isn't nice and good."
LINE 149: Anne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with
LINE 150: interest.
LINE 151: "What is Diana like? Her hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad
LINE 152: enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a
LINE 153: bosom friend."
LINE 154: "Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and
LINE 155: rosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being
LINE 156: pretty."
LINE 157: Marilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was
LINE 158: firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a
LINE 159: child who was being brought up.
LINE 160: But Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the
LINE 161: delightful possibilities before it.
LINE 162: "Oh, I'm so glad she's pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and
LINE 163: that's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom
LINE 164: friend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting
LINE 165: room with glass doors. There weren't any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept
LINE 166: her best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to
LINE 167: keep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night
LINE 168: when he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to
LINE 169: pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in
LINE 170: it. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to
LINE 171: talk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.
LINE 172: Katie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend
LINE 173: that the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I
LINE 174: could open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice
LINE 175: lived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas' shelves of preserves and china. And
LINE 176: then Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a
LINE 177: wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have
LINE 178: lived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond
LINE 179: it just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,
LINE 180: too, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye
LINE 181: through the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond's. But
LINE 182: just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green
LINE 183: little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every
LINE 184: word you said, even if you didn't talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it
LINE 185: was a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved
LINE 186: her almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you
LINE 187: know. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,
LINE 188: and oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had
LINE 189: become so attached to her that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom
LINE 190: friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination
LINE 191: there."
LINE 192: "I think it's just as well there wasn't," said Marilla drily. "I
LINE 193: don't approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own
LINE 194: imaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to
LINE 195: put such nonsense out of your head. But don't let Mrs. Barry hear you
LINE 196: talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she'll think you
LINE 197: tell stories."
LINE 198: "Oh, I won't. I couldn't talk of them to everybody--their memories are
LINE 199: too sacred for that. But I thought I'd like to have you know about them.
LINE 200: Oh, look, here's a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom. Just
LINE 201: think what a lovely place to live--in an apple blossom! Fancy going to
LINE 202: sleep in it when the wind was rocking it. If I wasn't a human girl I
LINE 203: think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers."
LINE 204: "Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull," sniffed Marilla. "I think you
LINE 205: are very fickle minded. I told you to learn that prayer and not talk.
LINE 206: But it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you've got anybody
LINE 207: that will listen to you. So go up to your room and learn it."
LINE 208: "Oh, I know it pretty nearly all now--all but just the last line."
LINE 209: "Well, never mind, do as I tell you. Go to your room and finish learning
LINE 210: it well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea."
LINE 211: "Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?" pleaded Anne.
LINE 212: "No; you don't want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should have
LINE 213: left them on the tree in the first place."
LINE 214: "I did feel a little that way, too," said Anne. "I kind of felt I
LINE 215: shouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn't want
LINE 216: to be picked if I were an apple blossom. But the temptation was
LINE 217: _irresistible_. What do you do when you meet with an irresistible
LINE 218: temptation?"
LINE 219: "Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?"
LINE 220: Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the
LINE 221: window.
LINE 222: "There--I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming
LINE 223: upstairs. Now I'm going to imagine things into this room so that they'll
LINE 224: always stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet
LINE 225: with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the
LINE 226: windows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The
LINE 227: furniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound _so_
LINE 228: luxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions,
LINE 229: pink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it.
LINE 230: I can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall.
LINE 231: I am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a
LINE 232: pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight
LINE 233: darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor. My name is the Lady
LINE 234: Cordelia Fitzgerald. No, it isn't--I can't make _that_ seem real."
LINE 235: She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her
LINE 236: pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.
LINE 237: "You're only Anne of Green Gables," she said earnestly, "and I see you,
LINE 238: just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I'm the Lady
LINE 239: Cordelia. But it's a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than
LINE 240: Anne of nowhere in particular, isn't it?"
LINE 241: She bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook
LINE 242: herself to the open window.
LINE 243: "Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon dear birches down
LINE 244: in the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I
LINE 245: wonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall
LINE 246: love her very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice
LINE 247: and Violetta. They would feel so hurt if I did and I'd hate to hurt
LINE 248: anybody's feelings, even a little bookcase girl's or a little echo
LINE 249: girl's. I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every
LINE 250: day."
LINE 251: Anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry
LINE 252: blossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out
LINE 253: on a sea of daydreams.
