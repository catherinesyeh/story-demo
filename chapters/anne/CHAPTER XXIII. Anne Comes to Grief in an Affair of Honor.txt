LINE 1: ANNE had to live through more than two weeks, as it happened. Almost a
LINE 2: month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time
LINE 3: for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as
LINE 4: absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls
LINE 5: in the pantry instead of into the pigs' bucket, and walking clean over
LINE 6: the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative
LINE 7: reverie, not really being worth counting.
LINE 8: A week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party.
LINE 9: "Small and select," Anne assured Marilla. "Just the girls in our class."
LINE 10: They had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea,
LINE 11: when they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all
LINE 12: their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might
LINE 13: present itself. This presently took the form of "daring."
LINE 14: Daring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just
LINE 15: then. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all
LINE 16: the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers
LINE 17: thereof were "dared" to do them would fill a book by themselves.
LINE 18: First of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point
LINE 19: in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis,
LINE 20: albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said
LINE 21: tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she
LINE 22: should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the
LINE 23: aforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her
LINE 24: left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right
LINE 25: foot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out
LINE 26: at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.
LINE 27: Josie's triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,
LINE 28: Anne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which
LINE 29: bounded the garden to the east. Now, to "walk" board fences requires
LINE 30: more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who
LINE 31: has never tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities
LINE 32: that make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly
LINE 33: cultivated, for walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with
LINE 34: an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that
LINE 35: wasn't worth a "dare." Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for
LINE 36: most of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things
LINE 37: themselves in their efforts to walk fences. Josie descended from her
LINE 38: perch, flushed with victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne.
LINE 39: Anne tossed her red braids.
LINE 40: "I don't think it's such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low,
LINE 41: board fence," she said. "I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the
LINE 42: ridgepole of a roof."
LINE 43: "I don't believe it," said Josie flatly. "I don't believe anybody could
LINE 44: walk a ridgepole. _You_ couldn't, anyhow."
LINE 45: "Couldn't I?" cried Anne rashly.
LINE 46: "Then I dare you to do it," said Josie defiantly. "I dare you to climb
LINE 47: up there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry's kitchen roof."
LINE 48: Anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. She
LINE 49: walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen
LINE 50: roof. All the fifth-class girls said, "Oh!" partly in excitement, partly
LINE 51: in dismay.
LINE 52: "Don't you do it, Anne," entreated Diana. "You'll fall off and be
LINE 53: killed. Never mind Josie Pye. It isn't fair to dare anybody to do
LINE 54: anything so dangerous."
LINE 55: "I must do it. My honor is at stake," said Anne solemnly. "I shall walk
LINE 56: that ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt. If I am killed you are
LINE 57: to have my pearl bead ring."
LINE 58: Anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole,
LINE 59: balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to
LINE 60: walk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up
LINE 61: in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your
LINE 62: imagination helped you out much. Nevertheless, she managed to take
LINE 63: several steps before the catastrophe came. Then she swayed, lost her
LINE 64: balance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked
LINE 65: roof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper
LINE 66: beneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous,
LINE 67: terrified shriek.
LINE 68: If Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended
LINE 69: Diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and
LINE 70: there. Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended
LINE 71: down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was
LINE 72: a much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other
LINE 73: girls had rushed frantically around the house--except Ruby Gillis, who
LINE 74: remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found
LINE 75: Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia
LINE 76: creeper.
LINE 77: "Anne, are you killed?" shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees
LINE 78: beside her friend. "Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and
LINE 79: tell me if you're killed."
LINE 80: To the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye,
LINE 81: who, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible
LINE 82: visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne
LINE 83: Shirley's early and tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered
LINE 84: uncertainly:
LINE 85: "No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious."
LINE 86: "Where?" sobbed Carrie Sloane. "Oh, where, Anne?" Before Anne could
LINE 87: answer Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene. At sight of her Anne tried to
LINE 88: scramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of
LINE 89: pain.
LINE 90: "What's the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?" demanded Mrs. Barry.
LINE 91: "My ankle," gasped Anne. "Oh, Diana, please find your father and ask him
LINE 92: to take me home. I know I can never walk there. And I'm sure I couldn't
LINE 93: hop so far on one foot when Jane couldn't even hop around the garden."
LINE 94: Marilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when
LINE 95: she saw Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs.
LINE 96: Barry beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after
LINE 97: him. In his arms he carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his
LINE 98: shoulder.
LINE 99: At that moment Marilla had a revelation. In the sudden stab of fear that
LINE 100: pierced her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her.
LINE 101: She would have admitted that she liked Anne--nay, that she was very fond
LINE 102: of Anne. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne
LINE 103: was dearer to her than anything else on earth.
LINE 104: "Mr. Barry, what has happened to her?" she gasped, more white and shaken
LINE 105: than the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years.
LINE 106: Anne herself answered, lifting her head.
LINE 107: "Don't be very frightened, Marilla. I was walking the ridgepole and I
LINE 108: fell off. I expect I have sprained my ankle. But, Marilla, I might have
LINE 109: broken my neck. Let us look on the bright side of things."
LINE 110: "I might have known you'd go and do something of the sort when I let you
LINE 111: go to that party," said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her very relief.
LINE 112: "Bring her in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her on the sofa. Mercy me, the
LINE 113: child has gone and fainted!"
LINE 114: It was quite true. Overcome by the pain of her injury, Anne had one more
LINE 115: of her wishes granted to her. She had fainted dead away.
LINE 116: Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway
LINE 117: dispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the
LINE 118: injury was more serious than they had supposed. Anne's ankle was broken.
LINE 119: That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced
LINE 120: girl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.
LINE 121: "Aren't you very sorry for me, Marilla?"
LINE 122: "It was your own fault," said Marilla, twitching down the blind and
LINE 123: lighting a lamp.
LINE 124: "And that is just why you should be sorry for me," said Anne, "because
LINE 125: the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I
LINE 126: could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better. But what would
LINE 127: you have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?"
LINE 128: "I'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. Such
LINE 129: absurdity!" said Marilla.
LINE 130: Anne sighed.
LINE 131: "But you have such strength of mind, Marilla. I haven't. I just felt
LINE 132: that I couldn't bear Josie Pye's scorn. She would have crowed over me
LINE 133: all my life. And I think I have been punished so much that you needn't
LINE 134: be very cross with me, Marilla. It's not a bit nice to faint, after all.
LINE 135: And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won't
LINE 136: be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I'll miss the new lady
LINE 137: teacher. She won't be new any more by the time I'm able to go to school.
LINE 138: And Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted
LINE 139: mortal. But I'll try to bear it all bravely if only you won't be cross
LINE 140: with me, Marilla."
LINE 141: "There, there, I'm not cross," said Marilla. "You're an unlucky child,
LINE 142: there's no doubt about that; but as you say, you'll have the suffering
LINE 143: of it. Here now, try and eat some supper."
LINE 144: "Isn't it fortunate I've got such an imagination?" said Anne. "It will
LINE 145: help me through splendidly, I expect. What do people who haven't any
LINE 146: imagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?"
LINE 147: Anne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during
LINE 148: the tedious seven weeks that followed. But she was not solely dependent
LINE 149: on it. She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of
LINE 150: the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her
LINE 151: all the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea.
LINE 152: "Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla," sighed Anne happily,
LINE 153: on the day when she could first limp across the floor. "It isn't very
LINE 154: pleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla. You
LINE 155: find out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came
LINE 156: to see me, and he's really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of
LINE 157: course; but still I like him and I'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his
LINE 158: prayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into
LINE 159: the habit of saying them as if he didn't. He could get over that if he'd
LINE 160: take a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard
LINE 161: I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me
LINE 162: all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem
LINE 163: so strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my
LINE 164: imagination has its limits, for I can't imagine _that_. When I try to
LINE 165: imagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just
LINE 166: as he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it's so easy to imagine
LINE 167: Mrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen
LINE 168: times. Isn't that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister's
LINE 169: wife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to
LINE 170: have visit you, too. She never tells you it's your own fault and she
LINE 171: hopes you'll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told
LINE 172: me that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that
LINE 173: made me feel she might hope I'd be a better girl but didn't really
LINE 174: believe I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as
LINE 175: politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk
LINE 176: a ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden
LINE 177: of remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She's been
LINE 178: over every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad
LINE 179: when I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the
LINE 180: new teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she
LINE 181: has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses
LINE 182: beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else's in
LINE 183: Avonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody
LINE 184: has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it's just glorious to
LINE 185: think of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie
LINE 186: has so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are
LINE 187: preparing a dialogue, called 'A Morning Visit,' for next Friday. And the
LINE 188: Friday afternoons they don't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them
LINE 189: all to the woods for a 'field' day and they study ferns and flowers
LINE 190: and birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and
LINE 191: evening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all
LINE 192: comes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I
LINE 193: believe I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit."
LINE 194: "There's one thing plain to be seen, Anne," said Marilla, "and that is
LINE 195: that your fall off the Barry roof hasn't injured your tongue at all."
