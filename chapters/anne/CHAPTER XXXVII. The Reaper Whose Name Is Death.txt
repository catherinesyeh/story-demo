LINE 1: MATTHEW--Matthew--what is the matter? Matthew, are you sick?"
LINE 2: It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through
LINE 3: the hall, her hands full of white narcissus,--it was long before Anne
LINE 4: could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,--in time to hear
LINE 5: her and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper
LINE 6: in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her
LINE 7: flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as
LINE 8: Marilla. They were both too late; before they could reach him Matthew
LINE 9: had fallen across the threshold.
LINE 10: "He's fainted," gasped Marilla. "Anne, run for Martin--quick, quick!
LINE 11: He's at the barn."
LINE 12: Martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office,
LINE 13: started at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his way to
LINE 14: send Mr. and Mrs. Barry over. Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand,
LINE 15: came too. They found Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore
LINE 16: Matthew to consciousness.
LINE 17: Mrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her
LINE 18: ear over his heart. She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and
LINE 19: the tears came into her eyes.
LINE 20: "Oh, Marilla," she said gravely. "I don't think--we can do anything for
LINE 21: him."
LINE 22: "Mrs. Lynde, you don't think--you can't think Matthew is--is--" Anne
LINE 23: could not say the dreadful word; she turned sick and pallid.
LINE 24: "Child, yes, I'm afraid of it. Look at his face. When you've seen that
LINE 25: look as often as I have you'll know what it means."
LINE 26: Anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great
LINE 27: Presence.
LINE 28: When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and
LINE 29: probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. The
LINE 30: secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held
LINE 31: and which Martin had brought from the office that morning. It contained
LINE 32: an account of the failure of the Abbey Bank.
LINE 33: The news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and
LINE 34: neighbors thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness
LINE 35: for the dead and living. For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert
LINE 36: was a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had
LINE 37: fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned.
LINE 38: When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was
LINE 39: hushed and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin,
LINE 40: his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little
LINE 41: kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. There were
LINE 42: flowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had
LINE 43: planted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which Matthew
LINE 44: had always had a secret, wordless love. Anne had gathered them and
LINE 45: brought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white
LINE 46: face. It was the last thing she could do for him.
LINE 47: The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to
LINE 48: the east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:
LINE 49: "Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?"
LINE 50: "Thank you, Diana." Anne looked earnestly into her friend's face. "I
LINE 51: think you won't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I'm not
LINE 52: afraid. I haven't been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to
LINE 53: be. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can't
LINE 54: realize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can't be dead; and
LINE 55: the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and
LINE 56: I've had this horrible dull ache ever since."
LINE 57: Diana did not quite understand. Marilla's impassioned grief, breaking
LINE 58: all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush,
LINE 59: she could comprehend better than Anne's tearless agony. But she went
LINE 60: away kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.
LINE 61: Anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a
LINE 62: terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had
LINE 63: loved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked
LINE 64: with her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below
LINE 65: with that awful peace on his brow. But no tears came at first, even when
LINE 66: she knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the
LINE 67: stars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of
LINE 68: misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the
LINE 69: day's pain and excitement.
LINE 70: In the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about
LINE 71: her, and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of
LINE 72: sorrow. She could see Matthew's face smiling at her as he had smiled
LINE 73: when they parted at the gate that last evening--she could hear his voice
LINE 74: saying, "My girl--my girl that I'm proud of." Then the tears came and
LINE 75: Anne wept her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.
LINE 76: "There--there--don't cry so, dearie. It can't bring him back.
LINE 77: It--it--isn't right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn't help
LINE 78: it then. He'd always been such a good, kind brother to me--but God knows
LINE 79: best."
LINE 80: "Oh, just let me cry, Marilla," sobbed Anne. "The tears don't hurt me
LINE 81: like that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me and keep your
LINE 82: arm round me--so. I couldn't have Diana stay, she's good and kind and
LINE 83: sweet--but it's not her sorrow--she's outside of it and she couldn't
LINE 84: come close enough to my heart to help me. It's our sorrow--yours and
LINE 85: mine. Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?"
LINE 86: "We've got each other, Anne. I don't know what I'd do if you weren't
LINE 87: here--if you'd never come. Oh, Anne, I know I've been kind of strict and
LINE 88: harsh with you maybe--but you mustn't think I didn't love you as well as
LINE 89: Matthew did, for all that. I want to tell you now when I can. It's never
LINE 90: been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this
LINE 91: it's easier. I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood
LINE 92: and you've been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables."
LINE 93: Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead
LINE 94: threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had
LINE 95: loved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its
LINE 96: usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old
LINE 97: groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before,
LINE 98: although always with the aching sense of "loss in all familiar things."
LINE 99: Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so--that
LINE 100: they _could_ go on in the old way without Matthew. She felt something like
LINE 101: shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs
LINE 102: and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of
LINE 103: gladness when she saw them--that Diana's visits were pleasant to her
LINE 104: and that Diana's merry words and ways moved her to laughter and
LINE 105: smiles--that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and
LINE 106: friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her
LINE 107: heart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices.
LINE 108: "It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in
LINE 109: these things now that he has gone," she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan
LINE 110: one evening when they were together in the manse garden. "I miss him so
LINE 111: much--all the time--and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very
LINE 112: beautiful and interesting to me for all. Today Diana said something
LINE 113: funny and I found myself laughing. I thought when it happened I could
LINE 114: never laugh again. And it somehow seems as if I oughtn't to."
LINE 115: "When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know
LINE 116: that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you," said Mrs.
LINE 117: Allan gently. "He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the
LINE 118: same. I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing
LINE 119: influences that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling.
LINE 120: I think we all experience the same thing. We resent the thought that
LINE 121: anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share
LINE 122: the pleasure with us, and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our
LINE 123: sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us."
LINE 124: "I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew's grave
LINE 125: this afternoon," said Anne dreamily. "I took a slip of the little white
LINE 126: Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew
LINE 127: always liked those roses the best--they were so small and sweet on
LINE 128: their thorny stems. It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his
LINE 129: grave--as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it
LINE 130: there to be near him. I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps
LINE 131: the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many
LINE 132: summers were all there to meet him. I must go home now. Marilla is all
LINE 133: alone and she gets lonely at twilight."
LINE 134: "She will be lonelier still, I fear, when you go away again to college,"
LINE 135: said Mrs. Allan.
LINE 136: Anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green
LINE 137: Gables. Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down
LINE 138: beside her. The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch
LINE 139: shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.
LINE 140: Anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in
LINE 141: her hair. She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial
LINE 142: benediction, above her every time she moved.
LINE 143: "Doctor Spencer was here while you were away," Marilla said. "He says
LINE 144: that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must
LINE 145: go in and have my eyes examined. I suppose I'd better go and have it
LINE 146: over. I'll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind
LINE 147: of glasses to suit my eyes. You won't mind staying here alone while I'm
LINE 148: away, will you? Martin will have to drive me in and there's ironing and
LINE 149: baking to do."
LINE 150: "I shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall
LINE 151: attend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn't fear that I'll
LINE 152: starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment."
LINE 153: Marilla laughed.
LINE 154: "What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were
LINE 155: always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do
LINE 156: you mind the time you dyed your hair?"
LINE 157: "Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it," smiled Anne, touching the heavy
LINE 158: braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. "I laugh a little
LINE 159: now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I
LINE 160: don't laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then. I did suffer
LINE 161: terribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone; and
LINE 162: people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but Josie
LINE 163: Pye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder
LINE 164: than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked
LINE 165: me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I've
LINE 166: almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I've made what I
LINE 167: would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won't
LINE 168: _be_ liked."
LINE 169: "Josie is a Pye," said Marilla sharply, "so she can't help being
LINE 170: disagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in
LINE 171: society, but I must say I don't know what it is any more than I know the
LINE 172: use of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?"
LINE 173: "No, she is going back to Queen's next year. So are Moody Spurgeon and
LINE 174: Charlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got
LINE 175: schools--Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west."
LINE 176: "Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn't he?"
LINE 177: "Yes"--briefly.
LINE 178: "What a nice-looking fellow he is," said Marilla absently. "I saw him in
LINE 179: church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like
LINE 180: his father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to
LINE 181: be real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau."
LINE 182: Anne looked up with swift interest.
LINE 183: "Oh, Marilla--and what happened?--why didn't you--"
LINE 184: "We had a quarrel. I wouldn't forgive him when he asked me to. I meant
LINE 185: to, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him
LINE 186: first. He never came back--the Blythes were all mighty independent. But
LINE 187: I always felt--rather sorry. I've always kind of wished I'd forgiven him
LINE 188: when I had the chance."
LINE 189: "So you've had a bit of romance in your life, too," said Anne softly.
LINE 190: "Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn't think so to look at
LINE 191: me, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.
LINE 192: Everybody has forgot about me and John. I'd forgotten myself. But it all
LINE 193: came back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday."
LINE 194: CHAPTER XXXVIII. The Bend in the road
LINE 195: MARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had
LINE 196: gone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in
LINE 197: the kitchen, sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand.
LINE 198: Something in her dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne's heart. She
LINE 199: had never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.
LINE 200: "Are you very tired, Marilla?"
LINE 201: "Yes--no--I don't know," said Marilla wearily, looking up. "I suppose I
LINE 202: am tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that."
LINE 203: "Did you see the oculist? What did he say?" asked Anne anxiously.
LINE 204: "Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all
LINE 205: reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,
LINE 206: and if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he's given me
LINE 207: he thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.
LINE 208: But if I don't he says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months.
LINE 209: Blind! Anne, just think of it!"
LINE 210: For a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was
LINE 211: silent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said
LINE 212: bravely, but with a catch in her voice:
LINE 213: "Marilla, _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are
LINE 214: careful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure
LINE 215: your headaches it will be a great thing."
LINE 216: "I don't call it much hope," said Marilla bitterly. "What am I to live
LINE 217: for if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well
LINE 218: be blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get
LINE 219: lonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me
LINE 220: a cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything
LINE 221: about this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks
LINE 222: should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it."
LINE 223: When Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then
LINE 224: Anne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the
LINE 225: darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly
LINE 226: things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!
LINE 227: Then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy
LINE 228: with promise. Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before
LINE 229: she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.
LINE 230: She had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a
LINE 231: friend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.
LINE 232: One afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front
LINE 233: yard where she had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by
LINE 234: sight as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been
LINE 235: saying to bring that look to Marilla's face.
LINE 236: "What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?"
LINE 237: Marilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in
LINE 238: her eyes in defiance of the oculist's prohibition and her voice broke as
LINE 239: she said:
LINE 240: "He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it."
LINE 241: "Buy it! Buy Green Gables?" Anne wondered if she had heard aright. "Oh,
LINE 242: Marilla, you don't mean to sell Green Gables!"
LINE 243: "Anne, I don't know what else is to be done. I've thought it all over.
LINE 244: If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after
LINE 245: things and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can't. I may
LINE 246: lose my sight altogether; and anyway I'll not be fit to run things. Oh,
LINE 247: I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home.
LINE 248: But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till
LINE 249: nobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank;
LINE 250: and there's some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises
LINE 251: me to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her I suppose. It won't
LINE 252: bring much--it's small and the buildings are old. But it'll be enough
LINE 253: for me to live on I reckon. I'm thankful you're provided for with that
LINE 254: scholarship, Anne. I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your
LINE 255: vacations, that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow."
LINE 256: Marilla broke down and wept bitterly.
LINE 257: "You mustn't sell Green Gables," said Anne resolutely.
LINE 258: "Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to. But you can see for yourself. I
LINE 259: can't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my
LINE 260: sight would go--I know it would."
LINE 261: "You won't have to stay here alone, Marilla. I'll be with you. I'm not
LINE 262: going to Redmond."
LINE 263: "Not going to Redmond!" Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and
LINE 264: looked at Anne. "Why, what do you mean?"
LINE 265: "Just what I say. I'm not going to take the scholarship. I decided so
LINE 266: the night after you came home from town. You surely don't think I could
LINE 267: leave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you've done for me.
LINE 268: I've been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry
LINE 269: wants to rent the farm for next year. So you won't have any bother over
LINE 270: that. And I'm going to teach. I've applied for the school here--but I
LINE 271: don't expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to
LINE 272: Gilbert Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school--Mr. Blair told me
LINE 273: so last night at the store. Of course that won't be quite as nice or
LINE 274: convenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and
LINE 275: drive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And
LINE 276: even in winter I can come home Fridays. We'll keep a horse for that. Oh,
LINE 277: I have it all planned out, Marilla. And I'll read to you and keep you
LINE 278: cheered up. You sha'n't be dull or lonesome. And we'll be real cozy and
LINE 279: happy here together, you and I."
LINE 280: Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream.
LINE 281: "Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I
LINE 282: can't let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible."
LINE 283: "Nonsense!" Anne laughed merrily. "There is no sacrifice. Nothing could
LINE 284: be worse than giving up Green Gables--nothing could hurt me more. We
LINE 285: must keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I'm _not_
LINE 286: going to Redmond; and I _am_ going to stay here and teach. Don't you worry
LINE 287: about me a bit."
LINE 288: "But your ambitions--and--"
LINE 289: "I'm just as ambitious as ever. Only, I've changed the object of my
LINE 290: ambitions. I'm going to be a good teacher--and I'm going to save your
LINE 291: eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little
LINE 292: college course all by myself. Oh, I've dozens of plans, Marilla. I've
LINE 293: been thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and
LINE 294: I believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen's my
LINE 295: future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought
LINE 296: I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I
LINE 297: don't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the
LINE 298: best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder
LINE 299: how the road beyond it goes--what there is of green glory and
LINE 300: soft, checkered light and shadows--what new landscapes--what new
LINE 301: beauties--what curves and hills and valleys further on."
LINE 302: "I don't feel as if I ought to let you give it up," said Marilla,
LINE 303: referring to the scholarship.
LINE 304: "But you can't prevent me. I'm sixteen and a half, 'obstinate as a
LINE 305: mule,' as Mrs. Lynde once told me," laughed Anne. "Oh, Marilla, don't
LINE 306: you go pitying me. I don't like to be pitied, and there is no need
LINE 307: for it. I'm heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green
LINE 308: Gables. Nobody could love it as you and I do--so we must keep it."
LINE 309: "You blessed girl!" said Marilla, yielding. "I feel as if you'd given me
LINE 310: new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but
LINE 311: I know I can't, so I ain't going to try. I'll make it up to you though,
LINE 312: Anne."
LINE 313: When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up
LINE 314: the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there
LINE 315: was a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not
LINE 316: knowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did
LINE 317: not. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure
LINE 318: to the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening
LINE 319: and found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,
LINE 320: scented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down
LINE 321: and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled
LINE 322: the dewy air.
LINE 323: Mrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the
LINE 324: door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a
LINE 325: long breath of mingled weariness and relief.
LINE 326: "I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day,
LINE 327: and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's
LINE 328: a great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,
LINE 329: Anne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was
LINE 330: real glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be
LINE 331: comfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men
LINE 332: and cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense."
LINE 333: "But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde," said
LINE 334: Anne laughing. "I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green
LINE 335: Gables, and study everything that I would at college."
LINE 336: Mrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.
LINE 337: "Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself."
LINE 338: "Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo
LINE 339: things. As 'Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be 'mejum'. But I'll
LINE 340: have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no
LINE 341: vocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know."
LINE 342: "I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea.
LINE 343: The trustees have decided to give you the school."
LINE 344: "Mrs. Lynde!" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. "Why, I
LINE 345: thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!"
LINE 346: "So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it
LINE 347: he went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,
LINE 348: you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested
LINE 349: that they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of
LINE 350: course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must
LINE 351: say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real
LINE 352: self-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands,
LINE 353: and everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the
LINE 354: trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came
LINE 355: home and told me."
LINE 356: "I don't feel that I ought to take it," murmured Anne. "I mean--I don't
LINE 357: think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me."
LINE 358: "I guess you can't prevent him now. He's signed papers with the White
LINE 359: Sands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to
LINE 360: refuse. Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right,
LINE 361: now that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a
LINE 362: good thing she was, that's what. There's been some Pye or other going to
LINE 363: Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in
LINE 364: life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn't their home.
LINE 365: Bless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry
LINE 366: gable mean?"
LINE 367: "Diana is signaling for me to go over," laughed Anne. "You know we keep
LINE 368: up the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants."
LINE 369: Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry
LINE 370: shadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.
LINE 371: "There's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways."
LINE 372: "There's a good deal more of the woman about her in others," retorted
LINE 373: Marilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.
LINE 374: But crispness was no longer Marilla's distinguishing characteristic. As
LINE 375: Mrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.
LINE 376: "Marilla Cuthbert has got _mellow_. That's what."
LINE 377: Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh
LINE 378: flowers on Matthew's grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered
LINE 379: there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place,
LINE 380: with its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its
LINE 381: whispering grasses growing at will among the graves. When she finally
LINE 382: left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining
LINE 383: Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike
LINE 384: afterlight--"a haunt of ancient peace." There was a freshness in the
LINE 385: air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home
LINE 386: lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay
LINE 387: the sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west
LINE 388: was a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in
LINE 389: still softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled Anne's heart, and
LINE 390: she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.
LINE 391: "Dear old world," she murmured, "you are very lovely, and I am glad to
LINE 392: be alive in you."
LINE 393: Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the
LINE 394: Blythe homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he
LINE 395: recognized Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed
LINE 396: on in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.
LINE 397: "Gilbert," she said, with scarlet cheeks, "I want to thank you for
LINE 398: giving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to
LINE 399: know that I appreciate it."
LINE 400: Gilbert took the offered hand eagerly.
LINE 401: "It wasn't particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be
LINE 402: able to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after
LINE 403: this? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?"
LINE 404: Anne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.
LINE 405: "I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn't know
LINE 406: it. What a stubborn little goose I was. I've been--I may as well make a
LINE 407: complete confession--I've been sorry ever since."
LINE 408: "We are going to be the best of friends," said Gilbert, jubilantly. "We
LINE 409: were born to be good friends, Anne. You've thwarted destiny enough. I
LINE 410: know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your
LINE 411: studies, aren't you? So am I. Come, I'm going to walk home with you."
LINE 412: Marilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.
LINE 413: "Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?"
LINE 414: "Gilbert Blythe," answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. "I met
LINE 415: him on Barry's hill."
LINE 416: "I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd
LINE 417: stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him," said Marilla with a
LINE 418: dry smile.
LINE 419: "We haven't been--we've been good enemies. But we have decided that it
LINE 420: will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we
LINE 421: really there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,
LINE 422: we have five years' lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla."
LINE 423: Anne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.
LINE 424: The wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came
LINE 425: up to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and
LINE 426: Diana's light gleamed through the old gap.
LINE 427: Anne's horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after
LINE 428: coming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be
LINE 429: narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.
LINE 430: The joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship
LINE 431: were to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her
LINE 432: ideal world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!
LINE 433: "'God's in his heaven, all's right with the world,'" whispered Anne
LINE 434: softly.

LINE 664: Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
LINE 665: electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
LINE 666: computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
LINE 667: exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
LINE 668: from people in all walks of life.
LINE 669: Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
LINE 670: assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
LINE 671: goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
LINE 672: remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
LINE 673: Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
LINE 674: and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
LINE 675: generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 676: Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
LINE 677: Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 678: Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

LINE 690: Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
LINE 691: Literary Archive Foundation
LINE 692: Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
LINE 693: public support and donations to carry out its mission of
LINE 694: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
LINE 695: freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
LINE 696: array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
LINE 697: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
LINE 698: status with the IRS.
LINE 699: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
LINE 700: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
LINE 701: States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
LINE 702: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
LINE 703: with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
LINE 704: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
LINE 705: DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
LINE 706: visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 707: While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
LINE 708: have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
LINE 709: against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
LINE 710: approach us with offers to donate.
LINE 711: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
LINE 712: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
LINE 713: outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
LINE 714: Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
LINE 715: methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
LINE 716: ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
LINE 717: donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
LINE 718: Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
LINE 719: Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
LINE 720: Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
LINE 721: freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
LINE 722: distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
LINE 723: volunteer support.
LINE 724: Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
LINE 725: editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
LINE 726: the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
LINE 727: necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
LINE 728: edition.
LINE 729: Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
LINE 730: facility: www.gutenberg.org.
LINE 731: This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
LINE 732: including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
LINE 733: Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
LINE 734: subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
