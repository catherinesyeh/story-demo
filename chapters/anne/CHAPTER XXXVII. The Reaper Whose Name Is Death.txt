LINE 1: MATTHEW--Matthew--what is the matter? Matthew, are you sick?"
LINE 2: It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word. Anne came through
LINE 3: the hall, her hands full of white narcissus,--it was long before Anne
LINE 4: could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,--in time to hear
LINE 5: her and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper
LINE 6: in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray. Anne dropped her
LINE 7: flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as
LINE 8: Marilla. They were both too late; before they could reach him Matthew
LINE 9: had fallen across the threshold.
LINE 10: "He's fainted," gasped Marilla. "Anne, run for Martin--quick, quick!
LINE 11: He's at the barn."
LINE 12: Martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office,
LINE 13: started at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his way to
LINE 14: send Mr. and Mrs. Barry over. Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand,
LINE 15: came too. They found Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore
LINE 16: Matthew to consciousness.
LINE 17: Mrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her
LINE 18: ear over his heart. She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and
LINE 19: the tears came into her eyes.
LINE 20: "Oh, Marilla," she said gravely. "I don't think--we can do anything for
LINE 21: him."
LINE 22: "Mrs. Lynde, you don't think--you can't think Matthew is--is--" Anne
LINE 23: could not say the dreadful word; she turned sick and pallid.
LINE 24: "Child, yes, I'm afraid of it. Look at his face. When you've seen that
LINE 25: look as often as I have you'll know what it means."
LINE 26: Anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great
LINE 27: Presence.
LINE 28: When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and
LINE 29: probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. The
LINE 30: secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held
LINE 31: and which Martin had brought from the office that morning. It contained
LINE 32: an account of the failure of the Abbey Bank.
LINE 33: The news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and
LINE 34: neighbors thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness
LINE 35: for the dead and living. For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert
LINE 36: was a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had
LINE 37: fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned.
LINE 38: When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was
LINE 39: hushed and tranquil. In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin,
LINE 40: his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little
LINE 41: kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. There were
LINE 42: flowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had
LINE 43: planted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which Matthew
LINE 44: had always had a secret, wordless love. Anne had gathered them and
LINE 45: brought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white
LINE 46: face. It was the last thing she could do for him.
LINE 47: The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night. Diana, going to
LINE 48: the east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:
LINE 49: "Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?"
LINE 50: "Thank you, Diana." Anne looked earnestly into her friend's face. "I
LINE 51: think you won't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone. I'm not
LINE 52: afraid. I haven't been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to
LINE 53: be. I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it. I can't
LINE 54: realize it. Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can't be dead; and
LINE 55: the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and
LINE 56: I've had this horrible dull ache ever since."
LINE 57: Diana did not quite understand. Marilla's impassioned grief, breaking
LINE 58: all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush,
LINE 59: she could comprehend better than Anne's tearless agony. But she went
LINE 60: away kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.
LINE 61: Anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude. It seemed to her a
LINE 62: terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had
LINE 63: loved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked
LINE 64: with her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below
LINE 65: with that awful peace on his brow. But no tears came at first, even when
LINE 66: she knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the
LINE 67: stars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of
LINE 68: misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the
LINE 69: day's pain and excitement.
LINE 70: In the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about
LINE 71: her, and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of
LINE 72: sorrow. She could see Matthew's face smiling at her as he had smiled
LINE 73: when they parted at the gate that last evening--she could hear his voice
LINE 74: saying, "My girl--my girl that I'm proud of." Then the tears came and
LINE 75: Anne wept her heart out. Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.
LINE 76: "There--there--don't cry so, dearie. It can't bring him back.
LINE 77: It--it--isn't right to cry so. I knew that today, but I couldn't help
LINE 78: it then. He'd always been such a good, kind brother to me--but God knows
LINE 79: best."
LINE 80: "Oh, just let me cry, Marilla," sobbed Anne. "The tears don't hurt me
LINE 81: like that ache did. Stay here for a little while with me and keep your
LINE 82: arm round me--so. I couldn't have Diana stay, she's good and kind and
LINE 83: sweet--but it's not her sorrow--she's outside of it and she couldn't
LINE 84: come close enough to my heart to help me. It's our sorrow--yours and
LINE 85: mine. Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?"
LINE 86: "We've got each other, Anne. I don't know what I'd do if you weren't
LINE 87: here--if you'd never come. Oh, Anne, I know I've been kind of strict and
LINE 88: harsh with you maybe--but you mustn't think I didn't love you as well as
LINE 89: Matthew did, for all that. I want to tell you now when I can. It's never
LINE 90: been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this
LINE 91: it's easier. I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood
LINE 92: and you've been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables."
LINE 93: Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead
LINE 94: threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had
LINE 95: loved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its
LINE 96: usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old
LINE 97: groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before,
LINE 98: although always with the aching sense of "loss in all familiar things."
LINE 99: Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so--that
LINE 100: they _could_ go on in the old way without Matthew. She felt something like
LINE 101: shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs
LINE 102: and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of
LINE 103: gladness when she saw them--that Diana's visits were pleasant to her
LINE 104: and that Diana's merry words and ways moved her to laughter and
LINE 105: smiles--that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and
LINE 106: friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her
LINE 107: heart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices.
LINE 108: "It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in
LINE 109: these things now that he has gone," she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan
LINE 110: one evening when they were together in the manse garden. "I miss him so
LINE 111: much--all the time--and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very
LINE 112: beautiful and interesting to me for all. Today Diana said something
LINE 113: funny and I found myself laughing. I thought when it happened I could
LINE 114: never laugh again. And it somehow seems as if I oughtn't to."
LINE 115: "When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know
LINE 116: that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you," said Mrs.
LINE 117: Allan gently. "He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the
LINE 118: same. I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing
LINE 119: influences that nature offers us. But I can understand your feeling.
LINE 120: I think we all experience the same thing. We resent the thought that
LINE 121: anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share
LINE 122: the pleasure with us, and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our
LINE 123: sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us."
LINE 124: "I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew's grave
LINE 125: this afternoon," said Anne dreamily. "I took a slip of the little white
LINE 126: Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew
LINE 127: always liked those roses the best--they were so small and sweet on
LINE 128: their thorny stems. It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his
LINE 129: grave--as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it
LINE 130: there to be near him. I hope he has roses like them in heaven. Perhaps
LINE 131: the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many
LINE 132: summers were all there to meet him. I must go home now. Marilla is all
LINE 133: alone and she gets lonely at twilight."
LINE 134: "She will be lonelier still, I fear, when you go away again to college,"
LINE 135: said Mrs. Allan.
LINE 136: Anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green
LINE 137: Gables. Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down
LINE 138: beside her. The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch
LINE 139: shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.
LINE 140: Anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in
LINE 141: her hair. She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial
LINE 142: benediction, above her every time she moved.
LINE 143: "Doctor Spencer was here while you were away," Marilla said. "He says
LINE 144: that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must
LINE 145: go in and have my eyes examined. I suppose I'd better go and have it
LINE 146: over. I'll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind
LINE 147: of glasses to suit my eyes. You won't mind staying here alone while I'm
LINE 148: away, will you? Martin will have to drive me in and there's ironing and
LINE 149: baking to do."
LINE 150: "I shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall
LINE 151: attend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn't fear that I'll
LINE 152: starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment."
LINE 153: Marilla laughed.
LINE 154: "What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were
LINE 155: always getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do
LINE 156: you mind the time you dyed your hair?"
LINE 157: "Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it," smiled Anne, touching the heavy
LINE 158: braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. "I laugh a little
LINE 159: now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I
LINE 160: don't laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then. I did suffer
LINE 161: terribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone; and
LINE 162: people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but Josie
LINE 163: Pye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder
LINE 164: than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked
LINE 165: me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I've
LINE 166: almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I've made what I
LINE 167: would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won't
LINE 168: _be_ liked."
LINE 169: "Josie is a Pye," said Marilla sharply, "so she can't help being
LINE 170: disagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in
LINE 171: society, but I must say I don't know what it is any more than I know the
LINE 172: use of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?"
LINE 173: "No, she is going back to Queen's next year. So are Moody Spurgeon and
LINE 174: Charlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got
LINE 175: schools--Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west."
LINE 176: "Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn't he?"
LINE 177: "Yes"--briefly.
LINE 178: "What a nice-looking fellow he is," said Marilla absently. "I saw him in
LINE 179: church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like
LINE 180: his father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to
LINE 181: be real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau."
LINE 182: Anne looked up with swift interest.
LINE 183: "Oh, Marilla--and what happened?--why didn't you--"
LINE 184: "We had a quarrel. I wouldn't forgive him when he asked me to. I meant
LINE 185: to, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him
LINE 186: first. He never came back--the Blythes were all mighty independent. But
LINE 187: I always felt--rather sorry. I've always kind of wished I'd forgiven him
LINE 188: when I had the chance."
LINE 189: "So you've had a bit of romance in your life, too," said Anne softly.
LINE 190: "Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn't think so to look at
LINE 191: me, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.
LINE 192: Everybody has forgot about me and John. I'd forgotten myself. But it all
LINE 193: came back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday."
