LINE 1: MARILLA, can I go over to see Diana just for a minute?" asked Anne,
LINE 2: running breathlessly down from the east gable one February evening.
LINE 3: "I don't see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for," said
LINE 4: Marilla shortly. "You and Diana walked home from school together and
LINE 5: then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more, your tongues
LINE 6: going the whole blessed time, clickety-clack. So I don't think you're
LINE 7: very badly off to see her again."
LINE 8: "But she wants to see me," pleaded Anne. "She has something very
LINE 9: important to tell me."
LINE 10: "How do you know she has?"
LINE 11: "Because she just signaled to me from her window. We have arranged a
LINE 12: way to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the
LINE 13: window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So
LINE 14: many flashes mean a certain thing. It was my idea, Marilla."
LINE 15: "I'll warrant you it was," said Marilla emphatically. "And the next
LINE 16: thing you'll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling
LINE 17: nonsense."
LINE 18: "Oh, we're very careful, Marilla. And it's so interesting. Two flashes
LINE 19: mean, 'Are you there?' Three mean 'yes' and four 'no.' Five mean, 'Come
LINE 20: over as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.'
LINE 21: Diana has just signaled five flashes, and I'm really suffering to know
LINE 22: what it is."
LINE 23: "Well, you needn't suffer any longer," said Marilla sarcastically. "You
LINE 24: can go, but you're to be back here in just ten minutes, remember that."
LINE 25: Anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time, although
LINE 26: probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the
LINE 27: discussion of Diana's important communication within the limits of ten
LINE 28: minutes. But at least she had made good use of them.
LINE 29: "Oh, Marilla, what do you think? You know tomorrow is Diana's birthday.
LINE 30: Well, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from
LINE 31: school and stay all night with her. And her cousins are coming over from
LINE 32: Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at
LINE 33: the hall tomorrow night. And they are going to take Diana and me to the
LINE 34: concert--if you'll let me go, that is. You will, won't you, Marilla? Oh,
LINE 35: I feel so excited."
LINE 36: "You can calm down then, because you're not going. You're better at home
LINE 37: in your own bed, and as for that club concert, it's all nonsense, and
LINE 38: little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all."
LINE 39: "I'm sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair," pleaded Anne.
LINE 40: "I'm not saying it isn't. But you're not going to begin gadding about
LINE 41: to concerts and staying out all hours of the night. Pretty doings for
LINE 42: children. I'm surprised at Mrs. Barry's letting Diana go."
LINE 43: "But it's such a very special occasion," mourned Anne, on the verge of
LINE 44: tears. "Diana has only one birthday in a year. It isn't as if birthdays
LINE 45: were common things, Marilla. Prissy Andrews is going to recite 'Curfew
LINE 46: Must Not Ring Tonight.' That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, I'm
LINE 47: sure it would do me lots of good to hear it. And the choir are going to
LINE 48: sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.
LINE 49: And oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is;
LINE 50: he's going to give an address. That will be just about the same thing as
LINE 51: a sermon. Please, mayn't I go, Marilla?"
LINE 52: "You heard what I said, Anne, didn't you? Take off your boots now and go
LINE 53: to bed. It's past eight."
LINE 54: "There's just one more thing, Marilla," said Anne, with the air of
LINE 55: producing the last shot in her locker. "Mrs. Barry told Diana that we
LINE 56: might sleep in the spare-room bed. Think of the honor of your little
LINE 57: Anne being put in the spare-room bed."
LINE 58: "It's an honor you'll have to get along without. Go to bed, Anne, and
LINE 59: don't let me hear another word out of you."
LINE 60: When Anne, with tears rolling over her cheeks, had gone sorrowfully
LINE 61: upstairs, Matthew, who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge
LINE 62: during the whole dialogue, opened his eyes and said decidedly:
LINE 63: "Well now, Marilla, I think you ought to let Anne go."
LINE 64: "I don't then," retorted Marilla. "Who's bringing this child up,
LINE 65: Matthew, you or me?"
LINE 66: "Well now, you," admitted Matthew.
LINE 67: "Don't interfere then."
LINE 68: "Well now, I ain't interfering. It ain't interfering to have your own
LINE 69: opinion. And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go."
LINE 70: "You'd think I ought to let Anne go to the moon if she took the notion,
LINE 71: I've no doubt," was Marilla's amiable rejoinder. "I might have let her
LINE 72: spend the night with Diana, if that was all. But I don't approve of this
LINE 73: concert plan. She'd go there and catch cold like as not, and have her
LINE 74: head filled up with nonsense and excitement. It would unsettle her for
LINE 75: a week. I understand that child's disposition and what's good for it
LINE 76: better than you, Matthew."
LINE 77: "I think you ought to let Anne go," repeated Matthew firmly. Argument
LINE 78: was not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.
LINE 79: Marilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence. The
LINE 80: next morning, when Anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry,
LINE 81: Matthew paused on his way out to the barn to say to Marilla again:
LINE 82: "I think you ought to let Anne go, Marilla."
LINE 83: For a moment Marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered. Then she
LINE 84: yielded to the inevitable and said tartly:
LINE 85: "Very well, she can go, since nothing else 'll please you."
LINE 86: Anne flew out of the pantry, dripping dishcloth in hand.
LINE 87: "Oh, Marilla, Marilla, say those blessed words again."
LINE 88: "I guess once is enough to say them. This is Matthew's doings and I
LINE 89: wash my hands of it. If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or
LINE 90: coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night, don't blame me,
LINE 91: blame Matthew. Anne Shirley, you're dripping greasy water all over the
LINE 92: floor. I never saw such a careless child."
LINE 93: "Oh, I know I'm a great trial to you, Marilla," said Anne repentantly.
LINE 94: "I make so many mistakes. But then just think of all the mistakes I
LINE 95: don't make, although I might. I'll get some sand and scrub up the spots
LINE 96: before I go to school. Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on going to
LINE 97: that concert. I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other
LINE 98: girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didn't know
LINE 99: just how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands
LINE 100: me, and it's so nice to be understood, Marilla."
LINE 101: Anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in
LINE 102: school. Gilbert Blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out
LINE 103: of sight in mental arithmetic. Anne's consequent humiliation was
LINE 104: less than it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the
LINE 105: spare-room bed. She and Diana talked so constantly about it all day that
LINE 106: with a stricter teacher than Mr. Phillips dire disgrace must inevitably
LINE 107: have been their portion.
LINE 108: Anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going
LINE 109: to the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. The
LINE 110: Avonlea Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several
LINE 111: smaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission
LINE 112: ten cents, in aid of the library. The Avonlea young people had been
LINE 113: practicing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in
LINE 114: it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part.
LINE 115: Everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go, except Carrie
LINE 116: Sloane, whose father shared Marilla's opinions about small girls going
LINE 117: out to night concerts. Carrie Sloane cried into her grammar all the
LINE 118: afternoon and felt that life was not worth living.
LINE 119: For Anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and
LINE 120: increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive
LINE 121: ecstasy in the concert itself. They had a "perfectly elegant tea;" and
LINE 122: then came the delicious occupation of dressing in Diana's little room
LINE 123: upstairs. Diana did Anne's front hair in the new pompadour style and
LINE 124: Anne tied Diana's bows with the especial knack she possessed; and they
LINE 125: experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging
LINE 126: their back hair. At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes
LINE 127: glowing with excitement.
LINE 128: True, Anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain
LINE 129: black tam and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with
LINE 130: Diana's jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket. But she remembered in
LINE 131: time that she had an imagination and could use it.
LINE 132: Then Diana's cousins, the Murrays from Newbridge, came; they all crowded
LINE 133: into the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes. Anne reveled in
LINE 134: the drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with
LINE 135: the snow crisping under the runners. There was a magnificent sunset, and
LINE 136: the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to
LINE 137: rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with
LINE 138: wine and fire. Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed
LINE 139: like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.
LINE 140: "Oh, Diana," breathed Anne, squeezing Diana's mittened hand under the
LINE 141: fur robe, "isn't it all like a beautiful dream? Do I really look the
LINE 142: same as usual? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in
LINE 143: my looks."
LINE 144: "You look awfully nice," said Diana, who having just received a
LINE 145: compliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.
LINE 146: "You've got the loveliest color."
LINE 147: The program that night was a series of "thrills" for at least one
LINE 148: listener in the audience, and, as Anne assured Diana, every succeeding
LINE 149: thrill was thrillier than the last. When Prissy Andrews, attired in
LINE 150: a new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white
LINE 151: throat and real carnations in her hair--rumor whispered that the master
LINE 152: had sent all the way to town for them for her--"climbed the slimy
LINE 153: ladder, dark without one ray of light," Anne shivered in luxurious
LINE 154: sympathy; when the choir sang "Far Above the Gentle Daisies" Anne gazed
LINE 155: at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels; when Sam Sloane
LINE 156: proceeded to explain and illustrate "How Sockery Set a Hen" Anne laughed
LINE 157: until people sitting near her laughed too, more out of sympathy with her
LINE 158: than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in
LINE 159: Avonlea; and when Mr. Phillips gave Mark Antony's oration over the
LINE 160: dead body of Cæsar in the most heart-stirring tones--looking at Prissy
LINE 161: Andrews at the end of every sentence--Anne felt that she could rise and
LINE 162: mutiny on the spot if but one Roman citizen led the way.
LINE 163: Only one number on the program failed to interest her. When Gilbert
LINE 164: Blythe recited "Bingen on the Rhine" Anne picked up Rhoda Murray's
LINE 165: library book and read it until he had finished, when she sat rigidly
LINE 166: stiff and motionless while Diana clapped her hands until they tingled.
LINE 167: It was eleven when they got home, sated with dissipation, but with the
LINE 168: exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come. Everybody
LINE 169: seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent. Anne and Diana tiptoed
LINE 170: into the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened.
LINE 171: It was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the
LINE 172: grate.
LINE 173: "Let's undress here," said Diana. "It's so nice and warm."
LINE 174: "Hasn't it been a delightful time?" sighed Anne rapturously. "It must
LINE 175: be splendid to get up and recite there. Do you suppose we will ever be
LINE 176: asked to do it, Diana?"
LINE 177: "Yes, of course, someday. They're always wanting the big scholars to
LINE 178: recite. Gilbert Blythe does often and he's only two years older than us.
LINE 179: Oh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him? When he came to
LINE 180: the line,
LINE 181: 'There's Another, _not_ a sister,'
LINE 182: he looked right down at you."
LINE 183: "Diana," said Anne with dignity, "you are my bosom friend, but I cannot
LINE 184: allow even you to speak to me of that person. Are you ready for bed?
LINE 185: Let's run a race and see who'll get to the bed first."
LINE 186: The suggestion appealed to Diana. The two little white-clad figures flew
LINE 187: down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed
LINE 188: at the same moment. And then--something--moved beneath them, there was a
LINE 189: gasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents:
LINE 190: "Merciful goodness!"
LINE 191: Anne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed
LINE 192: and out of the room. They only knew that after one frantic rush they
LINE 193: found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.
LINE 194: "Oh, who was it--_what_ was it?" whispered Anne, her teeth chattering with
LINE 195: cold and fright.
LINE 196: "It was Aunt Josephine," said Diana, gasping with laughter. "Oh, Anne,
LINE 197: it was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there. Oh, and I know she
LINE 198: will be furious. It's dreadful--it's really dreadful--but did you ever
LINE 199: know anything so funny, Anne?"
LINE 200: "Who is your Aunt Josephine?"
LINE 201: "She's father's aunt and she lives in Charlottetown. She's awfully
LINE 202: old--seventy anyhow--and I don't believe she was _ever_ a little girl. We
LINE 203: were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. She's awfully prim
LINE 204: and proper and she'll scold dreadfully about this, I know. Well, we'll
LINE 205: have to sleep with Minnie May--and you can't think how she kicks."
LINE 206: Miss Josephine Barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next
LINE 207: morning. Mrs. Barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.
LINE 208: "Did you have a good time last night? I tried to stay awake until you
LINE 209: came home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you
LINE 210: would have to go upstairs after all, but I was so tired I fell asleep. I
LINE 211: hope you didn't disturb your aunt, Diana."
LINE 212: Diana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive
LINE 213: smiles of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after
LINE 214: breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which
LINE 215: presently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when
LINE 216: she went down to Mrs. Lynde's on an errand for Marilla.
LINE 217: "So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last
LINE 218: night?" said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye. "Mrs.
LINE 219: Barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody. She's feeling
LINE 220: real worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she
LINE 221: got up this morning--and Josephine Barry's temper is no joke, I can tell
LINE 222: you that. She wouldn't speak to Diana at all."
LINE 223: "It wasn't Diana's fault," said Anne contritely. "It was mine. I
LINE 224: suggested racing to see who would get into bed first."
LINE 225: "I knew it!" said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser.
LINE 226: "I knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it's made a nice lot of
LINE 227: trouble, that's what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but
LINE 228: she declares she won't stay another day and is going right back to town
LINE 229: tomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She'd have gone today if they could
LINE 230: have taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter's music lessons
LINE 231: for Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a
LINE 232: tomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The
LINE 233: Barrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they'd like to keep
LINE 234: on the good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn't say just that to
LINE 235: me, but I'm a pretty good judge of human nature, that's what."
LINE 236: "I'm such an unlucky girl," mourned Anne. "I'm always getting into
LINE 237: scrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I'd shed my heart's
LINE 238: blood for--into them too. Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?"
LINE 239: "It's because you're too heedless and impulsive, child, that's what. You
LINE 240: never stop to think--whatever comes into your head to say or do you say
LINE 241: or do it without a moment's reflection."
LINE 242: "Oh, but that's the best of it," protested Anne. "Something just flashes
LINE 243: into your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it. If you stop to
LINE 244: think it over you spoil it all. Haven't you never felt that yourself,
LINE 245: Mrs. Lynde?"
LINE 246: No, Mrs. Lynde had not. She shook her head sagely.
LINE 247: "You must learn to think a little, Anne, that's what. The proverb you
LINE 248: need to go by is 'Look before you leap'--especially into spare-room
LINE 249: beds."
LINE 250: Mrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but Anne remained
LINE 251: pensive. She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her
LINE 252: eyes appeared very serious. When she left Mrs. Lynde's she took her way
LINE 253: across the crusted fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her at the kitchen
LINE 254: door.
LINE 255: "Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn't she?" whispered
LINE 256: Anne.
LINE 257: "Yes," answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance
LINE 258: over her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. "She was fairly
LINE 259: dancing with rage, Anne. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the
LINE 260: worst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed
LINE 261: of the way they had brought me up. She says she won't stay and I'm sure
LINE 262: I don't care. But Father and Mother do."
LINE 263: "Why didn't you tell them it was my fault?" demanded Anne.
LINE 264: "It's likely I'd do such a thing, isn't it?" said Diana with just scorn.
LINE 265: "I'm no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame
LINE 266: as you."
LINE 267: "Well, I'm going in to tell her myself," said Anne resolutely.
LINE 268: Diana stared.
LINE 269: "Anne Shirley, you'd never! why--she'll eat you alive!"
LINE 270: "Don't frighten me any more than I am frightened," implored Anne. "I'd
LINE 271: rather walk up to a cannon's mouth. But I've got to do it, Diana. It
LINE 272: was my fault and I've got to confess. I've had practice in confessing,
LINE 273: fortunately."
LINE 274: "Well, she's in the room," said Diana. "You can go in if you want to. I
LINE 275: wouldn't dare. And I don't believe you'll do a bit of good."
LINE 276: With this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to
LINE 277: say, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly.
LINE 278: A sharp "Come in" followed.
LINE 279: Miss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by
LINE 280: the fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her
LINE 281: gold-rimmed glasses. She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see
LINE 282: Diana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up
LINE 283: with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.
LINE 284: "Who are you?" demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.
LINE 285: "I'm Anne of Green Gables," said the small visitor tremulously, clasping
LINE 286: her hands with her characteristic gesture, "and I've come to confess, if
LINE 287: you please."
LINE 288: "Confess what?"
LINE 289: "That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I
LINE 290: suggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.
LINE 291: Diana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it
LINE 292: is to blame her."
LINE 293: "Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at
LINE 294: least. Such carryings on in a respectable house!"
LINE 295: "But we were only in fun," persisted Anne. "I think you ought to forgive
LINE 296: us, Miss Barry, now that we've apologized. And anyhow, please forgive
LINE 297: Diana and let her have her music lessons. Diana's heart is set on her
LINE 298: music lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your
LINE 299: heart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be
LINE 300: cross with me. I've been so used in my early days to having people cross
LINE 301: at me that I can endure it much better than Diana can."
LINE 302: Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time
LINE 303: and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said
LINE 304: severely:
LINE 305: "I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.
LINE 306: Little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You
LINE 307: don't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long
LINE 308: and arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you."
LINE 309: "I don't _know_, but I can _imagine_," said Anne eagerly. "I'm sure it must
LINE 310: have been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have
LINE 311: you any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in
LINE 312: our place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly
LINE 313: scared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we
LINE 314: couldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are
LINE 315: used to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel
LINE 316: like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor."
LINE 317: All the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a
LINE 318: sound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen
LINE 319: outside, to give a great gasp of relief.
LINE 320: "I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it's so long since I used
LINE 321: it," she said. "I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as
LINE 322: mine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me
LINE 323: about yourself."
LINE 324: "I am very sorry I can't," said Anne firmly. "I would like to, because
LINE 325: you seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred
LINE 326: spirit although you don't look very much like it. But it is my duty to
LINE 327: go home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind
LINE 328: lady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but
LINE 329: it is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on
LINE 330: the bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive
LINE 331: Diana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea."
LINE 332: "I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me
LINE 333: occasionally," said Miss Barry.
LINE 334: That evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the
LINE 335: senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.
LINE 336: "I've made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better
LINE 337: acquainted with that Anne-girl," she said frankly. "She amuses me, and
LINE 338: at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity."
LINE 339: Marilla's only comment when she heard the story was, "I told you so."
LINE 340: This was for Matthew's benefit.
LINE 341: Miss Barry stayed her month out and over. She was a more agreeable guest
LINE 342: than usual, for Anne kept her in good humor. They became firm friends.
LINE 343: When Miss Barry went away she said:
LINE 344: "Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you're to visit me and
LINE 345: I'll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep."
LINE 346: "Miss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all," Anne confided to Marilla.
LINE 347: "You wouldn't think so to look at her, but she is. You don't find it
LINE 348: right out at first, as in Matthew's case, but after a while you come
LINE 349: to see it. Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's
LINE 350: splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world."
