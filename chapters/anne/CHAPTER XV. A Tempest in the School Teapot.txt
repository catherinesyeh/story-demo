LINE 1: WHAT a splendid day!" said Anne, drawing a long breath. "Isn't it good
LINE 2: just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren't born
LINE 3: yet for missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can
LINE 4: never have this one. And it's splendider still to have such a lovely way
LINE 5: to go to school by, isn't it?"
LINE 6: "It's a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty
LINE 7: and hot," said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and
LINE 8: mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts
LINE 9: reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl
LINE 10: would have.
LINE 11: The little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and
LINE 12: to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with
LINE 13: one's best chum would have forever and ever branded as "awful mean" the
LINE 14: girl who did it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls
LINE 15: you just got enough to tantalize you.
LINE 16: The way Anne and Diana went to school _was_ a pretty one. Anne thought
LINE 17: those walks to and from school with Diana couldn't be improved upon
LINE 18: even by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so
LINE 19: unromantic; but to go by Lover's Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and
LINE 20: the Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.
LINE 21: Lover's Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched
LINE 22: far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by
LINE 23: which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home
LINE 24: in winter. Anne had named it Lover's Lane before she had been a month at
LINE 25: Green Gables.
LINE 26: "Not that lovers ever really walk there," she explained to Marilla,
LINE 27: "but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there's a
LINE 28: Lover's Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it's a very pretty
LINE 29: name, don't you think? So romantic! We can't imagine the lovers into it,
LINE 30: you know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without
LINE 31: people calling you crazy."
LINE 32: Anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover's Lane as far
LINE 33: as the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on
LINE 34: up the lane under the leafy arch of maples--"maples are such sociable
LINE 35: trees," said Anne; "they're always rustling and whispering to
LINE 36: you"--until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane
LINE 37: and walked through Mr. Barry's back field and past Willowmere. Beyond
LINE 38: Willowmere came Violet Vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr.
LINE 39: Andrew Bell's big woods. "Of course there are no violets there now,"
LINE 40: Anne told Marilla, "but Diana says there are millions of them in spring.
LINE 41: Oh, Marilla, can't you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away
LINE 42: my breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat
LINE 43: of me for hitting on fancy names for places. It's nice to be clever at
LINE 44: something, isn't it? But Diana named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so
LINE 45: I let her; but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than
LINE 46: plain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch
LINE 47: Path is one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla."
LINE 48: It was. Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it.
LINE 49: It was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill
LINE 50: straight through Mr. Bell's woods, where the light came down sifted
LINE 51: through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart
LINE 52: of a diamond. It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches,
LINE 53: white stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild
LINE 54: lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly
LINE 55: along it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and
LINE 56: music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees
LINE 57: overhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road
LINE 58: if you were quiet--which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in
LINE 59: a blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and
LINE 60: then it was just up the spruce hill to the school.
LINE 61: The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and
LINE 62: wide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial
LINE 63: old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their
LINE 64: lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school
LINE 65: children. The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was
LINE 66: a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of
LINE 67: milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.
LINE 68: Marilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September
LINE 69: with many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she
LINE 70: get on with the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage
LINE 71: to hold her tongue during school hours?
LINE 72: Things went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that
LINE 73: evening in high spirits.
LINE 74: "I think I'm going to like school here," she announced. "I don't think
LINE 75: much of the master, though. He's all the time curling his mustache
LINE 76: and making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you know. She's
LINE 77: sixteen and she's studying for the entrance examination into Queen's
LINE 78: Academy at Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the master is
LINE 79: _dead gone_ on her. She's got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair
LINE 80: and she does it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at the back
LINE 81: and he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he
LINE 82: says. But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate
LINE 83: and when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and
LINE 84: Ruby Gillis says she doesn't believe it had anything to do with the
LINE 85: lesson."
LINE 86: "Anne Shirley, don't let me hear you talking about your teacher in that
LINE 87: way again," said Marilla sharply. "You don't go to school to criticize
LINE 88: the master. I guess he can teach _you_ something, and it's your business
LINE 89: to learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to
LINE 90: come home telling tales about him. That is something I won't encourage.
LINE 91: I hope you were a good girl."
LINE 92: "Indeed I was," said Anne comfortably. "It wasn't so hard as you might
LINE 93: imagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the window and
LINE 94: we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice
LINE 95: girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It's
LINE 96: so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like
LINE 97: Diana best and always will. I _adore_ Diana. I'm dreadfully far behind the
LINE 98: others. They're all in the fifth book and I'm only in the fourth. I feel
LINE 99: that it's kind of a disgrace. But there's not one of them has such an
LINE 100: imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and
LINE 101: geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my
LINE 102: spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could
LINE 103: see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have
LINE 104: been politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and
LINE 105: Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with 'May I see you home?' on
LINE 106: it. I'm to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear
LINE 107: her bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads
LINE 108: off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh,
LINE 109: Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she
LINE 110: heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose.
LINE 111: Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you
LINE 112: can't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really
LINE 113: a pretty nose? I know you'll tell me the truth."
LINE 114: "Your nose is well enough," said Marilla shortly. Secretly she thought
LINE 115: Anne's nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of
LINE 116: telling her so.
LINE 117: That was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this
LINE 118: crisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the
LINE 119: Birch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.
LINE 120: "I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today," said Diana. "He's been
LINE 121: visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came
LINE 122: home Saturday night. He's _aw'fly_ handsome, Anne. And he teases the
LINE 123: girls something terrible. He just torments our lives out."
LINE 124: Diana's voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented
LINE 125: out than not.
LINE 126: "Gilbert Blythe?" said Anne. "Isn't his name that's written up on the
LINE 127: porch wall with Julia Bell's and a big 'Take Notice' over them?"
LINE 128: "Yes," said Diana, tossing her head, "but I'm sure he doesn't like Julia
LINE 129: Bell so very much. I've heard him say he studied the multiplication
LINE 130: table by her freckles."
LINE 131: "Oh, don't speak about freckles to me," implored Anne. "It isn't
LINE 132: delicate when I've got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices
LINE 133: up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should
LINE 134: just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy's. Not, of
LINE 135: course," she hastened to add, "that anybody would."
LINE 136: Anne sighed. She didn't want her name written up. But it was a little
LINE 137: humiliating to know that there was no danger of it.
LINE 138: "Nonsense," said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played
LINE 139: such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured
LINE 140: on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. "It's only meant as
LINE 141: a joke. And don't you be too sure your name won't ever be written up.
LINE 142: Charlie Sloane is _dead gone_ on you. He told his mother--his _mother_,
LINE 143: mind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That's better than
LINE 144: being good looking."
LINE 145: "No, it isn't," said Anne, feminine to the core. "I'd rather be pretty
LINE 146: than clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can't bear a boy with goggle
LINE 147: eyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I'd never _get_ over it, Diana
LINE 148: Barry. But it _is_ nice to keep head of your class."
LINE 149: "You'll have Gilbert in your class after this," said Diana, "and he's
LINE 150: used to being head of his class, I can tell you. He's only in the fourth
LINE 151: book although he's nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick
LINE 152: and had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him.
LINE 153: They were there three years and Gil didn't go to school hardly any
LINE 154: until they came back. You won't find it so easy to keep head after this,
LINE 155: Anne."
LINE 156: "I'm glad," said Anne quickly. "I couldn't really feel proud of keeping
LINE 157: head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday
LINE 158: spelling 'ebullition.' Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped
LINE 159: in her book. Mr. Phillips didn't see her--he was looking at Prissy
LINE 160: Andrews--but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she
LINE 161: got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all."
LINE 162: "Those Pye girls are cheats all round," said Diana indignantly, as they
LINE 163: climbed the fence of the main road. "Gertie Pye actually went and put
LINE 164: her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I
LINE 165: don't speak to her now."
LINE 166: When Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews's
LINE 167: Latin, Diana whispered to Anne, "That's Gilbert Blythe sitting right
LINE 168: across the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you don't
LINE 169: think he's handsome."
LINE 170: Anne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said
LINE 171: Gilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid
LINE 172: of Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He
LINE 173: was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth
LINE 174: twisted into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take
LINE 175: a sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,
LINE 176: believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at
LINE 177: her and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert
LINE 178: had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the
LINE 179: soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at
LINE 180: Anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.
LINE 181: "I think your Gilbert Blythe _is_ handsome," confided Anne to Diana,
LINE 182: "but I think he's very bold. It isn't good manners to wink at a strange
LINE 183: girl."
LINE 184: But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.
LINE 185: Mr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to
LINE 186: Prissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as
LINE 187: they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their
LINE 188: slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.
LINE 189: Gilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing
LINE 190: utterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only
LINE 191: to the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in
LINE 192: Avonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes
LINE 193: fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west
LINE 194: window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and
LINE 195: seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.
LINE 196: Gilbert Blythe wasn't used to putting himself out to make a girl look
LINE 197: at him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired
LINE 198: Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren't
LINE 199: like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.
LINE 200: Gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne's long red
LINE 201: braid, held it out at arm's length and said in a piercing whisper:
LINE 202: "Carrots! Carrots!"
LINE 203: Then Anne looked at him with a vengeance!
LINE 204: She did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies
LINE 205: fallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert
LINE 206: from eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry
LINE 207: tears.
LINE 208: "You mean, hateful boy!" she exclaimed passionately. "How dare you!"
LINE 209: And then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert's head and
LINE 210: cracked it--slate not head--clear across.
LINE 211: Avonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable
LINE 212: one. Everybody said "Oh" in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby
LINE 213: Gillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy
LINE 214: Sloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared
LINE 215: open-mouthed at the tableau.
LINE 216: Mr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne's
LINE 217: shoulder.
LINE 218: "Anne Shirley, what does this mean?" he said angrily. Anne returned no
LINE 219: answer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell
LINE 220: before the whole school that she had been called "carrots." Gilbert it
LINE 221: was who spoke up stoutly.
LINE 222: "It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her."
LINE 223: Mr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.
LINE 224: "I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such
LINE 225: a vindictive spirit," he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of
LINE 226: being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts
LINE 227: of small imperfect mortals. "Anne, go and stand on the platform in front
LINE 228: of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon."
LINE 229: Anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under
LINE 230: which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,
LINE 231: set face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the
LINE 232: blackboard above her head.
LINE 233: "Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control
LINE 234: her temper," and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,
LINE 235: who couldn't read writing, should understand it.
LINE 236: Anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.
LINE 237: She did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart
LINE 238: for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With
LINE 239: resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana's
LINE 240: sympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's
LINE 241: malicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.
LINE 242: She would _never_ look at him again! She would never speak to him!!
LINE 243: When school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high.
LINE 244: Gilbert Blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.
LINE 245: "I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne," he whispered
LINE 246: contritely. "Honest I am. Don't be mad for keeps, now."
LINE 247: Anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. "Oh
LINE 248: how could you, Anne?" breathed Diana as they went down the road half
LINE 249: reproachfully, half admiringly. Diana felt that _she_ could never have
LINE 250: resisted Gilbert's plea.
LINE 251: "I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe," said Anne firmly. "And Mr.
LINE 252: Phillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my
LINE 253: soul, Diana."
LINE 254: Diana hadn't the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was
LINE 255: something terrible.
LINE 256: "You mustn't mind Gilbert making fun of your hair," she said soothingly.
LINE 257: "Why, he makes fun of all the girls. He laughs at mine because it's
LINE 258: so black. He's called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him
LINE 259: apologize for anything before, either."
LINE 260: "There's a great deal of difference between being called a crow and
LINE 261: being called carrots," said Anne with dignity. "Gilbert Blythe has hurt
LINE 262: my feelings _excruciatingly_, Diana."
LINE 263: It is possible the matter might have blown over without more
LINE 264: excruciation if nothing else had happened. But when things begin to
LINE 265: happen they are apt to keep on.
LINE 266: Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell's spruce
LINE 267: grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they
LINE 268: could keep an eye on Eben Wright's house, where the master boarded. When
LINE 269: they saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse;
LINE 270: but the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright's lane
LINE 271: they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three
LINE 272: minutes too late.
LINE 273: On the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic
LINE 274: fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should
LINE 275: expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone
LINE 276: who came in late would be punished.
LINE 277: All the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell's spruce grove as
LINE 278: usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to "pick a chew." But
LINE 279: spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they
LINE 280: picked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that
LINE 281: recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting
LINE 282: from the top of a patriarchal old spruce "Master's coming."
LINE 283: The girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the
LINE 284: schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to
LINE 285: wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not
LINE 286: been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the
LINE 287: grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a
LINE 288: wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity
LINE 289: of the shadowy places, was latest of all. Anne could run like a deer,
LINE 290: however; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys
LINE 291: at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr.
LINE 292: Phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.
LINE 293: Mr. Phillips's brief reforming energy was over; he didn't want the
LINE 294: bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something
LINE 295: to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it
LINE 296: in Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a
LINE 297: forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a
LINE 298: particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.
LINE 299: "Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys' company we
LINE 300: shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon," he said sarcastically.
LINE 301: "Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe."
LINE 302: The other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the
LINE 303: wreath from Anne's hair and squeezed her hand. Anne stared at the master
LINE 304: as if turned to stone.
LINE 305: "Did you hear what I said, Anne?" queried Mr. Phillips sternly.
LINE 306: "Yes, sir," said Anne slowly "but I didn't suppose you really meant it."
LINE 307: "I assure you I did"--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the
LINE 308: children, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. "Obey me at
LINE 309: once."
LINE 310: For a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing
LINE 311: that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the
LINE 312: aisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms
LINE 313: on the desk. Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down,
LINE 314: told the others going home from school that she'd "acksually never seen
LINE 315: anything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it."
LINE 316: To Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be
LINE 317: singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it
LINE 318: was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should
LINE 319: be Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly
LINE 320: unbearable. Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of
LINE 321: no use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and
LINE 322: humiliation.
LINE 323: At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.
LINE 324: But as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if
LINE 325: his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned
LINE 326: to their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the
LINE 327: history class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and
LINE 328: Mr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses "To Priscilla" before he
LINE 329: called the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never
LINE 330: missed her. Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk
LINE 331: a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, "You are sweet," and
LINE 332: slipped it under the curve of Anne's arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the
LINE 333: pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the
LINE 334: floor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position
LINE 335: without deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert.
LINE 336: When school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out
LINE 337: everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and
LINE 338: arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.
LINE 339: "What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?" Diana wanted to
LINE 340: know, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the
LINE 341: question before.
LINE 342: "I am not coming back to school any more," said Anne. Diana gasped and
LINE 343: stared at Anne to see if she meant it.
LINE 344: "Will Marilla let you stay home?" she asked.
LINE 345: "She'll have to," said Anne. "I'll _never_ go to school to that man
LINE 346: again."
LINE 347: "Oh, Anne!" Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. "I do think you're
LINE 348: mean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid
LINE 349: Gertie Pye--I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do come back,
LINE 350: Anne."
LINE 351: "I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana," said Anne sadly.
LINE 352: "I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But
LINE 353: I can't do this, so please don't ask it. You harrow up my very soul."
LINE 354: "Just think of all the fun you will miss," mourned Diana. "We are going
LINE 355: to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we'll be playing
LINE 356: ball next week and you've never played ball, Anne. It's tremendously
LINE 357: exciting. And we're going to learn a new song--Jane Andrews is
LINE 358: practicing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy
LINE 359: book next week and we're all going to read it out loud, chapter about,
LINE 360: down by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud,
LINE 361: Anne."
LINE 362: Nothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go
LINE 363: to school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.
LINE 364: "Nonsense," said Marilla.
LINE 365: "It isn't nonsense at all," said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn,
LINE 366: reproachful eyes. "Don't you understand, Marilla? I've been insulted."
LINE 367: "Insulted fiddlesticks! You'll go to school tomorrow as usual."
LINE 368: "Oh, no." Anne shook her head gently. "I'm not going back, Marilla. I'll
LINE 369: learn my lessons at home and I'll be as good as I can be and hold my
LINE 370: tongue all the time if it's possible at all. But I will not go back to
LINE 371: school, I assure you."
LINE 372: Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking
LINE 373: out of Anne's small face. She understood that she would have trouble in
LINE 374: overcoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then.
LINE 375: "I'll run down and see Rachel about it this evening," she thought.
LINE 376: "There's no use reasoning with Anne now. She's too worked up and I've
LINE 377: an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can
LINE 378: make out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a
LINE 379: rather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I'll just talk
LINE 380: it over with Rachel. She's sent ten children to school and she ought to
LINE 381: know something about it. She'll have heard the whole story, too, by this
LINE 382: time."
LINE 383: Marilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully
LINE 384: as usual.
LINE 385: "I suppose you know what I've come about," she said, a little
LINE 386: shamefacedly.
LINE 387: Mrs. Rachel nodded.
LINE 388: "About Anne's fuss in school, I reckon," she said. "Tillie Boulter was
LINE 389: in on her way home from school and told me about it."
LINE 390: "I don't know what to do with her," said Marilla. "She declares she
LINE 391: won't go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I've been
LINE 392: expecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were
LINE 393: going too smooth to last. She's so high strung. What would you advise,
LINE 394: Rachel?"
LINE 395: "Well, since you've asked my advice, Marilla," said Mrs. Lynde
LINE 396: amiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--"I'd just
LINE 397: humor her a little at first, that's what I'd do. It's my belief that
LINE 398: Mr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the
LINE 399: children, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday
LINE 400: for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who
LINE 401: were late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I
LINE 402: don't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It
LINE 403: isn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne's part
LINE 404: right through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular
LINE 405: among them, somehow. I never thought she'd take with them so well."
LINE 406: "Then you really think I'd better let her stay home," said Marilla in
LINE 407: amazement.
LINE 408: "Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it
LINE 409: herself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she'll cool off in a week or so and
LINE 410: be ready enough to go back of her own accord, that's what, while, if
LINE 411: you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum
LINE 412: she'd take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the
LINE 413: better, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as
LINE 414: far as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The
LINE 415: order he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young
LINE 416: fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he's getting ready for
LINE 417: Queen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle
LINE 418: hadn't been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two
LINE 419: around by the nose, that's what. I declare, I don't know what education
LINE 420: in this Island is coming to."
LINE 421: Mrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the
LINE 422: head of the educational system of the Province things would be much
LINE 423: better managed.
LINE 424: Marilla took Mrs. Rachel's advice and not another word was said to Anne
LINE 425: about going back to school. She learned her lessons at home, did her
LINE 426: chores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights;
LINE 427: but when she met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday
LINE 428: school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by
LINE 429: his evident desire to appease her. Even Diana's efforts as a peacemaker
LINE 430: were of no avail. Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert
LINE 431: Blythe to the end of life.
LINE 432: As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the
LINE 433: love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and
LINE 434: dislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket
LINE 435: of apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight,
LINE 436: crying bitterly.
LINE 437: "Whatever's the matter now, Anne?" she asked.
LINE 438: "It's about Diana," sobbed Anne luxuriously. "I love Diana so, Marilla.
LINE 439: I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up
LINE 440: that Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall
LINE 441: I do? I hate her husband--I just hate him furiously. I've been imagining
LINE 442: it all out--the wedding and everything--Diana dressed in snowy garments,
LINE 443: with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the
LINE 444: bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a
LINE 445: breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana
LINE 446: goodbye-e-e--" Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing
LINE 447: bitterness.
LINE 448: Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no
LINE 449: use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and
LINE 450: unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted
LINE 451: in amazement. When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?
LINE 452: "Well, Anne Shirley," said Marilla as soon as she could speak, "if you
LINE 453: must borrow trouble, for pity's sake borrow it handier home. I should
LINE 454: think you had an imagination, sure enough."
