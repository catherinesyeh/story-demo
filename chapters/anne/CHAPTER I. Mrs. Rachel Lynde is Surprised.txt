LINE 1: MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down
LINE 2: into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and
LINE 3: traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the
LINE 4: old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook
LINE 5: in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool
LINE 6: and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet,
LINE 7: well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.
LINE 8: Rachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it
LINE 9: probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,
LINE 10: keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children
LINE 11: up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never
LINE 12: rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.
LINE 13: There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend
LINE 14: closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own;
LINE 15: but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage
LINE 16: their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a
LINE 17: notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she "ran" the
LINE 18: Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop
LINE 19: of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all
LINE 20: this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen
LINE 21: window, knitting "cotton warp" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,
LINE 22: as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping
LINE 23: a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up
LINE 24: the steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular
LINE 25: peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two
LINE 26: sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that
LINE 27: hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing
LINE 28: eye.
LINE 29: She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in
LINE 30: at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house
LINE 31: was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of
LINE 32: bees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called "Rachel
LINE 33: Lynde's husband"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field
LINE 34: beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on
LINE 35: the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew
LINE 36: that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening
LINE 37: before in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow
LINE 38: his turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for
LINE 39: Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about
LINE 40: anything in his whole life.
LINE 41: And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon
LINE 42: of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;
LINE 43: moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was
LINE 44: plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy
LINE 45: and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable
LINE 46: distance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going
LINE 47: there?
LINE 48: Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this
LINE 49: and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both
LINE 50: questions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be
LINE 51: something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest
LINE 52: man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where
LINE 53: he might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and
LINE 54: driving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel,
LINE 55: ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon's
LINE 56: enjoyment was spoiled.
LINE 57: "I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla
LINE 58: where he's gone and why," the worthy woman finally concluded. "He
LINE 59: doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if
LINE 60: he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to
LINE 61: go for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.
LINE 62: Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I'm
LINE 63: clean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or
LINE 64: conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea
LINE 65: today."
LINE 66: Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the
LINE 67: big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a
LINE 68: scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the
LINE 69: long lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert's father, as
LINE 70: shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly
LINE 71: could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods
LINE 72: when he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest
LINE 73: edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible
LINE 74: from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so
LINE 75: sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place
LINE 76: _living_ at all.
LINE 77: "It's just _staying_, that's what," she said as she stepped along the
LINE 78: deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. "It's no wonder
LINE 79: Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by
LINE 80: themselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were
LINE 81: there'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they
LINE 82: seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body
LINE 83: can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said."
LINE 84: With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green
LINE 85: Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one
LINE 86: side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.
LINE 87: Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have
LINE 88: seen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla
LINE 89: Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could
LINE 90: have eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial
LINE 91: peck of dirt.
LINE 92: Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in
LINE 93: when bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful
LINE 94: apartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully
LINE 95: clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its
LINE 96: windows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on
LINE 97: the back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,
LINE 98: whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left
LINE 99: orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,
LINE 100: was greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when
LINE 101: she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to
LINE 102: her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to
LINE 103: be taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind
LINE 104: her was laid for supper.
LINE 105: Mrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental
LINE 106: note of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,
LINE 107: so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but
LINE 108: the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves
LINE 109: and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any
LINE 110: particular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel
LINE 111: mare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery
LINE 112: about quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.
LINE 113: "Good evening, Rachel," Marilla said briskly. "This is a real fine
LINE 114: evening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?"
LINE 115: Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship
LINE 116: existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,
LINE 117: in spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.
LINE 118: Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark
LINE 119: hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little
LINE 120: knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She
LINE 121: looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she
LINE 122: was; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had
LINE 123: been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative
LINE 124: of a sense of humor.
LINE 125: "We're all pretty well," said Mrs. Rachel. "I was kind of afraid _you_
LINE 126: weren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe
LINE 127: he was going to the doctor's."
LINE 128: Marilla's lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.
LINE 129: Rachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so
LINE 130: unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.
LINE 131: "Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday," she
LINE 132: said. "Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an
LINE 133: orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight."
LINE 134: If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a
LINE 135: kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.
LINE 136: She was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable
LINE 137: that Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to
LINE 138: suppose it.
LINE 139: "Are you in earnest, Marilla?" she demanded when voice returned to her.
LINE 140: "Yes, of course," said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums
LINE 141: in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated
LINE 142: Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.
LINE 143: Mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought
LINE 144: in exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people
LINE 145: adopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly
LINE 146: turning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!
LINE 147: Nothing!
LINE 148: "What on earth put such a notion into your head?" she demanded
LINE 149: disapprovingly.
LINE 150: This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be
LINE 151: disapproved.
LINE 152: "Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,"
LINE 153: returned Marilla. "Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before
LINE 154: Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the
LINE 155: asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.
LINE 156: Spencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have
LINE 157: talked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew
LINE 158: is getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he
LINE 159: once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate
LINE 160: hard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had
LINE 161: but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do
LINE 162: get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the
LINE 163: lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a
LINE 164: Home boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not
LINE 165: saying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give
LINE 166: me a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But
LINE 167: I'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born
LINE 168: Canadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out
LINE 169: one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she
LINE 170: was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody
LINE 171: to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that
LINE 172: would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores
LINE 173: right off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him
LINE 174: a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer
LINE 175: today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming
LINE 176: on the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to
LINE 177: meet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to
LINE 178: White Sands station herself."
LINE 179: Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to
LINE 180: speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece
LINE 181: of news.
LINE 182: "Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a
LINE 183: mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that's what. You don't know what
LINE 184: you're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your house and home
LINE 185: and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is
LINE 186: like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he's likely to turn out.
LINE 187: Why, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up
LINE 188: west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to
LINE 189: the house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to
LINE 190: a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used
LINE 191: to suck the eggs--they couldn't break him of it. If you had asked my
LINE 192: advice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for
LINE 193: mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what."
LINE 194: This Job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She
LINE 195: knitted steadily on.
LINE 196: "I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel. I've had some
LINE 197: qualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so
LINE 198: I gave in. It's so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he
LINE 199: does I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's
LINE 200: risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There's risks
LINE 201: in people's having children of their own if it comes to that--they don't
LINE 202: always turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.
LINE 203: It isn't as if we were getting him from England or the States. He can't
LINE 204: be much different from ourselves."
LINE 205: "Well, I hope it will turn out all right," said Mrs. Rachel in a tone
LINE 206: that plainly indicated her painful doubts. "Only don't say I didn't
LINE 207: warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well--I
LINE 208: heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did
LINE 209: that and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl
LINE 210: in that instance."
LINE 211: "Well, we're not getting a girl," said Marilla, as if poisoning wells
LINE 212: were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case
LINE 213: of a boy. "I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at
LINE 214: Mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, _she_ wouldn't shrink
LINE 215: from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head."
LINE 216: Mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his
LINE 217: imported orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at
LINE 218: least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert
LINE 219: Bell's and tell the news. It would certainly make a sensation second
LINE 220: to none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. So she took
LINE 221: herself away, somewhat to Marilla's relief, for the latter felt
LINE 222: her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel's
LINE 223: pessimism.
LINE 224: "Well, of all things that ever were or will be!" ejaculated Mrs. Rachel
LINE 225: when she was safely out in the lane. "It does really seem as if I must
LINE 226: be dreaming. Well, I'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake.
LINE 227: Matthew and Marilla don't know anything about children and they'll
LINE 228: expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so be's
LINE 229: he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think
LINE 230: of a child at Green Gables somehow; there's never been one there, for
LINE 231: Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built--if they
LINE 232: ever _were_ children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them.
LINE 233: I wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything. My, but I pity him,
LINE 234: that's what."
LINE 235: So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her
LINE 236: heart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently
LINE 237: at the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been
LINE 238: still deeper and more profound.
