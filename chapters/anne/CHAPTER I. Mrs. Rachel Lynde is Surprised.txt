LINE 59: CHAPTER I. Mrs. Rachel Lynde is Surprised
LINE 60: MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down
LINE 61: into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and
LINE 62: traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the
LINE 63: old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook
LINE 64: in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool
LINE 65: and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet,
LINE 66: well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.
LINE 67: Rachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it
LINE 68: probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,
LINE 69: keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children
LINE 70: up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never
LINE 71: rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.
LINE 72: There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend
LINE 73: closely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own;
LINE 74: but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage
LINE 75: their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a
LINE 76: notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she "ran" the
LINE 77: Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop
LINE 78: of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all
LINE 79: this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen
LINE 80: window, knitting "cotton warp" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,
LINE 81: as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping
LINE 82: a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up
LINE 83: the steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular
LINE 84: peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two
LINE 85: sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that
LINE 86: hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing
LINE 87: eye.
LINE 88: She was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in
LINE 89: at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house
LINE 90: was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of
LINE 91: bees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called "Rachel
LINE 92: Lynde's husband"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field
LINE 93: beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on
LINE 94: the big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew
LINE 95: that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening
LINE 96: before in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow
LINE 97: his turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for
LINE 98: Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about
LINE 99: anything in his whole life.
LINE 100: And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon
LINE 101: of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;
LINE 102: moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was
LINE 103: plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy
LINE 104: and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable
LINE 105: distance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going
LINE 106: there?
LINE 107: Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this
LINE 108: and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both
LINE 109: questions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be
LINE 110: something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest
LINE 111: man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where
LINE 112: he might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and
LINE 113: driving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel,
LINE 114: ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon's
LINE 115: enjoyment was spoiled.
LINE 116: "I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla
LINE 117: where he's gone and why," the worthy woman finally concluded. "He
LINE 118: doesn't generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if
LINE 119: he'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to
LINE 120: go for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.
LINE 121: Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I'm
LINE 122: clean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or
LINE 123: conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea
LINE 124: today."
LINE 125: Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the
LINE 126: big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a
LINE 127: scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde's Hollow. To be sure, the
LINE 128: long lane made it a good deal further. Matthew Cuthbert's father, as
LINE 129: shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly
LINE 130: could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods
LINE 131: when he founded his homestead. Green Gables was built at the furthest
LINE 132: edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible
LINE 133: from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so
LINE 134: sociably situated. Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place
LINE 135: _living_ at all.
LINE 136: "It's just _staying_, that's what," she said as she stepped along the
LINE 137: deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. "It's no wonder
LINE 138: Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by
LINE 139: themselves. Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were
LINE 140: there'd be enough of them. I'd ruther look at people. To be sure, they
LINE 141: seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they're used to it. A body
LINE 142: can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said."
LINE 143: With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green
LINE 144: Gables. Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one
LINE 145: side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies.
LINE 146: Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have
LINE 147: seen it if there had been. Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla
LINE 148: Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house. One could
LINE 149: have eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial
LINE 150: peck of dirt.
LINE 151: Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in
LINE 152: when bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful
LINE 153: apartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully
LINE 154: clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its
LINE 155: windows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on
LINE 156: the back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,
LINE 157: whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left
LINE 158: orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,
LINE 159: was greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when
LINE 160: she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to
LINE 161: her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to
LINE 162: be taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind
LINE 163: her was laid for supper.
LINE 164: Mrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental
LINE 165: note of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,
LINE 166: so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but
LINE 167: the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves
LINE 168: and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any
LINE 169: particular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel
LINE 170: mare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery
LINE 171: about quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.
LINE 172: "Good evening, Rachel," Marilla said briskly. "This is a real fine
LINE 173: evening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?"
LINE 174: Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship
LINE 175: existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,
LINE 176: in spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.
LINE 177: Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark
LINE 178: hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little
LINE 179: knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She
LINE 180: looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she
LINE 181: was; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had
LINE 182: been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative
LINE 183: of a sense of humor.
LINE 184: "We're all pretty well," said Mrs. Rachel. "I was kind of afraid _you_
LINE 185: weren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe
LINE 186: he was going to the doctor's."
LINE 187: Marilla's lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.
LINE 188: Rachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so
LINE 189: unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.
LINE 190: "Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday," she
LINE 191: said. "Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an
LINE 192: orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight."
LINE 193: If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a
LINE 194: kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.
LINE 195: She was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable
LINE 196: that Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to
LINE 197: suppose it.
LINE 198: "Are you in earnest, Marilla?" she demanded when voice returned to her.
LINE 199: "Yes, of course," said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums
LINE 200: in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated
LINE 201: Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.
LINE 202: Mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought
LINE 203: in exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people
LINE 204: adopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly
LINE 205: turning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!
LINE 206: Nothing!
LINE 207: "What on earth put such a notion into your head?" she demanded
LINE 208: disapprovingly.
LINE 209: This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be
LINE 210: disapproved.
LINE 211: "Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,"
LINE 212: returned Marilla. "Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before
LINE 213: Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the
LINE 214: asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.
LINE 215: Spencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have
LINE 216: talked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew
LINE 217: is getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he
LINE 218: once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate
LINE 219: hard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had
LINE 220: but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do
LINE 221: get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the
LINE 222: lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a
LINE 223: Home boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not
LINE 224: saying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give
LINE 225: me a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But
LINE 226: I'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born
LINE 227: Canadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out
LINE 228: one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she
LINE 229: was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody
LINE 230: to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that
LINE 231: would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores
LINE 232: right off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him
LINE 233: a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer
LINE 234: today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming
LINE 235: on the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to
LINE 236: meet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to
LINE 237: White Sands station herself."
LINE 238: Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to
LINE 239: speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece
LINE 240: of news.
LINE 241: "Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a
LINE 242: mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that's what. You don't know what
LINE 243: you're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your house and home
LINE 244: and you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is
LINE 245: like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he's likely to turn out.
LINE 246: Why, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up
LINE 247: west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to
LINE 248: the house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to
LINE 249: a crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used
LINE 250: to suck the eggs--they couldn't break him of it. If you had asked my
LINE 251: advice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for
LINE 252: mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what."
LINE 253: This Job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She
LINE 254: knitted steadily on.
LINE 255: "I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel. I've had some
LINE 256: qualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so
LINE 257: I gave in. It's so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he
LINE 258: does I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's
LINE 259: risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There's risks
LINE 260: in people's having children of their own if it comes to that--they don't
LINE 261: always turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.
LINE 262: It isn't as if we were getting him from England or the States. He can't
LINE 263: be much different from ourselves."
LINE 264: "Well, I hope it will turn out all right," said Mrs. Rachel in a tone
LINE 265: that plainly indicated her painful doubts. "Only don't say I didn't
LINE 266: warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well--I
LINE 267: heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did
LINE 268: that and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl
LINE 269: in that instance."
LINE 270: "Well, we're not getting a girl," said Marilla, as if poisoning wells
LINE 271: were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case
LINE 272: of a boy. "I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at
LINE 273: Mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, _she_ wouldn't shrink
LINE 274: from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head."
LINE 275: Mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his
LINE 276: imported orphan. But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at
LINE 277: least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert
LINE 278: Bell's and tell the news. It would certainly make a sensation second
LINE 279: to none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. So she took
LINE 280: herself away, somewhat to Marilla's relief, for the latter felt
LINE 281: her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel's
LINE 282: pessimism.
LINE 283: "Well, of all things that ever were or will be!" ejaculated Mrs. Rachel
LINE 284: when she was safely out in the lane. "It does really seem as if I must
LINE 285: be dreaming. Well, I'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake.
LINE 286: Matthew and Marilla don't know anything about children and they'll
LINE 287: expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather, if so be's
LINE 288: he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful. It seems uncanny to think
LINE 289: of a child at Green Gables somehow; there's never been one there, for
LINE 290: Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built--if they
LINE 291: ever _were_ children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them.
LINE 292: I wouldn't be in that orphan's shoes for anything. My, but I pity him,
LINE 293: that's what."
LINE 294: So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her
LINE 295: heart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently
LINE 296: at the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been
LINE 297: still deeper and more profound.
