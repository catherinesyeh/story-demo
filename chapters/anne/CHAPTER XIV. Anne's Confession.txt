LINE 1: ON the Monday evening before the picnic Marilla came down from her room
LINE 2: with a troubled face.
LINE 3: "Anne," she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the
LINE 4: spotless table and singing, "Nelly of the Hazel Dell" with a vigor and
LINE 5: expression that did credit to Diana's teaching, "did you see anything
LINE 6: of my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came
LINE 7: home from church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere."
LINE 8: "I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society," said
LINE 9: Anne, a little slowly. "I was passing your door when I saw it on the
LINE 10: cushion, so I went in to look at it."
LINE 11: "Did you touch it?" said Marilla sternly.
LINE 12: "Y-e-e-s," admitted Anne, "I took it up and I pinned it on my breast
LINE 13: just to see how it would look."
LINE 14: "You had no business to do anything of the sort. It's very wrong in a
LINE 15: little girl to meddle. You shouldn't have gone into my room in the first
LINE 16: place and you shouldn't have touched a brooch that didn't belong to you
LINE 17: in the second. Where did you put it?"
LINE 18: "Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn't it on a minute. Truly, I
LINE 19: didn't mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn't think about its being wrong to
LINE 20: go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I'll never
LINE 21: do it again. That's one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty
LINE 22: thing twice."
LINE 23: "You didn't put it back," said Marilla. "That brooch isn't anywhere on
LINE 24: the bureau. You've taken it out or something, Anne."
LINE 25: "I did put it back," said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought. "I
LINE 26: don't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in
LINE 27: the china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back."
LINE 28: "I'll go and have another look," said Marilla, determining to be just.
LINE 29: "If you put that brooch back it's there still. If it isn't I'll know you
LINE 30: didn't, that's all!"
LINE 31: Marilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the
LINE 32: bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly
LINE 33: be. It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.
LINE 34: "Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last
LINE 35: person to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth
LINE 36: at once. Did you take it out and lose it?"
LINE 37: "No, I didn't," said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla's angry gaze
LINE 38: squarely. "I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the
LINE 39: truth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I'm not very
LINE 40: certain what a block is. So there, Marilla."
LINE 41: Anne's "so there" was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but
LINE 42: Marilla took it as a display of defiance.
LINE 43: "I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne," she said sharply. "I
LINE 44: know you are. There now, don't say anything more unless you are prepared
LINE 45: to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are
LINE 46: ready to confess."
LINE 47: "Will I take the peas with me?" said Anne meekly.
LINE 48: "No, I'll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you."
LINE 49: When Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very
LINE 50: disturbed state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What
LINE 51: if Anne had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken
LINE 52: it, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face,
LINE 53: too!
LINE 54: "I don't know what I wouldn't sooner have had happen," thought Marilla,
LINE 55: as she nervously shelled the peas. "Of course, I don't suppose she meant
LINE 56: to steal it or anything like that. She's just taken it to play with
LINE 57: or help along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that's
LINE 58: clear, for there hasn't been a soul in that room since she was in it, by
LINE 59: her own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there's
LINE 60: nothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for
LINE 61: fear she'll be punished. It's a dreadful thing to think she tells
LINE 62: falsehoods. It's a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It's a
LINE 63: fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can't trust.
LINE 64: Slyness and untruthfulness--that's what she has displayed. I declare I
LINE 65: feel worse about that than about the brooch. If she'd only have told the
LINE 66: truth about it I wouldn't mind so much."
LINE 67: Marilla went to her room at intervals all through the evening and
LINE 68: searched for the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the
LINE 69: east gable produced no result. Anne persisted in denying that she knew
LINE 70: anything about the brooch but Marilla was only the more firmly convinced
LINE 71: that she did.
LINE 72: She told Matthew the story the next morning. Matthew was confounded and
LINE 73: puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he had to admit
LINE 74: that circumstances were against her.
LINE 75: "You're sure it hasn't fell down behind the bureau?" was the only
LINE 76: suggestion he could offer.
LINE 77: "I've moved the bureau and I've taken out the drawers and I've looked
LINE 78: in every crack and cranny" was Marilla's positive answer. "The brooch
LINE 79: is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it. That's the plain,
LINE 80: ugly truth, Matthew Cuthbert, and we might as well look it in the face."
LINE 81: "Well now, what are you going to do about it?" Matthew asked forlornly,
LINE 82: feeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he had to deal with the
LINE 83: situation. He felt no desire to put his oar in this time.
LINE 84: "She'll stay in her room until she confesses," said Marilla grimly,
LINE 85: remembering the success of this method in the former case. "Then we'll
LINE 86: see. Perhaps we'll be able to find the brooch if she'll only tell
LINE 87: where she took it; but in any case she'll have to be severely punished,
LINE 88: Matthew."
LINE 89: "Well now, you'll have to punish her," said Matthew, reaching for his
LINE 90: hat. "I've nothing to do with it, remember. You warned me off yourself."
LINE 91: Marilla felt deserted by everyone. She could not even go to Mrs. Lynde
LINE 92: for advice. She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and
LINE 93: left it with a face more serious still. Anne steadfastly refused to
LINE 94: confess. She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch.
LINE 95: The child had evidently been crying and Marilla felt a pang of pity
LINE 96: which she sternly repressed. By night she was, as she expressed it,
LINE 97: "beat out."
LINE 98: "You'll stay in this room until you confess, Anne. You can make up your
LINE 99: mind to that," she said firmly.
LINE 100: "But the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla," cried Anne. "You won't keep me
LINE 101: from going to that, will you? You'll just let me out for the afternoon,
LINE 102: won't you? Then I'll stay here as long as you like _afterwards_
LINE 103: cheerfully. But I _must_ go to the picnic."
LINE 104: "You'll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you've confessed,
LINE 105: Anne."
LINE 106: "Oh, Marilla," gasped Anne.
LINE 107: But Marilla had gone out and shut the door.
LINE 108: Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to
LINE 109: order for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies
LINE 110: in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless
LINE 111: winds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms
LINE 112: like spirits of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful
LINE 113: hands as if watching for Anne's usual morning greeting from the east
LINE 114: gable. But Anne was not at her window. When Marilla took her breakfast
LINE 115: up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and
LINE 116: resolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.
LINE 117: "Marilla, I'm ready to confess."
LINE 118: "Ah!" Marilla laid down her tray. Once again her method had succeeded;
LINE 119: but her success was very bitter to her. "Let me hear what you have to
LINE 120: say then, Anne."
LINE 121: "I took the amethyst brooch," said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she
LINE 122: had learned. "I took it just as you said. I didn't mean to take it when
LINE 123: I went in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my
LINE 124: breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how
LINE 125: perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was
LINE 126: the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I
LINE 127: was the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and
LINE 128: I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to
LINE 129: amethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before
LINE 130: you came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the
LINE 131: time. When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters
LINE 132: I took the brooch off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine
LINE 133: in the sunlight! And then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it
LINE 134: just slipped through my fingers--so--and went down--down--down, all
LINE 135: purply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining
LINE 136: Waters. And that's the best I can do at confessing, Marilla."
LINE 137: Marilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again. This child had
LINE 138: taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly
LINE 139: reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or
LINE 140: repentance.
LINE 141: "Anne, this is terrible," she said, trying to speak calmly. "You are the
LINE 142: very wickedest girl I ever heard of."
LINE 143: "Yes, I suppose I am," agreed Anne tranquilly. "And I know I'll have to
LINE 144: be punished. It'll be your duty to punish me, Marilla. Won't you please
LINE 145: get it over right off because I'd like to go to the picnic with nothing
LINE 146: on my mind."
LINE 147: "Picnic, indeed! You'll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That shall
LINE 148: be your punishment. And it isn't half severe enough either for what
LINE 149: you've done!"
LINE 150: "Not go to the picnic!" Anne sprang to her feet and clutched Marilla's
LINE 151: hand. "But you _promised_ me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the
LINE 152: picnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that.
LINE 153: Oh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice
LINE 154: cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice
LINE 155: cream again."
LINE 156: Marilla disengaged Anne's clinging hands stonily.
LINE 157: "You needn't plead, Anne. You are not going to the picnic and that's
LINE 158: final. No, not a word."
LINE 159: Anne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She clasped her hands
LINE 160: together, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face
LINE 161: downward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of
LINE 162: disappointment and despair.
LINE 163: "For the land's sake!" gasped Marilla, hastening from the room. "I
LINE 164: believe the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave as she
LINE 165: does. If she isn't she's utterly bad. Oh dear, I'm afraid Rachel was
LINE 166: right from the first. But I've put my hand to the plow and I won't look
LINE 167: back."
LINE 168: That was a dismal morning. Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the
LINE 169: porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to
LINE 170: do. Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it--but Marilla did. Then
LINE 171: she went out and raked the yard.
LINE 172: When dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne. A
LINE 173: tear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.
LINE 174: "Come down to your dinner, Anne."
LINE 175: "I don't want any dinner, Marilla," said Anne, sobbingly. "I couldn't
LINE 176: eat anything. My heart is broken. You'll feel remorse of conscience
LINE 177: someday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember
LINE 178: when the time comes that I forgive you. But please don't ask me to eat
LINE 179: anything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are
LINE 180: so unromantic when one is in affliction."
LINE 181: Exasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale
LINE 182: of woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful
LINE 183: sympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.
LINE 184: "Well now, she shouldn't have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories
LINE 185: about it," he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic
LINE 186: pork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to
LINE 187: crises of feeling, "but she's such a little thing--such an interesting
LINE 188: little thing. Don't you think it's pretty rough not to let her go to the
LINE 189: picnic when she's so set on it?"
LINE 190: "Matthew Cuthbert, I'm amazed at you. I think I've let her off entirely
LINE 191: too easy. And she doesn't appear to realize how wicked she's been at
LINE 192: all--that's what worries me most. If she'd really felt sorry it wouldn't
LINE 193: be so bad. And you don't seem to realize it, neither; you're making
LINE 194: excuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that."
LINE 195: "Well now, she's such a little thing," feebly reiterated Matthew. "And
LINE 196: there should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she's never had any
LINE 197: bringing up."
LINE 198: "Well, she's having it now" retorted Marilla.
LINE 199: The retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was
LINE 200: a very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote,
LINE 201: the hired boy, and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal
LINE 202: insult.
LINE 203: When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed
LINE 204: Marilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black
LINE 205: lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning
LINE 206: from the Ladies' Aid.
LINE 207: She would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her trunk. As
LINE 208: Marilla lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that
LINE 209: clustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the
LINE 210: shawl--something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light.
LINE 211: Marilla snatched at it with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging
LINE 212: to a thread of the lace by its catch!
LINE 213: "Dear life and heart," said Marilla blankly, "what does this mean?
LINE 214: Here's my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of
LINE 215: Barry's pond. Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost
LINE 216: it? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that
LINE 217: when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a
LINE 218: minute. I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!"
LINE 219: Marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried
LINE 220: herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.
LINE 221: "Anne Shirley," said Marilla solemnly, "I've just found my brooch
LINE 222: hanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole
LINE 223: you told me this morning meant."
LINE 224: "Why, you said you'd keep me here until I confessed," returned Anne
LINE 225: wearily, "and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the
LINE 226: picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and
LINE 227: made it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I
LINE 228: wouldn't forget it. But you wouldn't let me go to the picnic after all,
LINE 229: so all my trouble was wasted."
LINE 230: Marilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked
LINE 231: her.
LINE 232: "Anne, you do beat all! But I was wrong--I see that now. I shouldn't
LINE 233: have doubted your word when I'd never known you to tell a story.
LINE 234: Of course, it wasn't right for you to confess to a thing you hadn't
LINE 235: done--it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you'll
LINE 236: forgive me, Anne, I'll forgive you and we'll start square again. And now
LINE 237: get yourself ready for the picnic."
LINE 238: Anne flew up like a rocket.
LINE 239: "Oh, Marilla, isn't it too late?"
LINE 240: "No, it's only two o'clock. They won't be more than well gathered yet
LINE 241: and it'll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your
LINE 242: hair and put on your gingham. I'll fill a basket for you. There's plenty
LINE 243: of stuff baked in the house. And I'll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel
LINE 244: and drive you down to the picnic ground."
LINE 245: "Oh, Marilla," exclaimed Anne, flying to the washstand. "Five minutes
LINE 246: ago I was so miserable I was wishing I'd never been born and now I
LINE 247: wouldn't change places with an angel!"
LINE 248: That night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to
LINE 249: Green Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.
LINE 250: "Oh, Marilla, I've had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is a
LINE 251: new word I learned today. I heard Mary Alice Bell use it. Isn't it very
LINE 252: expressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr.
LINE 253: Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters--six
LINE 254: of us at a time. And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard. She was leaning
LINE 255: out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn't caught her by her
LINE 256: sash just in the nick of time she'd fallen in and prob'ly been drowned.
LINE 257: I wish it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to
LINE 258: have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And
LINE 259: we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Marilla,
LINE 260: I assure you it was sublime."
LINE 261: That evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her stocking
LINE 262: basket.
LINE 263: "I'm willing to own up that I made a mistake," she concluded candidly,
LINE 264: "but I've learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think of Anne's
LINE 265: 'confession,' although I suppose I shouldn't for it really was a
LINE 266: falsehood. But it doesn't seem as bad as the other would have been,
LINE 267: somehow, and anyhow I'm responsible for it. That child is hard to
LINE 268: understand in some respects. But I believe she'll turn out all right
LINE 269: yet. And there's one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that
LINE 270: she's in."
