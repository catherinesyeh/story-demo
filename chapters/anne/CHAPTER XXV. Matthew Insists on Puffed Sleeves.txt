LINE 1: MATTHEW was having a bad ten minutes of it. He had come into the
LINE 2: kitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat
LINE 3: down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots, unconscious of
LINE 4: the fact that Anne and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice
LINE 5: of "The Fairy Queen" in the sitting room. Presently they came trooping
LINE 6: through the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering
LINE 7: gaily. They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully back into the
LINE 8: shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the
LINE 9: other, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they
LINE 10: put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert.
LINE 11: Anne stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew
LINE 12: suddenly became conscious that there was something about her different
LINE 13: from her mates. And what worried Matthew was that the difference
LINE 14: impressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne had a
LINE 15: brighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features
LINE 16: than the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note
LINE 17: of these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist
LINE 18: in any of these respects. Then in what did it consist?
LINE 19: Matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm
LINE 20: in arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself
LINE 21: to her books. He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be
LINE 22: quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she
LINE 23: saw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their
LINE 24: tongues quiet while Anne never did. This, Matthew felt, would be no
LINE 25: great help.
LINE 26: He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much
LINE 27: to Marilla's disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection
LINE 28: Matthew arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not dressed like
LINE 29: the other girls!
LINE 30: The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that
LINE 31: Anne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she had
LINE 32: come to Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses,
LINE 33: all made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was
LINE 34: such a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was
LINE 35: quite sure that Anne's sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the
LINE 36: other girls wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen
LINE 37: around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink
LINE 38: and white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and
LINE 39: soberly gowned.
LINE 40: Of course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was
LINE 41: bringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served
LINE 42: thereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty
LINE 43: dress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that
LINE 44: he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an
LINE 45: unwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off.
LINE 46: A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. Matthew, with a
LINE 47: sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while Marilla
LINE 48: opened all the doors and aired the house.
LINE 49: The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the
LINE 50: dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would
LINE 51: be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew
LINE 52: could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be
LINE 53: at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress.
LINE 54: After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson's store
LINE 55: instead of William Blair's. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to
LINE 56: William Blair's; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them
LINE 57: as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William
LINE 58: Blair's two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew
LINE 59: held them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he
LINE 60: knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter
LINE 61: as this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he
LINE 62: must be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson's,
LINE 63: where Samuel or his son would wait on him.
LINE 64: Alas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his
LINE 65: business, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife's
LINE 66: and a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour,
LINE 67: big, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She
LINE 68: was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets
LINE 69: that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.
LINE 70: Matthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and
LINE 71: those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.
LINE 72: "What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?" Miss Lucilla Harris
LINE 73: inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both
LINE 74: hands.
LINE 75: "Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?" stammered
LINE 76: Matthew.
LINE 77: Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man
LINE 78: inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.
LINE 79: "I believe we have one or two left over," she said, "but they're
LINE 80: upstairs in the lumber room. I'll go and see." During her absence
LINE 81: Matthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.
LINE 82: When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:
LINE 83: "Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?" Matthew took his courage in
LINE 84: both hands and replied: "Well now, since you suggest it, I might as
LINE 85: well--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed."
LINE 86: Miss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded
LINE 87: that he was entirely crazy.
LINE 88: "We only keep hayseed in the spring," she explained loftily. "We've none
LINE 89: on hand just now."
LINE 90: "Oh, certainly--certainly--just as you say," stammered unhappy
LINE 91: Matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he
LINE 92: recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.
LINE 93: While Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for
LINE 94: a final desperate attempt.
LINE 95: "Well now--if it isn't too much trouble--I might as well--that is--I'd
LINE 96: like to look at--at--some sugar."
LINE 97: "White or brown?" queried Miss Harris patiently.
LINE 98: "Oh--well now--brown," said Matthew feebly.
LINE 99: "There's a barrel of it over there," said Miss Harris, shaking her
LINE 100: bangles at it. "It's the only kind we have."
LINE 101: "I'll--I'll take twenty pounds of it," said Matthew, with beads of
LINE 102: perspiration standing on his forehead.
LINE 103: Matthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It had
LINE 104: been a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for
LINE 105: committing the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached
LINE 106: home he hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to
LINE 107: Marilla.
LINE 108: "Brown sugar!" exclaimed Marilla. "Whatever possessed you to get so
LINE 109: much? You know I never use it except for the hired man's porridge or
LINE 110: black fruit cake. Jerry's gone and I've made my cake long ago. It's not
LINE 111: good sugar, either--it's coarse and dark--William Blair doesn't usually
LINE 112: keep sugar like that."
LINE 113: "I--I thought it might come in handy sometime," said Matthew, making
LINE 114: good his escape.
LINE 115: When Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was
LINE 116: required to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question.
LINE 117: Matthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once.
LINE 118: Remained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew
LINE 119: have dared to ask advice. To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that
LINE 120: good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man's hands.
LINE 121: "Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I'm going to
LINE 122: Carmody tomorrow and I'll attend to it. Have you something particular in
LINE 123: mind? No? Well, I'll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice
LINE 124: rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria
LINE 125: in that's real pretty. Perhaps you'd like me to make it up for her, too,
LINE 126: seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it
LINE 127: before the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I'll do it. No, it isn't
LINE 128: a mite of trouble. I like sewing. I'll make it to fit my niece, Jenny
LINE 129: Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes."
LINE 130: "Well now, I'm much obliged," said Matthew, "and--and--I dunno--but I'd
LINE 131: like--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used
LINE 132: to be. If it wouldn't be asking too much I--I'd like them made in the
LINE 133: new way."
LINE 134: "Puffs? Of course. You needn't worry a speck more about it, Matthew.
LINE 135: I'll make it up in the very latest fashion," said Mrs. Lynde. To herself
LINE 136: she added when Matthew had gone:
LINE 137: "It'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something
LINE 138: decent for once. The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous,
LINE 139: that's what, and I've ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times. I've
LINE 140: held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn't want advice and she
LINE 141: thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all
LINE 142: she's an old maid. But that's always the way. Folks that has brought up
LINE 143: children know that there's no hard and fast method in the world that'll
LINE 144: suit every child. But them as never have think it's all as plain and
LINE 145: easy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so fashion, and
LINE 146: the sum 'll work out correct. But flesh and blood don't come under the
LINE 147: head of arithmetic and that's where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake.
LINE 148: I suppose she's trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by
LINE 149: dressing her as she does; but it's more likely to cultivate envy and
LINE 150: discontent. I'm sure the child must feel the difference between her
LINE 151: clothes and the other girls'. But to think of Matthew taking notice of
LINE 152: it! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years."
LINE 153: Marilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on
LINE 154: his mind, but what it was she could not guess, until Christmas Eve, when
LINE 155: Mrs. Lynde brought up the new dress. Marilla behaved pretty well on the
LINE 156: whole, although it is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde's diplomatic
LINE 157: explanation that she had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne
LINE 158: would find out about it too soon if Marilla made it.
LINE 159: "So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and
LINE 160: grinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?" she said a little
LINE 161: stiffly but tolerantly. "I knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I
LINE 162: must say I don't think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three
LINE 163: good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer
LINE 164: extravagance. There's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a
LINE 165: waist, I declare there is. You'll just pamper Anne's vanity, Matthew,
LINE 166: and she's as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she'll be satisfied
LINE 167: at last, for I know she's been hankering after those silly sleeves ever
LINE 168: since they came in, although she never said a word after the first. The
LINE 169: puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they're
LINE 170: as big as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears them will have to go
LINE 171: through a door sideways."
LINE 172: Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very
LINE 173: mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but
LINE 174: just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne
LINE 175: peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs
LINE 176: in the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches
LINE 177: and wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were
LINE 178: stretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that
LINE 179: was glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed
LINE 180: through Green Gables.
LINE 181: "Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn't it a lovely
LINE 182: Christmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't
LINE 183: seem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not
LINE 184: green--they're just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call
LINE 185: them green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!"
LINE 186: Matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and
LINE 187: held it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be
LINE 188: contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene
LINE 189: out of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.
LINE 190: Anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty
LINE 191: it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt
LINE 192: with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the
LINE 193: most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.
LINE 194: But the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and
LINE 195: above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of
LINE 196: brown-silk ribbon.
LINE 197: "That's a Christmas present for you, Anne," said Matthew shyly.
LINE 198: "Why--why--Anne, don't you like it? Well now--well now."
LINE 199: For Anne's eyes had suddenly filled with tears.
LINE 200: "Like it! Oh, Matthew!" Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped
LINE 201: her hands. "Matthew, it's perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you
LINE 202: enough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy
LINE 203: dream."
LINE 204: "Well, well, let us have breakfast," interrupted Marilla. "I must say,
LINE 205: Anne, I don't think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it
LINE 206: for you, see that you take good care of it. There's a hair ribbon Mrs.
LINE 207: Lynde left for you. It's brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in."
LINE 208: "I don't see how I'm going to eat breakfast," said Anne rapturously.
LINE 209: "Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I'd rather
LINE 210: feast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still
LINE 211: fashionable. It did seem to me that I'd never get over it if they went
LINE 212: out before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied,
LINE 213: you see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel
LINE 214: that I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It's at times like this I'm
LINE 215: sorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will
LINE 216: be in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when
LINE 217: irresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort
LINE 218: after this."
LINE 219: When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the
LINE 220: white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson
LINE 221: ulster. Anne flew down the slope to meet her.
LINE 222: "Merry Christmas, Diana! And oh, it's a wonderful Christmas. I've
LINE 223: something splendid to show you. Matthew has given me the loveliest
LINE 224: dress, with _such_ sleeves. I couldn't even imagine any nicer."
LINE 225: "I've got something more for you," said Diana breathlessly. "Here--this
LINE 226: box. Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in
LINE 227: it--and this is for you. I'd have brought it over last night, but it
LINE 228: didn't come until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming
LINE 229: through the Haunted Wood in the dark now."
LINE 230: Anne opened the box and peeped in. First a card with "For the Anne-girl
LINE 231: and Merry Christmas," written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest
LINE 232: little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening
LINE 233: buckles.
LINE 234: "Oh," said Anne, "Diana, this is too much. I must be dreaming."
LINE 235: "I call it providential," said Diana. "You won't have to borrow Ruby's
LINE 236: slippers now, and that's a blessing, for they're two sizes too big for
LINE 237: you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling. Josie Pye would
LINE 238: be delighted. Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the
LINE 239: practice night before last. Did you ever hear anything equal to that?"
LINE 240: All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the
LINE 241: hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.
LINE 242: The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success. The
LINE 243: little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but
LINE 244: Anne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in
LINE 245: the shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny.
LINE 246: "Oh, hasn't it been a brilliant evening?" sighed Anne, when it was all
LINE 247: over and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry
LINE 248: sky.
LINE 249: "Everything went off very well," said Diana practically. "I guess we
LINE 250: must have made as much as ten dollars. Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to
LINE 251: send an account of it to the Charlottetown papers."
LINE 252: "Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print? It makes me thrill to
LINE 253: think of it. Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana. I felt prouder than
LINE 254: you did when it was encored. I just said to myself, 'It is my dear bosom
LINE 255: friend who is so honored.'"
LINE 256: "Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne. That sad one
LINE 257: was simply splendid."
LINE 258: "Oh, I was so nervous, Diana. When Mr. Allan called out my name I really
LINE 259: cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform. I felt as if a million
LINE 260: eyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I
LINE 261: was sure I couldn't begin at all. Then I thought of my lovely puffed
LINE 262: sleeves and took courage. I knew that I must live up to those sleeves,
LINE 263: Diana. So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so
LINE 264: far away. I just felt like a parrot. It's providential that I practiced
LINE 265: those recitations so often up in the garret, or I'd never have been able
LINE 266: to get through. Did I groan all right?"
LINE 267: "Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely," assured Diana.
LINE 268: "I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down. It was
LINE 269: splendid to think I had touched somebody's heart. It's so romantic
LINE 270: to take part in a concert, isn't it? Oh, it's been a very memorable
LINE 271: occasion indeed."
LINE 272: "Wasn't the boys' dialogue fine?" said Diana. "Gilbert Blythe was just
LINE 273: splendid. Anne, I do think it's awful mean the way you treat Gil. Wait
LINE 274: till I tell you. When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue
LINE 275: one of your roses fell out of your hair. I saw Gil pick it up and put
LINE 276: it in his breast pocket. There now. You're so romantic that I'm sure you
LINE 277: ought to be pleased at that."
LINE 278: "It's nothing to me what that person does," said Anne loftily. "I simply
LINE 279: never waste a thought on him, Diana."
LINE 280: That night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the
LINE 281: first time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after
LINE 282: Anne had gone to bed.
LINE 283: "Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them," said Matthew
LINE 284: proudly.
LINE 285: "Yes, she did," admitted Marilla. "She's a bright child, Matthew. And
LINE 286: she looked real nice too. I've been kind of opposed to this concert
LINE 287: scheme, but I suppose there's no real harm in it after all. Anyhow, I
LINE 288: was proud of Anne tonight, although I'm not going to tell her so."
LINE 289: "Well now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so 'fore she went
LINE 290: upstairs," said Matthew. "We must see what we can do for her some of
LINE 291: these days, Marilla. I guess she'll need something more than Avonlea
LINE 292: school by and by."
LINE 293: "There's time enough to think of that," said Marilla. "She's only
LINE 294: thirteen in March. Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a
LINE 295: big girl. Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes Anne
LINE 296: look so tall. She's quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do
LINE 297: for her will be to send her to Queen's after a spell. But nothing need
LINE 298: be said about that for a year or two yet."
LINE 299: "Well now, it'll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on," said
LINE 300: Matthew. "Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking
LINE 301: over."
