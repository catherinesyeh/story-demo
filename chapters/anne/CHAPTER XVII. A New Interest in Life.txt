LINE 1: THE next afternoon Anne, bending over her patchwork at the kitchen
LINE 2: window, happened to glance out and beheld Diana down by the Dryad's
LINE 3: Bubble beckoning mysteriously. In a trice Anne was out of the house
LINE 4: and flying down to the hollow, astonishment and hope struggling in
LINE 5: her expressive eyes. But the hope faded when she saw Diana's dejected
LINE 6: countenance.
LINE 7: "Your mother hasn't relented?" she gasped.
LINE 8: Diana shook her head mournfully.
LINE 9: "No; and oh, Anne, she says I'm never to play with you again. I've cried
LINE 10: and cried and I told her it wasn't your fault, but it wasn't any use. I
LINE 11: had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to
LINE 12: you. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she's timing me by the
LINE 13: clock."
LINE 14: "Ten minutes isn't very long to say an eternal farewell in," said Anne
LINE 15: tearfully. "Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget
LINE 16: me, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress
LINE 17: thee?"
LINE 18: "Indeed I will," sobbed Diana, "and I'll never have another bosom
LINE 19: friend--I don't want to have. I couldn't love anybody as I love you."
LINE 20: "Oh, Diana," cried Anne, clasping her hands, "do you _love_ me?"
LINE 21: "Why, of course I do. Didn't you know that?"
LINE 22: "No." Anne drew a long breath. "I thought you _liked_ me of course but I
LINE 23: never hoped you _loved_ me. Why, Diana, I didn't think anybody could
LINE 24: love me. Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember. Oh, this is
LINE 25: wonderful! It's a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness
LINE 26: of a path severed from thee, Diana. Oh, just say it once again."
LINE 27: "I love you devotedly, Anne," said Diana stanchly, "and I always will,
LINE 28: you may be sure of that."
LINE 29: "And I will always love thee, Diana," said Anne, solemnly extending her
LINE 30: hand. "In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my
LINE 31: lonely life, as that last story we read together says. Diana, wilt
LINE 32: thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure
LINE 33: forevermore?"
LINE 34: "Have you got anything to cut it with?" queried Diana, wiping away the
LINE 35: tears which Anne's affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and
LINE 36: returning to practicalities.
LINE 37: "Yes. I've got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,"
LINE 38: said Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana's curls. "Fare thee well,
LINE 39: my beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side
LINE 40: by side. But my heart will ever be faithful to thee."
LINE 41: Anne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand
LINE 42: to the latter whenever she turned to look back. Then she returned to
LINE 43: the house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic
LINE 44: parting.
LINE 45: "It is all over," she informed Marilla. "I shall never have another
LINE 46: friend. I'm really worse off than ever before, for I haven't Katie
LINE 47: Maurice and Violetta now. And even if I had it wouldn't be the same.
LINE 48: Somehow, little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend.
LINE 49: Diana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring. It will
LINE 50: be sacred in my memory forever. I used the most pathetic language I
LINE 51: could think of and said 'thou' and 'thee.' 'Thou' and 'thee' seem so
LINE 52: much more romantic than 'you.' Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I'm
LINE 53: going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my
LINE 54: life. Please see that it is buried with me, for I don't believe I'll
LINE 55: live very long. Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her
LINE 56: Mrs. Barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let Diana
LINE 57: come to my funeral."
LINE 58: "I don't think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you
LINE 59: can talk, Anne," said Marilla unsympathetically.
LINE 60: The following Monday Anne surprised Marilla by coming down from her room
LINE 61: with her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into
LINE 62: a line of determination.
LINE 63: "I'm going back to school," she announced. "That is all there is left
LINE 64: in life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me. In
LINE 65: school I can look at her and muse over days departed."
LINE 66: "You'd better muse over your lessons and sums," said Marilla, concealing
LINE 67: her delight at this development of the situation. "If you're going back
LINE 68: to school I hope we'll hear no more of breaking slates over people's
LINE 69: heads and such carryings on. Behave yourself and do just what your
LINE 70: teacher tells you."
LINE 71: "I'll try to be a model pupil," agreed Anne dolefully. "There won't be
LINE 72: much fun in it, I expect. Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model
LINE 73: pupil and there isn't a spark of imagination or life in her. She is
LINE 74: just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. But I feel so
LINE 75: depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now. I'm going round by
LINE 76: the road. I couldn't bear to go by the Birch Path all alone. I should
LINE 77: weep bitter tears if I did."
LINE 78: Anne was welcomed back to school with open arms. Her imagination had
LINE 79: been sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic
LINE 80: ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. Ruby Gillis
LINE 81: smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading; Ella May
LINE 82: MacPherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a
LINE 83: floral catalogue--a species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea
LINE 84: school. Sophia Sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new
LINE 85: pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons. Katie Boulter gave
LINE 86: her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and Julia Bell copied
LINE 87: carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the
LINE 88: following effusion:
LINE 89: "TO ANNE
LINE 90: "When twilight drops her curtain down
LINE 91: And pins it with a star
LINE 92: Remember that you have a friend
LINE 93: Though she may wander far."
LINE 94: "It's so nice to be appreciated," sighed Anne rapturously to Marilla
LINE 95: that night.
LINE 96: The girls were not the only scholars who "appreciated" her. When Anne
LINE 97: went to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by Mr. Phillips to
LINE 98: sit with the model Minnie Andrews--she found on her desk a big luscious
LINE 99: "strawberry apple." Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she
LINE 100: remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew
LINE 101: was in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining
LINE 102: Waters. Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and
LINE 103: ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. The apple lay
LINE 104: untouched on her desk until the next morning, when little Timothy
LINE 105: Andrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one
LINE 106: of his perquisites. Charlie Sloane's slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened
LINE 107: with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary
LINE 108: pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met
LINE 109: with a more favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased to accept
LINE 110: it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated
LINE 111: youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to
LINE 112: make such fearful errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in
LINE 113: after school to rewrite it.
LINE 114: But as,
LINE 115: The CÃ¦sar's pageant shorn of Brutus' bust
LINE 116: Did but of Rome's best son remind her more,
LINE 117: so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who
LINE 118: was sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne's little triumph.
LINE 119: "Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think," she mourned to
LINE 120: Marilla that night. But the next morning a note most fearfully and
LINE 121: wonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to
LINE 122: Anne.
LINE 123: "Dear Anne, ran the former, "Mother says I'm not to play with you or
LINE 124: talk to you even in school. It isn't my fault and don't be cross at
LINE 125: me, because I love you as much as ever. I miss you awfully to tell
LINE 126: all my secrets to and I don't like Gertie Pye one bit. I made you
LINE 127: one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper. They are awfully
LINE 128: fashionable now and only three girls in school know how to make
LINE 129: them. When you look at it remember
LINE 130: Your true friend,
LINE 131: Diana Barry.
LINE 132: Anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply
LINE 133: back to the other side of the school.
LINE 134: My own darling Diana:--
LINE 135: Of course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother.
LINE 136: Our spirits can commune. I shall keep your lovely present forever.
LINE 137: Minnie Andrews is a very nice little girl--although she has no
LINE 138: imagination--but after having been Diana's busum friend I cannot be
LINE 139: Minnie's. Please excuse mistakes because my spelling isn't very good
LINE 140: yet, although much improoved.
LINE 141: Yours until death us do part
LINE 142: Anne or Cordelia Shirley.
LINE 143: P.S. I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight. A. _or_ C.S.
LINE 144: Marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun
LINE 145: to go to school. But none developed. Perhaps Anne caught something of
LINE 146: the "model" spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she got on very well
LINE 147: with Mr. Phillips thenceforth. She flung herself into her studies heart
LINE 148: and soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe.
LINE 149: The rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured
LINE 150: on Gilbert's side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing
LINE 151: cannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for
LINE 152: holding grudges. She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She
LINE 153: would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork,
LINE 154: because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne
LINE 155: persistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated
LINE 156: between them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with
LINE 157: a toss of her long red braids, spelled him down. One morning Gilbert had
LINE 158: all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard
LINE 159: on the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with
LINE 160: decimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they
LINE 161: were ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad
LINE 162: as a take-notice and Anne's mortification was as evident as Gilbert's
LINE 163: satisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month
LINE 164: were held the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out
LINE 165: three marks ahead. The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was
LINE 166: marred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the
LINE 167: whole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had
LINE 168: felt the sting of his defeat.
LINE 169: Mr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly
LINE 170: determined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress
LINE 171: under any kind of teacher. By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were
LINE 172: both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the
LINE 173: elements of "the branches"--by which Latin, geometry, French, and
LINE 174: algebra were meant. In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.
LINE 175: "It's perfectly awful stuff, Marilla," she groaned. "I'm sure I'll never
LINE 176: be able to make head or tail of it. There is no scope for imagination in
LINE 177: it at all. Mr. Phillips says I'm the worst dunce he ever saw at it.
LINE 178: And Gil--I mean some of the others are so smart at it. It is extremely
LINE 179: mortifying, Marilla.
LINE 180: "Even Diana gets along better than I do. But I don't mind being beaten
LINE 181: by Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with
LINE 182: an _inextinguishable_ love. It makes me very sad at times to think about
LINE 183: her. But really, Marilla, one can't stay sad very long in such an
LINE 184: interesting world, can one?"
