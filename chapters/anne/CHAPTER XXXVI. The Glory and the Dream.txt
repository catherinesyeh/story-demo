LINE 1: ON the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be
LINE 2: posted on the bulletin board at Queen's, Anne and Jane walked down the
LINE 3: street together. Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over
LINE 4: and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least; further
LINE 5: considerations troubled Jane not at all; she had no soaring ambitions
LINE 6: and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon. For
LINE 7: we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although
LINE 8: ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but
LINE 9: exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement.
LINE 10: Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had
LINE 11: won the medal and who the Avery. Beyond those ten minutes there did not
LINE 12: seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.
LINE 13: "Of course you'll win one of them anyhow," said Jane, who couldn't
LINE 14: understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise.
LINE 15: "I have not hope of the Avery," said Anne. "Everybody says Emily Clay
LINE 16: will win it. And I'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and
LINE 17: look at it before everybody. I haven't the moral courage. I'm going
LINE 18: straight to the girls' dressing room. You must read the announcements
LINE 19: and then come and tell me, Jane. And I implore you in the name of our
LINE 20: old friendship to do it as quickly as possible. If I have failed just
LINE 21: say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do _don't_
LINE 22: sympathize with me. Promise me this, Jane."
LINE 23: Jane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for
LINE 24: such a promise. When they went up the entrance steps of Queen's they
LINE 25: found the hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on
LINE 26: their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, "Hurrah for
LINE 27: Blythe, Medalist!"
LINE 28: For a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment.
LINE 29: So she had failed and Gilbert had won! Well, Matthew would be sorry--he
LINE 30: had been so sure she would win.
LINE 31: And then!
LINE 32: Somebody called out:
LINE 33: "Three cheers for Miss Shirley, winner of the Avery!"
LINE 34: "Oh, Anne," gasped Jane, as they fled to the girls' dressing room amid
LINE 35: hearty cheers. "Oh, Anne I'm so proud! Isn't it splendid?"
LINE 36: And then the girls were around them and Anne was the center of a
LINE 37: laughing, congratulating group. Her shoulders were thumped and her hands
LINE 38: shaken vigorously. She was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all
LINE 39: she managed to whisper to Jane:
LINE 40: "Oh, won't Matthew and Marilla be pleased! I must write the news home
LINE 41: right away."
LINE 42: Commencement was the next important happening. The exercises were held
LINE 43: in the big assembly hall of the Academy. Addresses were given, essays
LINE 44: read, songs sung, the public award of diplomas, prizes and medals made.
LINE 45: Matthew and Marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student
LINE 46: on the platform--a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed
LINE 47: cheeks and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and
LINE 48: whispered about as the Avery winner.
LINE 49: "Reckon you're glad we kept her, Marilla?" whispered Matthew, speaking
LINE 50: for the first time since he had entered the hall, when Anne had finished
LINE 51: her essay.
LINE 52: "It's not the first time I've been glad," retorted Marilla. "You do like
LINE 53: to rub things in, Matthew Cuthbert."
LINE 54: Miss Barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked
LINE 55: Marilla in the back with her parasol.
LINE 56: "Aren't you proud of that Anne-girl? I am," she said.
LINE 57: Anne went home to Avonlea with Matthew and Marilla that evening. She had
LINE 58: not been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another
LINE 59: day. The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young.
LINE 60: Diana was at Green Gables to meet her. In her own white room, where
LINE 61: Marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked
LINE 62: about her and drew a long breath of happiness.
LINE 63: "Oh, Diana, it's so good to be back again. It's so good to see those
LINE 64: pointed firs coming out against the pink sky--and that white orchard and
LINE 65: the old Snow Queen. Isn't the breath of the mint delicious? And that tea
LINE 66: rose--why, it's a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. And it's _good_
LINE 67: to see you again, Diana!"
LINE 68: "I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me," said
LINE 69: Diana reproachfully. "Josie Pye told me you did. Josie said you were
LINE 70: _infatuated_ with her."
LINE 71: Anne laughed and pelted Diana with the faded "June lilies" of her
LINE 72: bouquet.
LINE 73: "Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are
LINE 74: that one, Diana," she said. "I love you more than ever--and I've so many
LINE 75: things to tell you. But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to sit
LINE 76: here and look at you. I'm tired, I think--tired of being studious and
LINE 77: ambitious. I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the
LINE 78: orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing."
LINE 79: "You've done splendidly, Anne. I suppose you won't be teaching now that
LINE 80: you've won the Avery?"
LINE 81: "No. I'm going to Redmond in September. Doesn't it seem wonderful? I'll
LINE 82: have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three
LINE 83: glorious, golden months of vacation. Jane and Ruby are going to teach.
LINE 84: Isn't it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody Spurgeon and
LINE 85: Josie Pye?"
LINE 86: "The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already," said
LINE 87: Diana. "Gilbert Blythe is going to teach, too. He has to. His father
LINE 88: can't afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means
LINE 89: to earn his own way through. I expect he'll get the school here if Miss
LINE 90: Ames decides to leave."
LINE 91: Anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise. She had not
LINE 92: known this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond
LINE 93: also. What would she do without their inspiring rivalry? Would not
LINE 94: work, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be
LINE 95: rather flat without her friend the enemy?
LINE 96: The next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck Anne that Matthew was
LINE 97: not looking well. Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year
LINE 98: before.
LINE 99: "Marilla," she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, "is Matthew quite
LINE 100: well?"
LINE 101: "No, he isn't," said Marilla in a troubled tone. "He's had some real
LINE 102: bad spells with his heart this spring and he won't spare himself a mite.
LINE 103: I've been real worried about him, but he's some better this while back
LINE 104: and we've got a good hired man, so I'm hoping he'll kind of rest and
LINE 105: pick up. Maybe he will now you're home. You always cheer him up."
LINE 106: Anne leaned across the table and took Marilla's face in her hands.
LINE 107: "You are not looking as well yourself as I'd like to see you, Marilla.
LINE 108: You look tired. I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take
LINE 109: a rest, now that I'm home. I'm just going to take this one day off to
LINE 110: visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will
LINE 111: be your turn to be lazy while I do the work."
LINE 112: Marilla smiled affectionately at her girl.
LINE 113: "It's not the work--it's my head. I've got a pain so often now--behind
LINE 114: my eyes. Doctor Spencer's been fussing with glasses, but they don't do
LINE 115: me any good. There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the
LINE 116: last of June and the doctor says I must see him. I guess I'll have to.
LINE 117: I can't read or sew with any comfort now. Well, Anne, you've done real
LINE 118: well at Queen's I must say. To take First Class License in one year and
LINE 119: win the Avery scholarship--well, well, Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before
LINE 120: a fall and she doesn't believe in the higher education of women at all;
LINE 121: she says it unfits them for woman's true sphere. I don't believe a word
LINE 122: of it. Speaking of Rachel reminds me--did you hear anything about the
LINE 123: Abbey Bank lately, Anne?"
LINE 124: "I heard it was shaky," answered Anne. "Why?"
LINE 125: "That is what Rachel said. She was up here one day last week and said
LINE 126: there was some talk about it. Matthew felt real worried. All we have
LINE 127: saved is in that bank--every penny. I wanted Matthew to put it in the
LINE 128: Savings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of
LINE 129: father's and he'd always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him
LINE 130: at the head of it was good enough for anybody."
LINE 131: "I think he has only been its nominal head for many years," said
LINE 132: Anne. "He is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the
LINE 133: institution."
LINE 134: "Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money
LINE 135: right out and he said he'd think of it. But Mr. Russell told him
LINE 136: yesterday that the bank was all right."
LINE 137: Anne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world. She
LINE 138: never forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free
LINE 139: from shadow and so lavish of blossom. Anne spent some of its rich hours
LINE 140: in the orchard; she went to the Dryad's Bubble and Willowmere and Violet
LINE 141: Vale; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan;
LINE 142: and finally in the evening she went with Matthew for the cows, through
LINE 143: Lovers' Lane to the back pasture. The woods were all gloried through
LINE 144: with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill
LINE 145: gaps in the west. Matthew walked slowly with bent head; Anne, tall and
LINE 146: erect, suited her springing step to his.
LINE 147: "You've been working too hard today, Matthew," she said reproachfully.
LINE 148: "Why won't you take things easier?"
LINE 149: "Well now, I can't seem to," said Matthew, as he opened the yard gate
LINE 150: to let the cows through. "It's only that I'm getting old, Anne, and keep
LINE 151: forgetting it. Well, well, I've always worked pretty hard and I'd rather
LINE 152: drop in harness."
LINE 153: "If I had been the boy you sent for," said Anne wistfully, "I'd be able
LINE 154: to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways. I could find it
LINE 155: in my heart to wish I had been, just for that."
LINE 156: "Well now, I'd rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne," said Matthew
LINE 157: patting her hand. "Just mind you that--rather than a dozen boys. Well
LINE 158: now, I guess it wasn't a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it? It
LINE 159: was a girl--my girl--my girl that I'm proud of."
LINE 160: He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard. Anne took the
LINE 161: memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a
LINE 162: long while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the
LINE 163: future. Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine;
LINE 164: the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope. Anne always
LINE 165: remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night.
LINE 166: It was the last night before sorrow touched her life; and no life is
LINE 167: ever quite the same again when once that cold, sanctifying touch has
LINE 168: been laid upon it.
