LINE 1: OF course you must be Elaine, Anne," said Diana. "I could never have
LINE 2: the courage to float down there."
LINE 3: "Nor I," said Ruby Gillis, with a shiver. "I don't mind floating down
LINE 4: when there's two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up. It's fun
LINE 5: then. But to lie down and pretend I was dead--I just couldn't. I'd die
LINE 6: really of fright."
LINE 7: "Of course it would be romantic," conceded Jane Andrews, "but I know I
LINE 8: couldn't keep still. I'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I
LINE 9: was and if I wasn't drifting too far out. And you know, Anne, that would
LINE 10: spoil the effect."
LINE 11: "But it's so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine," mourned Anne. "I'm
LINE 12: not afraid to float down and I'd love to be Elaine. But it's ridiculous
LINE 13: just the same. Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has
LINE 14: such lovely long golden hair--Elaine had 'all her bright hair streaming
LINE 15: down,' you know. And Elaine was the lily maid. Now, a red-haired person
LINE 16: cannot be a lily maid."
LINE 17: "Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby's," said Diana earnestly, "and
LINE 18: your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it."
LINE 19: "Oh, do you really think so?" exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively with
LINE 20: delight. "I've sometimes thought it was myself--but I never dared to ask
LINE 21: anyone for fear she would tell me it wasn't. Do you think it could be
LINE 22: called auburn now, Diana?"
LINE 23: "Yes, and I think it is real pretty," said Diana, looking admiringly at
LINE 24: the short, silky curls that clustered over Anne's head and were held in
LINE 25: place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow.
LINE 26: They were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where
LINE 27: a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip
LINE 28: was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience
LINE 29: of fishermen and duck hunters. Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer
LINE 30: afternoon with Diana, and Anne had come over to play with them.
LINE 31: Anne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about
LINE 32: the pond. Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly
LINE 33: cut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring.
LINE 34: Anne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the
LINE 35: romance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and
LINE 36: Diana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for
LINE 37: such childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating
LINE 38: sports to be found about the pond. It was splendid to fish for trout
LINE 39: over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the
LINE 40: little flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting.
LINE 41: It was Anne's idea that they dramatize Elaine. They had studied
LINE 42: Tennyson's poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of
LINE 43: Education having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince
LINE 44: Edward Island schools. They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to
LINE 45: pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all
LINE 46: left in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and
LINE 47: Guinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne
LINE 48: was devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot.
LINE 49: Those days, she said, were so much more romantic than the present.
LINE 50: Anne's plan was hailed with enthusiasm. The girls had discovered that if
LINE 51: the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down
LINE 52: with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another
LINE 53: headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often
LINE 54: gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing
LINE 55: Elaine.
LINE 56: "Well, I'll be Elaine," said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although
LINE 57: she would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet
LINE 58: her artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her
LINE 59: limitations made impossible. "Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane
LINE 60: will be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot. But first you must be the
LINE 61: brothers and the father. We can't have the old dumb servitor because
LINE 62: there isn't room for two in the flat when one is lying down. We must
LINE 63: pall the barge all its length in blackest samite. That old black shawl
LINE 64: of your mother's will be just the thing, Diana."
LINE 65: The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and
LINE 66: then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her
LINE 67: breast.
LINE 68: "Oh, she does look really dead," whispered Ruby Gillis nervously,
LINE 69: watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of
LINE 70: the birches. "It makes me feel frightened, girls. Do you suppose it's
LINE 71: really right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is
LINE 72: abominably wicked."
LINE 73: "Ruby, you shouldn't talk about Mrs. Lynde," said Anne severely. "It
LINE 74: spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde
LINE 75: was born. Jane, you arrange this. It's silly for Elaine to be talking
LINE 76: when she's dead."
LINE 77: Jane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none,
LINE 78: but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent
LINE 79: substitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of
LINE 80: a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne's folded hands was all that could
LINE 81: be desired.
LINE 82: "Now, she's all ready," said Jane. "We must kiss her quiet brows
LINE 83: and, Diana, you say, 'Sister, farewell forever,' and Ruby, you say,
LINE 84: 'Farewell, sweet sister,' both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly
LINE 85: can. Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine 'lay as
LINE 86: though she smiled.' That's better. Now push the flat off."
LINE 87: The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old
LINE 88: embedded stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long
LINE 89: enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before
LINE 90: scampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower
LINE 91: headland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be
LINE 92: in readiness to receive the lily maid.
LINE 93: For a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her
LINE 94: situation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The
LINE 95: flat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine
LINE 96: to scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall
LINE 97: of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her
LINE 98: barge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at
LINE 99: the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne
LINE 100: did not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was
LINE 101: in a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long
LINE 102: before it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left
LINE 103: behind at the landing!
LINE 104: Anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was
LINE 105: white to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. There was
LINE 106: one chance--just one.
LINE 107: "I was horribly frightened," she told Mrs. Allan the next day, "and it
LINE 108: seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the
LINE 109: water rising in it every moment. I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly,
LINE 110: but I didn't shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could
LINE 111: save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge
LINE 112: piles for me to climb up on it. You know the piles are just old tree
LINE 113: trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. It was
LINE 114: proper to pray, but I had to do my part by watching out and right well
LINE 115: I knew it. I just said, 'Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile
LINE 116: and I'll do the rest,' over and over again. Under such circumstances you
LINE 117: don't think much about making a flowery prayer. But mine was answered,
LINE 118: for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf
LINE 119: and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential
LINE 120: stub. And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile
LINE 121: with no way of getting up or down. It was a very unromantic position,
LINE 122: but I didn't think about that at the time. You don't think much about
LINE 123: romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave. I said a
LINE 124: grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on
LINE 125: tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get
LINE 126: back to dry land."
LINE 127: The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream.
LINE 128: Ruby, Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it
LINE 129: disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne
LINE 130: had gone down with it. For a moment they stood still, white as sheets,
LINE 131: frozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of
LINE 132: their voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never
LINE 133: pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge.
LINE 134: Anne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying
LINE 135: forms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her
LINE 136: position was a very uncomfortable one.
LINE 137: The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily
LINE 138: maid. Why didn't somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they
LINE 139: had fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so
LINE 140: tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the
LINE 141: wicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and
LINE 142: shivered. Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome
LINE 143: possibilities to her.
LINE 144: Then, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her
LINE 145: arms and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the
LINE 146: bridge in Harmon Andrews's dory!
LINE 147: Gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white
LINE 148: scornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also
LINE 149: scornful gray eyes.
LINE 150: "Anne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?" he exclaimed.
LINE 151: Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended
LINE 152: his hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe's
LINE 153: hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious,
LINE 154: in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was
LINE 155: certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!
LINE 156: "What has happened, Anne?" asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.
LINE 157: "We were playing Elaine," explained Anne frigidly, without even looking
LINE 158: at her rescuer, "and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge--I
LINE 159: mean the flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile.
LINE 160: The girls went for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the
LINE 161: landing?"
LINE 162: Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance,
LINE 163: sprang nimbly on shore.
LINE 164: "I'm very much obliged to you," she said haughtily as she turned away.
LINE 165: But Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand
LINE 166: on her arm.
LINE 167: "Anne," he said hurriedly, "look here. Can't we be good friends? I'm
LINE 168: awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn't mean to vex
LINE 169: you and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it's so long ago. I think
LINE 170: your hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends."
LINE 171: For a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened
LINE 172: consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy,
LINE 173: half-eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was
LINE 174: very good to see. Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the
LINE 175: bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering
LINE 176: determination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her
LINE 177: recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had
LINE 178: called her "carrots" and had brought about her disgrace before the whole
LINE 179: school. Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as
LINE 180: laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time
LINE 181: seemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!
LINE 182: "No," she said coldly, "I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert
LINE 183: Blythe; and I don't want to be!"
LINE 184: "All right!" Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his
LINE 185: cheeks. "I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I
LINE 186: don't care either!"
LINE 187: He pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep,
LINE 188: ferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but
LINE 189: she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had
LINE 190: answered Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly,
LINE 191: but still--! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to
LINE 192: sit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the
LINE 193: reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.
LINE 194: Halfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in
LINE 195: a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at
LINE 196: Orchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had
LINE 197: succumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she
LINE 198: might, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the
LINE 199: brook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla
LINE 200: had gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.
LINE 201: "Oh, Anne," gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former's neck
LINE 202: and weeping with relief and delight, "oh, Anne--we thought--you
LINE 203: were--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you
LINE 204: be--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?"
LINE 205: "I climbed up on one of the piles," explained Anne wearily, "and Gilbert
LINE 206: Blythe came along in Mr. Andrews's dory and brought me to land."
LINE 207: "Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it's so romantic!" said Jane,
LINE 208: finding breath enough for utterance at last. "Of course you'll speak to
LINE 209: him after this."
LINE 210: "Of course I won't," flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old
LINE 211: spirit. "And I don't want ever to hear the word 'romantic' again, Jane
LINE 212: Andrews. I'm awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my
LINE 213: fault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do
LINE 214: gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your
LINE 215: father's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be
LINE 216: allowed to row on the pond any more."
LINE 217: Anne's presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt
LINE 218: to do. Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households
LINE 219: when the events of the afternoon became known.
LINE 220: "Will you ever have any sense, Anne?" groaned Marilla.
LINE 221: "Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla," returned Anne optimistically. A good
LINE 222: cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed
LINE 223: her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness. "I think my
LINE 224: prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever."
LINE 225: "I don't see how," said Marilla.
LINE 226: "Well," explained Anne, "I've learned a new and valuable lesson today.
LINE 227: Ever since I came to Green Gables I've been making mistakes, and each
LINE 228: mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of
LINE 229: the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong
LINE 230: to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run
LINE 231: away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in
LINE 232: cooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair
LINE 233: and nose now--at least, very seldom. And today's mistake is going to
LINE 234: cure me of being too romantic. I have come to the conclusion that it is
LINE 235: no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in
LINE 236: towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated
LINE 237: now. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me
LINE 238: in this respect, Marilla."
LINE 239: "I'm sure I hope so," said Marilla skeptically.
LINE 240: But Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on
LINE 241: Anne's shoulder when Marilla had gone out.
LINE 242: "Don't give up all your romance, Anne," he whispered shyly, "a little
LINE 243: of it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it,
LINE 244: Anne, keep a little of it."
