LINE 1: IT was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring
LINE 2: confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was
LINE 3: pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across
LINE 4: glimpses of blue sky.
LINE 5: For a moment she could not remember where she was. First came a
LINE 6: delightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible
LINE 7: remembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want her because she
LINE 8: wasn't a boy!
LINE 9: But it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside
LINE 10: of her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.
LINE 11: She pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn't
LINE 12: been opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight
LINE 13: that nothing was needed to hold it up.
LINE 14: Anne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes
LINE 15: glistening with delight. Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely
LINE 16: place? Suppose she wasn't really going to stay here! She would imagine
LINE 17: she was. There was scope for imagination here.
LINE 18: A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against
LINE 19: the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf
LINE 20: was to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of
LINE 21: apple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;
LINE 22: and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below
LINE 23: were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance
LINE 24: drifted up to the window on the morning wind.
LINE 25: Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the
LINE 26: hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,
LINE 27: upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful
LINE 28: possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it
LINE 29: was a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in
LINE 30: it where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the
LINE 31: other side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.
LINE 32: Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over
LINE 33: green, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.
LINE 34: Anne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily
LINE 35: in. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;
LINE 36: but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.
LINE 37: She knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until
LINE 38: she was startled by a hand on her shoulder. Marilla had come in unheard
LINE 39: by the small dreamer.
LINE 40: "It's time you were dressed," she said curtly.
LINE 41: Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her
LINE 42: uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to
LINE 43: be.
LINE 44: Anne stood up and drew a long breath.
LINE 45: "Oh, isn't it wonderful?" she said, waving her hand comprehensively at
LINE 46: the good world outside.
LINE 47: "It's a big tree," said Marilla, "and it blooms great, but the fruit
LINE 48: don't amount to much never--small and wormy."
LINE 49: "Oh, I don't mean just the tree; of course it's lovely--yes, it's
LINE 50: _radiantly_ lovely--it blooms as if it meant it--but I meant everything,
LINE 51: the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big
LINE 52: dear world. Don't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning
LINE 53: like this? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here.
LINE 54: Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are? They're always
LINE 55: laughing. Even in winter-time I've heard them under the ice. I'm so glad
LINE 56: there's a brook near Green Gables. Perhaps you think it doesn't make any
LINE 57: difference to me when you're not going to keep me, but it does. I shall
LINE 58: always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if
LINE 59: I never see it again. If there wasn't a brook I'd be _haunted_ by the
LINE 60: uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one. I'm not in the depths
LINE 61: of despair this morning. I never can be in the morning. Isn't it a
LINE 62: splendid thing that there are mornings? But I feel very sad. I've just
LINE 63: been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was
LINE 64: to stay here for ever and ever. It was a great comfort while it lasted.
LINE 65: But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have
LINE 66: to stop and that hurts."
LINE 67: "You'd better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your
LINE 68: imaginings," said Marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.
LINE 69: "Breakfast is waiting. Wash your face and comb your hair. Leave the
LINE 70: window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed. Be as
LINE 71: smart as you can."
LINE 72: Anne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs
LINE 73: in ten minutes' time, with her clothes neatly on, her hair brushed and
LINE 74: braided, her face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her
LINE 75: soul that she had fulfilled all Marilla's requirements. As a matter of
LINE 76: fact, however, she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.
LINE 77: "I'm pretty hungry this morning," she announced as she slipped into the
LINE 78: chair Marilla placed for her. "The world doesn't seem such a howling
LINE 79: wilderness as it did last night. I'm so glad it's a sunshiny morning.
LINE 80: But I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are
LINE 81: interesting, don't you think? You don't know what's going to happen
LINE 82: through the day, and there's so much scope for imagination. But I'm
LINE 83: glad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear
LINE 84: up under affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal
LINE 85: to bear up under. It's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine
LINE 86: yourself living through them heroically, but it's not so nice when you
LINE 87: really come to have them, is it?"
LINE 88: "For pity's sake hold your tongue," said Marilla. "You talk entirely too
LINE 89: much for a little girl."
LINE 90: Thereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her
LINE 91: continued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of
LINE 92: something not exactly natural. Matthew also held his tongue,--but this
LINE 93: was natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one.
LINE 94: As it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating
LINE 95: mechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the
LINE 96: sky outside the window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she
LINE 97: had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might
LINE 98: be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy
LINE 99: cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination. Who would want such
LINE 100: a child about the place?
LINE 101: Yet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things! Marilla
LINE 102: felt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night
LINE 103: before, and that he would go on wanting it. That was Matthew's way--take
LINE 104: a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent
LINE 105: persistency--a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its
LINE 106: very silence than if he had talked it out.
LINE 107: When the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash
LINE 108: the dishes.
LINE 109: "Can you wash dishes right?" asked Marilla distrustfully.
LINE 110: "Pretty well. I'm better at looking after children, though. I've had so
LINE 111: much experience at that. It's such a pity you haven't any here for me to
LINE 112: look after."
LINE 113: "I don't feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I've
LINE 114: got at present. _You're_ problem enough in all conscience. What's to be
LINE 115: done with you I don't know. Matthew is a most ridiculous man."
LINE 116: "I think he's lovely," said Anne reproachfully. "He is so very
LINE 117: sympathetic. He didn't mind how much I talked--he seemed to like it. I
LINE 118: felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him."
LINE 119: "You're both queer enough, if that's what you mean by kindred spirits,"
LINE 120: said Marilla with a sniff. "Yes, you may wash the dishes. Take plenty of
LINE 121: hot water, and be sure you dry them well. I've got enough to attend to
LINE 122: this morning for I'll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon
LINE 123: and see Mrs. Spencer. You'll come with me and we'll settle what's to be
LINE 124: done with you. After you've finished the dishes go up-stairs and make
LINE 125: your bed."
LINE 126: Anne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla who kept a sharp eye on
LINE 127: the process, discerned. Later on she made her bed less successfully, for
LINE 128: she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. But is
LINE 129: was done somehow and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her,
LINE 130: told her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time.
LINE 131: Anne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing. On the very threshold
LINE 132: she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table,
LINE 133: light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an
LINE 134: extinguisher on her.
LINE 135: "What's the matter now?" demanded Marilla.
LINE 136: "I don't dare go out," said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing
LINE 137: all earthly joys. "If I can't stay here there is no use in my loving
LINE 138: Green Gables. And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those
LINE 139: trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I'll not be able to help
LINE 140: loving it. It's hard enough now, so I won't make it any harder. I want
LINE 141: to go out so much--everything seems to be calling to me, 'Anne, Anne,
LINE 142: come out to us. Anne, Anne, we want a playmate'--but it's better not.
LINE 143: There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is
LINE 144: there? And it's so hard to keep from loving things, isn't it? That was
LINE 145: why I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here. I thought
LINE 146: I'd have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me. But that brief
LINE 147: dream is over. I am resigned to my fate now, so I don't think I'll
LINE 148: go out for fear I'll get unresigned again. What is the name of that
LINE 149: geranium on the window-sill, please?"
LINE 150: "That's the apple-scented geranium."
LINE 151: "Oh, I don't mean that sort of a name. I mean just a name you gave it
LINE 152: yourself. Didn't you give it a name? May I give it one then? May I call
LINE 153: it--let me see--Bonny would do--may I call it Bonny while I'm here? Oh,
LINE 154: do let me!"
LINE 155: "Goodness, I don't care. But where on earth is the sense of naming a
LINE 156: geranium?"
LINE 157: "Oh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums. It
LINE 158: makes them seem more like people. How do you know but that it hurts a
LINE 159: geranium's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else? You
LINE 160: wouldn't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time. Yes, I
LINE 161: shall call it Bonny. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window
LINE 162: this morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white. Of course,
LINE 163: it won't always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can't
LINE 164: one?"
LINE 165: "I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her," muttered
LINE 166: Marilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes. "She
LINE 167: is kind of interesting as Matthew says. I can feel already that I'm
LINE 168: wondering what on earth she'll say next. She'll be casting a spell over
LINE 169: me, too. She's cast it over Matthew. That look he gave me when he went
LINE 170: out said everything he said or hinted last night over again. I wish he
LINE 171: was like other men and would talk things out. A body could answer back
LINE 172: then and argue him into reason. But what's to be done with a man who
LINE 173: just _looks?_"
LINE 174: Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes
LINE 175: on the sky, when Marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage. There
LINE 176: Marilla left her until the early dinner was on the table.
LINE 177: "I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?" said
LINE 178: Marilla.
LINE 179: Matthew nodded and looked wistfully at Anne. Marilla intercepted the
LINE 180: look and said grimly:
LINE 181: "I'm going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing. I'll take
LINE 182: Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send
LINE 183: her back to Nova Scotia at once. I'll set your tea out for you and I'll
LINE 184: be home in time to milk the cows."
LINE 185: Still Matthew said nothing and Marilla had a sense of having wasted
LINE 186: words and breath. There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won't
LINE 187: talk back--unless it is a woman who won't.
LINE 188: Matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and Marilla and
LINE 189: Anne set off. Matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove
LINE 190: slowly through, he said, to nobody in particular as it seemed:
LINE 191: "Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning, and I told him
LINE 192: I guessed I'd hire him for the summer."
LINE 193: Marilla made no reply, but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious
LINE 194: clip with the whip that the fat mare, unused to such treatment, whizzed
LINE 195: indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace. Marilla looked back once
LINE 196: as the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating Matthew leaning over
LINE 197: the gate, looking wistfully after them.
