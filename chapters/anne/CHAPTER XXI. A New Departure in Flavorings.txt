LINE 1: DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as
LINE 2: Mrs. Lynde says," remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books
LINE 3: down on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red
LINE 4: eyes with a very damp handkerchief. "Wasn't it fortunate, Marilla, that
LINE 5: I took an extra handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that
LINE 6: it would be needed."
LINE 7: "I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you'd require two
LINE 8: handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away," said
LINE 9: Marilla.
LINE 10: "I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,"
LINE 11: reflected Anne. "I just cried because all the others did. It was
LINE 12: Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr.
LINE 13: Phillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she
LINE 14: burst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.
LINE 15: I tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips
LINE 16: made me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name
LINE 17: without an 'e' on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce
LINE 18: he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he
LINE 19: had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I
LINE 20: just had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how
LINE 21: glad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never
LINE 22: shed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a
LINE 23: handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because
LINE 24: she hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,
LINE 25: Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful
LINE 26: farewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was
LINE 27: very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt
LINE 28: dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school
LINE 29: and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.
LINE 30: I can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She
LINE 31: hadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from
LINE 32: school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come
LINE 33: for us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in
LINE 34: any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one
LINE 35: can't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation
LINE 36: before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and
LINE 37: his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.
LINE 38: Phillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new
LINE 39: minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,
LINE 40: of course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally
LINE 41: lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the
LINE 42: minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she
LINE 43: dresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue
LINE 44: muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.
LINE 45: Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for
LINE 46: a minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark,
LINE 47: Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,
LINE 48: she's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should
LINE 49: make allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde
LINE 50: until the manse is ready."
LINE 51: If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by
LINE 52: any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had
LINE 53: borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most
LINE 54: of the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes
LINE 55: never expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the
LINE 56: borrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,
LINE 57: was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement
LINE 58: where sensations were few and far between.
LINE 59: Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in
LINE 60: imagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a
LINE 61: widower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that
LINE 62: gossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year
LINE 63: of his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and
LINE 64: departed amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection
LINE 65: born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his
LINE 66: shortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a
LINE 67: variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various
LINE 68: candidates and "supplies" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on
LINE 69: trial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers
LINE 70: in Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the
LINE 71: corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and
LINE 72: discussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from
LINE 73: principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form.
LINE 74: "I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew" was Anne's final
LINE 75: summing up. "Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his
LINE 76: worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he had no imagination. And Mr.
LINE 77: Terry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in
LINE 78: the matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology
LINE 79: wasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,
LINE 80: but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;
LINE 81: he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,
LINE 82: mustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;
LINE 83: but Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made
LINE 84: special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have
LINE 85: a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the
LINE 86: congregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing
LINE 87: woman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I
LINE 88: liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he
LINE 89: meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.
LINE 90: Mrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't
LINE 91: expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,
LINE 92: and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly
LINE 93: on all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife's people and they
LINE 94: are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde
LINE 95: says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman
LINE 96: make an ideal combination for a minister's family."
LINE 97: The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still
LINE 98: on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for
LINE 99: their chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.
LINE 100: Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,
LINE 101: and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the
LINE 102: manse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.
LINE 103: She had discovered another kindred spirit.
LINE 104: "Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely," she announced one Sunday afternoon.
LINE 105: "She's taken our class and she's a splendid teacher. She said right away
LINE 106: she didn't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,
LINE 107: and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I've always thought. She
LINE 108: said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.
LINE 109: I'm good at asking questions, Marilla."
LINE 110: "I believe you," was Marilla's emphatic comment.
LINE 111: "Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was
LINE 112: to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a
LINE 113: very proper question to ask because it hadn't any connection with the
LINE 114: lesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan
LINE 115: just smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a
LINE 116: lovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had
LINE 117: dimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I
LINE 118: came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence
LINE 119: people for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence
LINE 120: other people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew
LINE 121: before that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it
LINE 122: was kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a
LINE 123: Christian if I could be one like her. I wouldn't want to be one like Mr.
LINE 124: Superintendent Bell."
LINE 125: "It's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell," said Marilla
LINE 126: severely. "Mr. Bell is a real good man."
LINE 127: "Oh, of course he's good," agreed Anne, "but he doesn't seem to get any
LINE 128: comfort out of it. If I could be good I'd dance and sing all day because
LINE 129: I was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and
LINE 130: of course it wouldn't be dignified in a minister's wife. But I can just
LINE 131: feel she's glad she's a Christian and that she'd be one even if she
LINE 132: could get to heaven without it."
LINE 133: "I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon," said
LINE 134: Marilla reflectively. "They've been most everywhere but here. Let me
LINE 135: see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a
LINE 136: word to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he'd find some
LINE 137: excuse to be away that day. He'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn't
LINE 138: mind him, but he's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new
LINE 139: minister, and a new minister's wife will frighten him to death."
LINE 140: "I'll be as secret as the dead," assured Anne. "But oh, Marilla, will
LINE 141: you let me make a cake for the occasion? I'd love to do something for
LINE 142: Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time."
LINE 143: "You can make a layer cake," promised Marilla.
LINE 144: Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.
LINE 145: Having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important
LINE 146: undertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of
LINE 147: the Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She
LINE 148: talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they
LINE 149: sat on the big red stones by the Dryad's Bubble and made rainbows in the
LINE 150: water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.
LINE 151: "Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I'm to make in the
LINE 152: morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just
LINE 153: before teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy
LINE 154: two days of it. It's such a responsibility having a minister's family to
LINE 155: tea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see
LINE 156: our pantry. It's a sight to behold. We're going to have jellied chicken
LINE 157: and cold tongue. We're to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and
LINE 158: whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,
LINE 159: and fruit cake, and Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves that she
LINE 160: keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and
LINE 161: biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister
LINE 162: is dyspeptic and can't eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic,
LINE 163: but I don't think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to
LINE 164: have had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer
LINE 165: cake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn't be good! I dreamed last night that
LINE 166: I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a
LINE 167: head."
LINE 168: "It'll be good, all right," assured Diana, who was a very comfortable
LINE 169: sort of friend. "I'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for
LINE 170: lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant."
LINE 171: "Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just
LINE 172: when you especially want them to be good," sighed Anne, setting a
LINE 173: particularly well-balsamed twig afloat. "However, I suppose I shall
LINE 174: just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh,
LINE 175: look, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come
LINE 176: out after we go away and take it for a scarf?"
LINE 177: "You know there is no such thing as a dryad," said Diana. Diana's mother
LINE 178: had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over
LINE 179: it. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights
LINE 180: of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of
LINE 181: belief even in harmless dryads.
LINE 182: "But it's so easy to imagine there is," said Anne. "Every night before
LINE 183: I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really
LINE 184: sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes
LINE 185: I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't
LINE 186: give up your faith in the dryad!"
LINE 187: Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too
LINE 188: excited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of
LINE 189: her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short
LINE 190: of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary
LINE 191: matters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.
LINE 192: When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.
LINE 193: "I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you
LINE 194: think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I
LINE 195: used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of
LINE 196: getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.
LINE 197: Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says
LINE 198: we'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what
LINE 199: if that cake doesn't rise?"
LINE 200: "We'll have plenty without it" was Marilla's unimpassioned way of
LINE 201: looking at the subject.
LINE 202: The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and
LINE 203: feathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together
LINE 204: with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it
LINE 205: and possibly asking for another piece!
LINE 206: "You'll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla," she said. "Can I
LINE 207: fix the table with ferns and wild roses?"
LINE 208: "I think that's all nonsense," sniffed Marilla. "In my opinion it's the
LINE 209: eatables that matter and not flummery decorations."
LINE 210: "Mrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated," said Anne, who was not entirely
LINE 211: guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, "and the minister paid her an
LINE 212: elegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the
LINE 213: palate."
LINE 214: "Well, do as you like," said Marilla, who was quite determined not to
LINE 215: be surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. "Only mind you leave enough
LINE 216: room for the dishes and the food."
LINE 217: Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that
LINE 218: should leave Mrs. Barry's nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns
LINE 219: and a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a
LINE 220: thing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they
LINE 221: exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.
LINE 222: "It's Anne's doings," said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.
LINE 223: Allan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.
LINE 224: Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness
LINE 225: and Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and
LINE 226: nervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him
LINE 227: in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes
LINE 228: and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.
LINE 229: He never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be
LINE 230: expected.
LINE 231: All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed.
LINE 232: Mrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,
LINE 233: declined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne's face, said
LINE 234: smilingly:
LINE 235: "Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose
LINE 236: for you."
LINE 237: "In that case I must sample it," laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to
LINE 238: a plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.
LINE 239: Mrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression
LINE 240: crossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away
LINE 241: at it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.
LINE 242: "Anne Shirley!" she exclaimed, "what on earth did you put into that
LINE 243: cake?"
LINE 244: "Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla," cried Anne with a look of
LINE 245: anguish. "Oh, isn't it all right?"
LINE 246: "All right! It's simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don't try to eat it. Anne,
LINE 247: taste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?"
LINE 248: "Vanilla," said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting
LINE 249: the cake. "Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking
LINE 250: powder. I had my suspicions of that bak--"
LINE 251: "Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you
LINE 252: used."
LINE 253: Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially
LINE 254: filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, "Best Vanilla."
LINE 255: Marilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.
LINE 256: "Mercy on us, Anne, you've flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I
LINE 257: broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an
LINE 258: old empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have
LINE 259: warned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?"
LINE 260: Anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.
LINE 261: "I couldn't--I had such a cold!" and with this she fairly fled to the
LINE 262: gable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who
LINE 263: refuses to be comforted.
LINE 264: Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the
LINE 265: room.
LINE 266: "Oh, Marilla," sobbed Anne, without looking up, "I'm disgraced forever.
LINE 267: I shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always
LINE 268: do get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I
LINE 269: shall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the
LINE 270: girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school
LINE 271: will never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark
LINE 272: of Christian pity don't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes
LINE 273: after this. I'll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but
LINE 274: I cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she'll think I
LINE 275: tried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried
LINE 276: to poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn't poisonous. It's meant
LINE 277: to be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won't you tell Mrs. Allan
LINE 278: so, Marilla?"
LINE 279: "Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself," said a merry voice.
LINE 280: Anne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with
LINE 281: laughing eyes.
LINE 282: "My dear little girl, you mustn't cry like this," she said, genuinely
LINE 283: disturbed by Anne's tragic face. "Why, it's all just a funny mistake
LINE 284: that anybody might make."
LINE 285: "Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake," said Anne forlornly. "And
LINE 286: I wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan."
LINE 287: "Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and
LINE 288: thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now,
LINE 289: you mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower
LINE 290: garden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I
LINE 291: want to see it, for I'm very much interested in flowers."
LINE 292: Anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it
LINE 293: was really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing
LINE 294: more was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away
LINE 295: Anne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been
LINE 296: expected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed
LINE 297: deeply.
LINE 298: "Marilla, isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no
LINE 299: mistakes in it yet?"
LINE 300: "I'll warrant you'll make plenty in it," said Marilla. "I never saw your
LINE 301: beat for making mistakes, Anne."
LINE 302: "Yes, and well I know it," admitted Anne mournfully. "But have you ever
LINE 303: noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same
LINE 304: mistake twice."
LINE 305: "I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new
LINE 306: ones."
LINE 307: "Oh, don't you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one
LINE 308: person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through
LINE 309: with them. That's a very comforting thought."
LINE 310: "Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs," said Marilla.
LINE 311: "It isn't fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry Boute."
