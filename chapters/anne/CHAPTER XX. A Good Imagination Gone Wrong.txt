LINE 1: SPRING had come once more to Green Gables--the beautiful capricious,
LINE 2: reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a
LINE 3: succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles
LINE 4: of resurrection and growth. The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded
LINE 5: and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in
LINE 6: the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed
LINE 7: out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the
LINE 8: school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming
LINE 9: home in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of
LINE 10: flowery spoil.
LINE 11: "I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no
LINE 12: Mayflowers," said Anne. "Diana says perhaps they have something better,
LINE 13: but there couldn't be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,
LINE 14: Marilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't
LINE 15: miss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it
LINE 16: would be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_
LINE 17: to miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think
LINE 18: they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this
LINE 19: is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our
LINE 20: lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.
LINE 21: Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because
LINE 22: he wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_
LINE 23: to dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews
LINE 24: and I heard him to say 'sweets to the sweet.' He got that out of a
LINE 25: book, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some
LINE 26: Mayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the
LINE 27: person's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We
LINE 28: made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the
LINE 29: time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,
LINE 30: with our bouquets and wreaths, singing 'My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was
LINE 31: so thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us
LINE 32: and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a
LINE 33: real sensation."
LINE 34: "Not much wonder! Such silly doings!" was Marilla's response.
LINE 35: After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled
LINE 36: with them. Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent
LINE 37: steps and worshiping eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.
LINE 38: "Somehow," she told Diana, "when I'm going through here I don't really
LINE 39: care whether Gil--whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not. But
LINE 40: when I'm up in school it's all different and I care as much as ever.
LINE 41: There's such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is
LINE 42: why I'm such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would
LINE 43: be ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn't be half so
LINE 44: interesting."
LINE 45: One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the
LINE 46: frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the
LINE 47: Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover
LINE 48: fields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window.
LINE 49: She had been studying her lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the
LINE 50: book, so she had fallen into wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the
LINE 51: boughs of the Snow Queen, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom.
LINE 52: In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged. The
LINE 53: walls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly
LINE 54: and yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was
LINE 55: altered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to
LINE 56: pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses
LINE 57: and ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms
LINE 58: on the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its
LINE 59: vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had
LINE 60: tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and
LINE 61: moonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne's freshly
LINE 62: ironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with
LINE 63: a short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and
LINE 64: although the pain had gone she felt weak and "tuckered out," as she
LINE 65: expressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.
LINE 66: "I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I
LINE 67: would have endured it joyfully for your sake."
LINE 68: "I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me
LINE 69: rest," said Marilla. "You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer
LINE 70: mistakes than usual. Of course it wasn't exactly necessary to starch
LINE 71: Matthew's handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven
LINE 72: to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of
LINE 73: leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way
LINE 74: evidently."
LINE 75: Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.
LINE 76: "Oh, I'm so sorry," said Anne penitently. "I never thought about that
LINE 77: pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt
LINE 78: _instinctively_ that there was something missing on the dinner table. I
LINE 79: was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to
LINE 80: imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until
LINE 81: I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to
LINE 82: imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a
LINE 83: handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that
LINE 84: is how I came to forget the pie. I didn't know I starched the
LINE 85: handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a
LINE 86: name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It's the
LINE 87: most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the
LINE 88: brook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be
LINE 89: splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen's
LINE 90: birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I'm sorry about that pie
LINE 91: and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it's an
LINE 92: anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?"
LINE 93: "No, I can't think of anything special."
LINE 94: "Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never
LINE 95: forget it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn't
LINE 96: seem so important to you. I've been here for a year and I've been so
LINE 97: happy. Of course, I've had my troubles, but one can live down troubles.
LINE 98: Are you sorry you kept me, Marilla?"
LINE 99: "No, I can't say I'm sorry," said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how
LINE 100: she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, "no, not exactly
LINE 101: sorry. If you've finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and
LINE 102: ask Mrs. Barry if she'll lend me Diana's apron pattern."
LINE 103: "Oh--it's--it's too dark," cried Anne.
LINE 104: "Too dark? Why, it's only twilight. And goodness knows you've gone over
LINE 105: often enough after dark."
LINE 106: "I'll go over early in the morning," said Anne eagerly. "I'll get up at
LINE 107: sunrise and go over, Marilla."
LINE 108: "What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to
LINE 109: cut out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too."
LINE 110: "I'll have to go around by the road, then," said Anne, taking up her hat
LINE 111: reluctantly.
LINE 112: "Go by the road and waste half an hour! I'd like to catch you!"
LINE 113: "I can't go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla," cried Anne desperately.
LINE 114: Marilla stared.
LINE 115: "The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted
LINE 116: Wood?"
LINE 117: "The spruce wood over the brook," said Anne in a whisper.
LINE 118: "Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who
LINE 119: has been telling you such stuff?"
LINE 120: "Nobody," confessed Anne. "Diana and I just imagined the wood was
LINE 121: haunted. All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_. We just got
LINE 122: this up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is
LINE 123: so very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it's so
LINE 124: gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There's a white
LINE 125: lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings
LINE 126: her hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a
LINE 127: death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the
LINE 128: corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers
LINE 129: on your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And
LINE 130: there's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower
LINE 131: at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn't go through the
LINE 132: Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. I'd be sure that white things
LINE 133: would reach out from behind the trees and grab me."
LINE 134: "Did ever anyone hear the like!" ejaculated Marilla, who had
LINE 135: listened in dumb amazement. "Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you
LINE 136: believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?"
LINE 137: "Not believe _exactly_," faltered Anne. "At least, I don't believe it in
LINE 138: daylight. But after dark, Marilla, it's different. That is when ghosts
LINE 139: walk."
LINE 140: "There are no such things as ghosts, Anne."
LINE 141: "Oh, but there are, Marilla," cried Anne eagerly. "I know people who
LINE 142: have seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says
LINE 143: that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night
LINE 144: after he'd been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane's grandmother
LINE 145: wouldn't tell a story for anything. She's a very religious woman. And
LINE 146: Mrs. Thomas's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with
LINE 147: its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the
LINE 148: spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine
LINE 149: days. He didn't, but he died two years after, so you see it was really
LINE 150: true. And Ruby Gillis says--"
LINE 151: "Anne Shirley," interrupted Marilla firmly, "I never want to hear you
LINE 152: talking in this fashion again. I've had my doubts about that imagination
LINE 153: of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I
LINE 154: won't countenance any such doings. You'll go right over to Barry's, and
LINE 155: you'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to
LINE 156: you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods
LINE 157: again."
LINE 158: Anne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very
LINE 159: real. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce
LINE 160: grove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She
LINE 161: marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her
LINE 162: to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of
LINE 163: wailing ladies and headless specters beyond.
LINE 164: "Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?" sobbed Anne. "What would you
LINE 165: feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?"
LINE 166: "I'll risk it," said Marilla unfeelingly. "You know I always mean what I
LINE 167: say. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now."
LINE 168: Anne marched. That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering
LINE 169: up the horrible dim path beyond. Anne never forgot that walk. Bitterly
LINE 170: did she repent the license she had given to her imagination. The goblins
LINE 171: of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold,
LINE 172: fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them
LINE 173: into being. A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over
LINE 174: the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still. The long-drawn
LINE 175: wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the
LINE 176: perspiration in beads on her forehead. The swoop of bats in the darkness
LINE 177: over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures. When she reached Mr.
LINE 178: William Bell's field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of
LINE 179: white things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath
LINE 180: that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern.
LINE 181: Diana was away so that she had no excuse to linger. The dreadful
LINE 182: return journey had to be faced. Anne went back over it with shut eyes,
LINE 183: preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs
LINE 184: to that of seeing a white thing. When she finally stumbled over the log
LINE 185: bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief.
LINE 186: "Well, so nothing caught you?" said Marilla unsympathetically.
LINE 187: "Oh, Mar--Marilla," chattered Anne, "I'll b-b-be contt-tented with
LINE 188: c-c-commonplace places after this."
LINE 189: CHAPTER XXI. A New Departure in Flavorings
LINE 190: DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as
LINE 191: Mrs. Lynde says," remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books
LINE 192: down on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red
LINE 193: eyes with a very damp handkerchief. "Wasn't it fortunate, Marilla, that
LINE 194: I took an extra handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that
LINE 195: it would be needed."
LINE 196: "I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you'd require two
LINE 197: handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away," said
LINE 198: Marilla.
LINE 199: "I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,"
LINE 200: reflected Anne. "I just cried because all the others did. It was
LINE 201: Ruby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr.
LINE 202: Phillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she
LINE 203: burst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.
LINE 204: I tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips
LINE 205: made me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name
LINE 206: without an 'e' on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce
LINE 207: he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he
LINE 208: had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I
LINE 209: just had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how
LINE 210: glad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never
LINE 211: shed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a
LINE 212: handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because
LINE 213: she hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,
LINE 214: Marilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful
LINE 215: farewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was
LINE 216: very affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt
LINE 217: dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school
LINE 218: and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.
LINE 219: I can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She
LINE 220: hadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from
LINE 221: school. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come
LINE 222: for us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in
LINE 223: any danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one
LINE 224: can't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation
LINE 225: before them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and
LINE 226: his wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.
LINE 227: Phillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new
LINE 228: minister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,
LINE 229: of course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally
LINE 230: lovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the
LINE 231: minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she
LINE 232: dresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue
LINE 233: muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.
LINE 234: Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for
LINE 235: a minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark,
LINE 236: Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,
LINE 237: she's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should
LINE 238: make allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde
LINE 239: until the manse is ready."
LINE 240: If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by
LINE 241: any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had
LINE 242: borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most
LINE 243: of the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes
LINE 244: never expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the
LINE 245: borrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,
LINE 246: was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement
LINE 247: where sensations were few and far between.
LINE 248: Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in
LINE 249: imagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a
LINE 250: widower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that
LINE 251: gossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year
LINE 252: of his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and
LINE 253: departed amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection
LINE 254: born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his
LINE 255: shortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a
LINE 256: variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various
LINE 257: candidates and "supplies" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on
LINE 258: trial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers
LINE 259: in Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the
LINE 260: corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and
LINE 261: discussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from
LINE 262: principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form.
LINE 263: "I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew" was Anne's final
LINE 264: summing up. "Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his
LINE 265: worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he had no imagination. And Mr.
LINE 266: Terry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in
LINE 267: the matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology
LINE 268: wasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,
LINE 269: but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;
LINE 270: he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,
LINE 271: mustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;
LINE 272: but Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made
LINE 273: special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have
LINE 274: a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the
LINE 275: congregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing
LINE 276: woman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I
LINE 277: liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he
LINE 278: meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.
LINE 279: Mrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't
LINE 280: expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,
LINE 281: and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly
LINE 282: on all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife's people and they
LINE 283: are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde
LINE 284: says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman
LINE 285: make an ideal combination for a minister's family."
LINE 286: The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still
LINE 287: on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for
LINE 288: their chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.
LINE 289: Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,
LINE 290: and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the
LINE 291: manse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.
LINE 292: She had discovered another kindred spirit.
LINE 293: "Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely," she announced one Sunday afternoon.
LINE 294: "She's taken our class and she's a splendid teacher. She said right away
LINE 295: she didn't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,
LINE 296: and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I've always thought. She
LINE 297: said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.
LINE 298: I'm good at asking questions, Marilla."
LINE 299: "I believe you," was Marilla's emphatic comment.
LINE 300: "Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was
LINE 301: to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a
LINE 302: very proper question to ask because it hadn't any connection with the
LINE 303: lesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan
LINE 304: just smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a
LINE 305: lovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had
LINE 306: dimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I
LINE 307: came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence
LINE 308: people for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence
LINE 309: other people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew
LINE 310: before that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it
LINE 311: was kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a
LINE 312: Christian if I could be one like her. I wouldn't want to be one like Mr.
LINE 313: Superintendent Bell."
LINE 314: "It's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell," said Marilla
LINE 315: severely. "Mr. Bell is a real good man."
LINE 316: "Oh, of course he's good," agreed Anne, "but he doesn't seem to get any
LINE 317: comfort out of it. If I could be good I'd dance and sing all day because
LINE 318: I was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and
LINE 319: of course it wouldn't be dignified in a minister's wife. But I can just
LINE 320: feel she's glad she's a Christian and that she'd be one even if she
LINE 321: could get to heaven without it."
LINE 322: "I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon," said
LINE 323: Marilla reflectively. "They've been most everywhere but here. Let me
LINE 324: see. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a
LINE 325: word to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he'd find some
LINE 326: excuse to be away that day. He'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn't
LINE 327: mind him, but he's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new
LINE 328: minister, and a new minister's wife will frighten him to death."
LINE 329: "I'll be as secret as the dead," assured Anne. "But oh, Marilla, will
LINE 330: you let me make a cake for the occasion? I'd love to do something for
LINE 331: Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time."
LINE 332: "You can make a layer cake," promised Marilla.
LINE 333: Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.
LINE 334: Having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important
LINE 335: undertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of
LINE 336: the Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She
LINE 337: talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they
LINE 338: sat on the big red stones by the Dryad's Bubble and made rainbows in the
LINE 339: water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.
LINE 340: "Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I'm to make in the
LINE 341: morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just
LINE 342: before teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy
LINE 343: two days of it. It's such a responsibility having a minister's family to
LINE 344: tea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see
LINE 345: our pantry. It's a sight to behold. We're going to have jellied chicken
LINE 346: and cold tongue. We're to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and
LINE 347: whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,
LINE 348: and fruit cake, and Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves that she
LINE 349: keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and
LINE 350: biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister
LINE 351: is dyspeptic and can't eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic,
LINE 352: but I don't think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to
LINE 353: have had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer
LINE 354: cake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn't be good! I dreamed last night that
LINE 355: I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a
LINE 356: head."
LINE 357: "It'll be good, all right," assured Diana, who was a very comfortable
LINE 358: sort of friend. "I'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for
LINE 359: lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant."
LINE 360: "Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just
LINE 361: when you especially want them to be good," sighed Anne, setting a
LINE 362: particularly well-balsamed twig afloat. "However, I suppose I shall
LINE 363: just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh,
LINE 364: look, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come
LINE 365: out after we go away and take it for a scarf?"
LINE 366: "You know there is no such thing as a dryad," said Diana. Diana's mother
LINE 367: had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over
LINE 368: it. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights
LINE 369: of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of
LINE 370: belief even in harmless dryads.
LINE 371: "But it's so easy to imagine there is," said Anne. "Every night before
LINE 372: I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really
LINE 373: sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes
LINE 374: I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't
LINE 375: give up your faith in the dryad!"
LINE 376: Wednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too
LINE 377: excited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of
LINE 378: her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short
LINE 379: of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary
LINE 380: matters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.
LINE 381: When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.
LINE 382: "I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you
LINE 383: think it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I
LINE 384: used it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of
LINE 385: getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.
LINE 386: Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says
LINE 387: we'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what
LINE 388: if that cake doesn't rise?"
LINE 389: "We'll have plenty without it" was Marilla's unimpassioned way of
LINE 390: looking at the subject.
LINE 391: The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and
LINE 392: feathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together
LINE 393: with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it
LINE 394: and possibly asking for another piece!
LINE 395: "You'll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla," she said. "Can I
LINE 396: fix the table with ferns and wild roses?"
LINE 397: "I think that's all nonsense," sniffed Marilla. "In my opinion it's the
LINE 398: eatables that matter and not flummery decorations."
LINE 399: "Mrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated," said Anne, who was not entirely
LINE 400: guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, "and the minister paid her an
LINE 401: elegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the
LINE 402: palate."
LINE 403: "Well, do as you like," said Marilla, who was quite determined not to
LINE 404: be surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. "Only mind you leave enough
LINE 405: room for the dishes and the food."
LINE 406: Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that
LINE 407: should leave Mrs. Barry's nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns
LINE 408: and a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a
LINE 409: thing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they
LINE 410: exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.
LINE 411: "It's Anne's doings," said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.
LINE 412: Allan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.
LINE 413: Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness
LINE 414: and Anne knew how. He had been in such a state of shyness and
LINE 415: nervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him
LINE 416: in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes
LINE 417: and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.
LINE 418: He never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be
LINE 419: expected.
LINE 420: All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed.
LINE 421: Mrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,
LINE 422: declined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne's face, said
LINE 423: smilingly:
LINE 424: "Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose
LINE 425: for you."
LINE 426: "In that case I must sample it," laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to
LINE 427: a plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.
LINE 428: Mrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression
LINE 429: crossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away
LINE 430: at it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.
LINE 431: "Anne Shirley!" she exclaimed, "what on earth did you put into that
LINE 432: cake?"
LINE 433: "Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla," cried Anne with a look of
LINE 434: anguish. "Oh, isn't it all right?"
LINE 435: "All right! It's simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don't try to eat it. Anne,
LINE 436: taste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?"
LINE 437: "Vanilla," said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting
LINE 438: the cake. "Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking
LINE 439: powder. I had my suspicions of that bak--"
LINE 440: "Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you
LINE 441: used."
LINE 442: Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially
LINE 443: filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, "Best Vanilla."
LINE 444: Marilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.
LINE 445: "Mercy on us, Anne, you've flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I
LINE 446: broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an
LINE 447: old empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have
LINE 448: warned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?"
LINE 449: Anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.
LINE 450: "I couldn't--I had such a cold!" and with this she fairly fled to the
LINE 451: gable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who
LINE 452: refuses to be comforted.
LINE 453: Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the
LINE 454: room.
LINE 455: "Oh, Marilla," sobbed Anne, without looking up, "I'm disgraced forever.
LINE 456: I shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always
LINE 457: do get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I
LINE 458: shall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the
LINE 459: girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school
LINE 460: will never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark
LINE 461: of Christian pity don't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes
LINE 462: after this. I'll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but
LINE 463: I cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she'll think I
LINE 464: tried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried
LINE 465: to poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn't poisonous. It's meant
LINE 466: to be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won't you tell Mrs. Allan
LINE 467: so, Marilla?"
LINE 468: "Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself," said a merry voice.
LINE 469: Anne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with
LINE 470: laughing eyes.
LINE 471: "My dear little girl, you mustn't cry like this," she said, genuinely
LINE 472: disturbed by Anne's tragic face. "Why, it's all just a funny mistake
LINE 473: that anybody might make."
LINE 474: "Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake," said Anne forlornly. "And
LINE 475: I wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan."
LINE 476: "Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and
LINE 477: thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now,
LINE 478: you mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower
LINE 479: garden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I
LINE 480: want to see it, for I'm very much interested in flowers."
LINE 481: Anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it
LINE 482: was really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing
LINE 483: more was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away
LINE 484: Anne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been
LINE 485: expected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed
LINE 486: deeply.
LINE 487: "Marilla, isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no
LINE 488: mistakes in it yet?"
LINE 489: "I'll warrant you'll make plenty in it," said Marilla. "I never saw your
LINE 490: beat for making mistakes, Anne."
LINE 491: "Yes, and well I know it," admitted Anne mournfully. "But have you ever
LINE 492: noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same
LINE 493: mistake twice."
LINE 494: "I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new
LINE 495: ones."
LINE 496: "Oh, don't you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one
LINE 497: person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through
LINE 498: with them. That's a very comforting thought."
LINE 499: "Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs," said Marilla.
LINE 500: "It isn't fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry Boute."
