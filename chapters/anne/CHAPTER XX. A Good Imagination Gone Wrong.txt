LINE 1: SPRING had come once more to Green Gables--the beautiful capricious,
LINE 2: reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a
LINE 3: succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles
LINE 4: of resurrection and growth. The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded
LINE 5: and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in
LINE 6: the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed
LINE 7: out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the
LINE 8: school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming
LINE 9: home in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of
LINE 10: flowery spoil.
LINE 11: "I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no
LINE 12: Mayflowers," said Anne. "Diana says perhaps they have something better,
LINE 13: but there couldn't be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,
LINE 14: Marilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't
LINE 15: miss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it
LINE 16: would be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_
LINE 17: to miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think
LINE 18: they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this
LINE 19: is their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our
LINE 20: lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.
LINE 21: Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because
LINE 22: he wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_
LINE 23: to dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews
LINE 24: and I heard him to say 'sweets to the sweet.' He got that out of a
LINE 25: book, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some
LINE 26: Mayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the
LINE 27: person's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We
LINE 28: made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the
LINE 29: time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,
LINE 30: with our bouquets and wreaths, singing 'My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was
LINE 31: so thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us
LINE 32: and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a
LINE 33: real sensation."
LINE 34: "Not much wonder! Such silly doings!" was Marilla's response.
LINE 35: After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled
LINE 36: with them. Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent
LINE 37: steps and worshiping eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.
LINE 38: "Somehow," she told Diana, "when I'm going through here I don't really
LINE 39: care whether Gil--whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not. But
LINE 40: when I'm up in school it's all different and I care as much as ever.
LINE 41: There's such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is
LINE 42: why I'm such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would
LINE 43: be ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn't be half so
LINE 44: interesting."
LINE 45: One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the
LINE 46: frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the
LINE 47: Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover
LINE 48: fields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window.
LINE 49: She had been studying her lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the
LINE 50: book, so she had fallen into wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the
LINE 51: boughs of the Snow Queen, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom.
LINE 52: In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged. The
LINE 53: walls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly
LINE 54: and yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was
LINE 55: altered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to
LINE 56: pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses
LINE 57: and ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms
LINE 58: on the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its
LINE 59: vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had
LINE 60: tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and
LINE 61: moonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne's freshly
LINE 62: ironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with
LINE 63: a short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and
LINE 64: although the pain had gone she felt weak and "tuckered out," as she
LINE 65: expressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.
LINE 66: "I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla. I
LINE 67: would have endured it joyfully for your sake."
LINE 68: "I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me
LINE 69: rest," said Marilla. "You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer
LINE 70: mistakes than usual. Of course it wasn't exactly necessary to starch
LINE 71: Matthew's handkerchiefs! And most people when they put a pie in the oven
LINE 72: to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of
LINE 73: leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way
LINE 74: evidently."
LINE 75: Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.
LINE 76: "Oh, I'm so sorry," said Anne penitently. "I never thought about that
LINE 77: pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt
LINE 78: _instinctively_ that there was something missing on the dinner table. I
LINE 79: was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to
LINE 80: imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts. I did pretty well until
LINE 81: I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to
LINE 82: imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a
LINE 83: handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed. So that
LINE 84: is how I came to forget the pie. I didn't know I starched the
LINE 85: handkerchiefs. All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a
LINE 86: name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook. It's the
LINE 87: most ravishing spot, Marilla. There are two maple trees on it and the
LINE 88: brook flows right around it. At last it struck me that it would be
LINE 89: splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen's
LINE 90: birthday. Both Diana and I are very loyal. But I'm sorry about that pie
LINE 91: and the handkerchiefs. I wanted to be extra good today because it's an
LINE 92: anniversary. Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?"
LINE 93: "No, I can't think of anything special."
LINE 94: "Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables. I shall never
LINE 95: forget it. It was the turning point in my life. Of course it wouldn't
LINE 96: seem so important to you. I've been here for a year and I've been so
LINE 97: happy. Of course, I've had my troubles, but one can live down troubles.
LINE 98: Are you sorry you kept me, Marilla?"
LINE 99: "No, I can't say I'm sorry," said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how
LINE 100: she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, "no, not exactly
LINE 101: sorry. If you've finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and
LINE 102: ask Mrs. Barry if she'll lend me Diana's apron pattern."
LINE 103: "Oh--it's--it's too dark," cried Anne.
LINE 104: "Too dark? Why, it's only twilight. And goodness knows you've gone over
LINE 105: often enough after dark."
LINE 106: "I'll go over early in the morning," said Anne eagerly. "I'll get up at
LINE 107: sunrise and go over, Marilla."
LINE 108: "What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley? I want that pattern to
LINE 109: cut out your new apron this evening. Go at once and be smart too."
LINE 110: "I'll have to go around by the road, then," said Anne, taking up her hat
LINE 111: reluctantly.
LINE 112: "Go by the road and waste half an hour! I'd like to catch you!"
LINE 113: "I can't go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla," cried Anne desperately.
LINE 114: Marilla stared.
LINE 115: "The Haunted Wood! Are you crazy? What under the canopy is the Haunted
LINE 116: Wood?"
LINE 117: "The spruce wood over the brook," said Anne in a whisper.
LINE 118: "Fiddlesticks! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who
LINE 119: has been telling you such stuff?"
LINE 120: "Nobody," confessed Anne. "Diana and I just imagined the wood was
LINE 121: haunted. All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_. We just got
LINE 122: this up for our own amusement. We began it in April. A haunted wood is
LINE 123: so very romantic, Marilla. We chose the spruce grove because it's so
LINE 124: gloomy. Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things. There's a white
LINE 125: lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings
LINE 126: her hands and utters wailing cries. She appears when there is to be a
LINE 127: death in the family. And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the
LINE 128: corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers
LINE 129: on your hand--so. Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it. And
LINE 130: there's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower
LINE 131: at you between the boughs. Oh, Marilla, I wouldn't go through the
LINE 132: Haunted Wood after dark now for anything. I'd be sure that white things
LINE 133: would reach out from behind the trees and grab me."
LINE 134: "Did ever anyone hear the like!" ejaculated Marilla, who had
LINE 135: listened in dumb amazement. "Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you
LINE 136: believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?"
LINE 137: "Not believe _exactly_," faltered Anne. "At least, I don't believe it in
LINE 138: daylight. But after dark, Marilla, it's different. That is when ghosts
LINE 139: walk."
LINE 140: "There are no such things as ghosts, Anne."
LINE 141: "Oh, but there are, Marilla," cried Anne eagerly. "I know people who
LINE 142: have seen them. And they are respectable people. Charlie Sloane says
LINE 143: that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night
LINE 144: after he'd been buried for a year. You know Charlie Sloane's grandmother
LINE 145: wouldn't tell a story for anything. She's a very religious woman. And
LINE 146: Mrs. Thomas's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with
LINE 147: its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the
LINE 148: spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine
LINE 149: days. He didn't, but he died two years after, so you see it was really
LINE 150: true. And Ruby Gillis says--"
LINE 151: "Anne Shirley," interrupted Marilla firmly, "I never want to hear you
LINE 152: talking in this fashion again. I've had my doubts about that imagination
LINE 153: of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I
LINE 154: won't countenance any such doings. You'll go right over to Barry's, and
LINE 155: you'll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to
LINE 156: you. And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods
LINE 157: again."
LINE 158: Anne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very
LINE 159: real. Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce
LINE 160: grove in mortal dread after nightfall. But Marilla was inexorable. She
LINE 161: marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her
LINE 162: to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of
LINE 163: wailing ladies and headless specters beyond.
LINE 164: "Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?" sobbed Anne. "What would you
LINE 165: feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?"
LINE 166: "I'll risk it," said Marilla unfeelingly. "You know I always mean what I
LINE 167: say. I'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places. March, now."
LINE 168: Anne marched. That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering
LINE 169: up the horrible dim path beyond. Anne never forgot that walk. Bitterly
LINE 170: did she repent the license she had given to her imagination. The goblins
LINE 171: of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold,
LINE 172: fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them
LINE 173: into being. A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over
LINE 174: the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still. The long-drawn
LINE 175: wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the
LINE 176: perspiration in beads on her forehead. The swoop of bats in the darkness
LINE 177: over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures. When she reached Mr.
LINE 178: William Bell's field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of
LINE 179: white things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath
LINE 180: that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern.
LINE 181: Diana was away so that she had no excuse to linger. The dreadful
LINE 182: return journey had to be faced. Anne went back over it with shut eyes,
LINE 183: preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs
LINE 184: to that of seeing a white thing. When she finally stumbled over the log
LINE 185: bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief.
LINE 186: "Well, so nothing caught you?" said Marilla unsympathetically.
LINE 187: "Oh, Mar--Marilla," chattered Anne, "I'll b-b-be contt-tented with
LINE 188: c-c-commonplace places after this."
