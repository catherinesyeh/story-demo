LINE 1: MARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had
LINE 2: gone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in
LINE 3: the kitchen, sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand.
LINE 4: Something in her dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne's heart. She
LINE 5: had never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.
LINE 6: "Are you very tired, Marilla?"
LINE 7: "Yes--no--I don't know," said Marilla wearily, looking up. "I suppose I
LINE 8: am tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that."
LINE 9: "Did you see the oculist? What did he say?" asked Anne anxiously.
LINE 10: "Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all
LINE 11: reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,
LINE 12: and if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he's given me
LINE 13: he thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.
LINE 14: But if I don't he says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months.
LINE 15: Blind! Anne, just think of it!"
LINE 16: For a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was
LINE 17: silent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said
LINE 18: bravely, but with a catch in her voice:
LINE 19: "Marilla, _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are
LINE 20: careful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure
LINE 21: your headaches it will be a great thing."
LINE 22: "I don't call it much hope," said Marilla bitterly. "What am I to live
LINE 23: for if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well
LINE 24: be blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get
LINE 25: lonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me
LINE 26: a cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything
LINE 27: about this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks
LINE 28: should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it."
LINE 29: When Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then
LINE 30: Anne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the
LINE 31: darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly
LINE 32: things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!
LINE 33: Then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy
LINE 34: with promise. Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before
LINE 35: she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.
LINE 36: She had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a
LINE 37: friend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.
LINE 38: One afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front
LINE 39: yard where she had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by
LINE 40: sight as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been
LINE 41: saying to bring that look to Marilla's face.
LINE 42: "What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?"
LINE 43: Marilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in
LINE 44: her eyes in defiance of the oculist's prohibition and her voice broke as
LINE 45: she said:
LINE 46: "He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it."
LINE 47: "Buy it! Buy Green Gables?" Anne wondered if she had heard aright. "Oh,
LINE 48: Marilla, you don't mean to sell Green Gables!"
LINE 49: "Anne, I don't know what else is to be done. I've thought it all over.
LINE 50: If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after
LINE 51: things and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can't. I may
LINE 52: lose my sight altogether; and anyway I'll not be fit to run things. Oh,
LINE 53: I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home.
LINE 54: But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till
LINE 55: nobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank;
LINE 56: and there's some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises
LINE 57: me to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her I suppose. It won't
LINE 58: bring much--it's small and the buildings are old. But it'll be enough
LINE 59: for me to live on I reckon. I'm thankful you're provided for with that
LINE 60: scholarship, Anne. I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your
LINE 61: vacations, that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow."
LINE 62: Marilla broke down and wept bitterly.
LINE 63: "You mustn't sell Green Gables," said Anne resolutely.
LINE 64: "Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to. But you can see for yourself. I
LINE 65: can't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my
LINE 66: sight would go--I know it would."
LINE 67: "You won't have to stay here alone, Marilla. I'll be with you. I'm not
LINE 68: going to Redmond."
LINE 69: "Not going to Redmond!" Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and
LINE 70: looked at Anne. "Why, what do you mean?"
LINE 71: "Just what I say. I'm not going to take the scholarship. I decided so
LINE 72: the night after you came home from town. You surely don't think I could
LINE 73: leave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you've done for me.
LINE 74: I've been thinking and planning. Let me tell you my plans. Mr. Barry
LINE 75: wants to rent the farm for next year. So you won't have any bother over
LINE 76: that. And I'm going to teach. I've applied for the school here--but I
LINE 77: don't expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to
LINE 78: Gilbert Blythe. But I can have the Carmody school--Mr. Blair told me
LINE 79: so last night at the store. Of course that won't be quite as nice or
LINE 80: convenient as if I had the Avonlea school. But I can board home and
LINE 81: drive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. And
LINE 82: even in winter I can come home Fridays. We'll keep a horse for that. Oh,
LINE 83: I have it all planned out, Marilla. And I'll read to you and keep you
LINE 84: cheered up. You sha'n't be dull or lonesome. And we'll be real cozy and
LINE 85: happy here together, you and I."
LINE 86: Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream.
LINE 87: "Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know. But I
LINE 88: can't let you sacrifice yourself so for me. It would be terrible."
LINE 89: "Nonsense!" Anne laughed merrily. "There is no sacrifice. Nothing could
LINE 90: be worse than giving up Green Gables--nothing could hurt me more. We
LINE 91: must keep the dear old place. My mind is quite made up, Marilla. I'm _not_
LINE 92: going to Redmond; and I _am_ going to stay here and teach. Don't you worry
LINE 93: about me a bit."
LINE 94: "But your ambitions--and--"
LINE 95: "I'm just as ambitious as ever. Only, I've changed the object of my
LINE 96: ambitions. I'm going to be a good teacher--and I'm going to save your
LINE 97: eyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little
LINE 98: college course all by myself. Oh, I've dozens of plans, Marilla. I've
LINE 99: been thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and
LINE 100: I believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen's my
LINE 101: future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought
LINE 102: I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I
LINE 103: don't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the
LINE 104: best does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder
LINE 105: how the road beyond it goes--what there is of green glory and
LINE 106: soft, checkered light and shadows--what new landscapes--what new
LINE 107: beauties--what curves and hills and valleys further on."
LINE 108: "I don't feel as if I ought to let you give it up," said Marilla,
LINE 109: referring to the scholarship.
LINE 110: "But you can't prevent me. I'm sixteen and a half, 'obstinate as a
LINE 111: mule,' as Mrs. Lynde once told me," laughed Anne. "Oh, Marilla, don't
LINE 112: you go pitying me. I don't like to be pitied, and there is no need
LINE 113: for it. I'm heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green
LINE 114: Gables. Nobody could love it as you and I do--so we must keep it."
LINE 115: "You blessed girl!" said Marilla, yielding. "I feel as if you'd given me
LINE 116: new life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but
LINE 117: I know I can't, so I ain't going to try. I'll make it up to you though,
LINE 118: Anne."
LINE 119: When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up
LINE 120: the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there
LINE 121: was a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not
LINE 122: knowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did
LINE 123: not. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure
LINE 124: to the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening
LINE 125: and found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,
LINE 126: scented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down
LINE 127: and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled
LINE 128: the dewy air.
LINE 129: Mrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the
LINE 130: door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a
LINE 131: long breath of mingled weariness and relief.
LINE 132: "I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day,
LINE 133: and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's
LINE 134: a great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,
LINE 135: Anne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was
LINE 136: real glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be
LINE 137: comfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men
LINE 138: and cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense."
LINE 139: "But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde," said
LINE 140: Anne laughing. "I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green
LINE 141: Gables, and study everything that I would at college."
LINE 142: Mrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.
LINE 143: "Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself."
LINE 144: "Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo
LINE 145: things. As 'Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be 'mejum'. But I'll
LINE 146: have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no
LINE 147: vocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know."
LINE 148: "I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea.
LINE 149: The trustees have decided to give you the school."
LINE 150: "Mrs. Lynde!" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. "Why, I
LINE 151: thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!"
LINE 152: "So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it
LINE 153: he went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,
LINE 154: you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested
LINE 155: that they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of
LINE 156: course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must
LINE 157: say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real
LINE 158: self-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands,
LINE 159: and everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the
LINE 160: trustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came
LINE 161: home and told me."
LINE 162: "I don't feel that I ought to take it," murmured Anne. "I mean--I don't
LINE 163: think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me."
LINE 164: "I guess you can't prevent him now. He's signed papers with the White
LINE 165: Sands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to
LINE 166: refuse. Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right,
LINE 167: now that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a
LINE 168: good thing she was, that's what. There's been some Pye or other going to
LINE 169: Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in
LINE 170: life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn't their home.
LINE 171: Bless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry
LINE 172: gable mean?"
LINE 173: "Diana is signaling for me to go over," laughed Anne. "You know we keep
LINE 174: up the old custom. Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants."
LINE 175: Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry
LINE 176: shadows of the Haunted Wood. Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.
LINE 177: "There's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways."
LINE 178: "There's a good deal more of the woman about her in others," retorted
LINE 179: Marilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.
LINE 180: But crispness was no longer Marilla's distinguishing characteristic. As
LINE 181: Mrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.
LINE 182: "Marilla Cuthbert has got _mellow_. That's what."
LINE 183: Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh
LINE 184: flowers on Matthew's grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered
LINE 185: there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place,
LINE 186: with its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its
LINE 187: whispering grasses growing at will among the graves. When she finally
LINE 188: left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining
LINE 189: Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike
LINE 190: afterlight--"a haunt of ancient peace." There was a freshness in the
LINE 191: air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home
LINE 192: lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay
LINE 193: the sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west
LINE 194: was a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in
LINE 195: still softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled Anne's heart, and
LINE 196: she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.
LINE 197: "Dear old world," she murmured, "you are very lovely, and I am glad to
LINE 198: be alive in you."
LINE 199: Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the
LINE 200: Blythe homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he
LINE 201: recognized Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed
LINE 202: on in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.
LINE 203: "Gilbert," she said, with scarlet cheeks, "I want to thank you for
LINE 204: giving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to
LINE 205: know that I appreciate it."
LINE 206: Gilbert took the offered hand eagerly.
LINE 207: "It wasn't particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be
LINE 208: able to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after
LINE 209: this? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?"
LINE 210: Anne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.
LINE 211: "I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn't know
LINE 212: it. What a stubborn little goose I was. I've been--I may as well make a
LINE 213: complete confession--I've been sorry ever since."
LINE 214: "We are going to be the best of friends," said Gilbert, jubilantly. "We
LINE 215: were born to be good friends, Anne. You've thwarted destiny enough. I
LINE 216: know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your
LINE 217: studies, aren't you? So am I. Come, I'm going to walk home with you."
LINE 218: Marilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.
LINE 219: "Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?"
LINE 220: "Gilbert Blythe," answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. "I met
LINE 221: him on Barry's hill."
LINE 222: "I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd
LINE 223: stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him," said Marilla with a
LINE 224: dry smile.
LINE 225: "We haven't been--we've been good enemies. But we have decided that it
LINE 226: will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we
LINE 227: really there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,
LINE 228: we have five years' lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla."
LINE 229: Anne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.
LINE 230: The wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came
LINE 231: up to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and
LINE 232: Diana's light gleamed through the old gap.
LINE 233: Anne's horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after
LINE 234: coming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be
LINE 235: narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.
LINE 236: The joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship
LINE 237: were to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her
LINE 238: ideal world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!
LINE 239: "'God's in his heaven, all's right with the world,'" whispered Anne
LINE 240: softly.
