LINE 1: MARILLA said nothing to Matthew about the affair that evening; but when
LINE 2: Anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be
LINE 3: made to account for her absence from the breakfast table. Marilla told
LINE 4: Matthew the whole story, taking pains to impress him with a due sense of
LINE 5: the enormity of Anne's behavior.
LINE 6: "It's a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she's a meddlesome
LINE 7: old gossip," was Matthew's consolatory rejoinder.
LINE 8: "Matthew Cuthbert, I'm astonished at you. You know that Anne's behavior
LINE 9: was dreadful, and yet you take her part! I suppose you'll be saying next
LINE 10: thing that she oughtn't to be punished at all!"
LINE 11: "Well now--no--not exactly," said Matthew uneasily. "I reckon she
LINE 12: ought to be punished a little. But don't be too hard on her, Marilla.
LINE 13: Recollect she hasn't ever had anyone to teach her right. You're--you're
LINE 14: going to give her something to eat, aren't you?"
LINE 15: "When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?"
LINE 16: demanded Marilla indignantly. "She'll have her meals regular, and
LINE 17: I'll carry them up to her myself. But she'll stay up there until she's
LINE 18: willing to apologize to Mrs. Lynde, and that's final, Matthew."
LINE 19: Breakfast, dinner, and supper were very silent meals--for Anne still
LINE 20: remained obdurate. After each meal Marilla carried a well-filled tray
LINE 21: to the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted.
LINE 22: Matthew eyed its last descent with a troubled eye. Had Anne eaten
LINE 23: anything at all?
LINE 24: When Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back
LINE 25: pasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching,
LINE 26: slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs. As
LINE 27: a general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little
LINE 28: bedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured
LINE 29: uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to
LINE 30: tea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he
LINE 31: helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.
LINE 32: He tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the
LINE 33: door of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his
LINE 34: fingers and then open the door to peep in.
LINE 35: Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out
LINE 36: into the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew's heart
LINE 37: smote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.
LINE 38: "Anne," he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, "how are you
LINE 39: making it, Anne?"
LINE 40: Anne smiled wanly.
LINE 41: "Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of
LINE 42: course, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that."
LINE 43: Anne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary
LINE 44: imprisonment before her.
LINE 45: Matthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without
LINE 46: loss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. "Well now, Anne, don't
LINE 47: you think you'd better do it and have it over with?" he whispered.
LINE 48: "It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla's a
LINE 49: dreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off,
LINE 50: I say, and have it over."
LINE 51: "Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?"
LINE 52: "Yes--apologize--that's the very word," said Matthew eagerly. "Just
LINE 53: smooth it over so to speak. That's what I was trying to get at."
LINE 54: "I suppose I could do it to oblige you," said Anne thoughtfully. "It
LINE 55: would be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn't
LINE 56: a bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all
LINE 57: night. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just
LINE 58: furious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn't in a temper
LINE 59: anymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed
LINE 60: of myself. But I just couldn't think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde
LINE 61: so. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I'd stay shut up here
LINE 62: forever rather than do that. But still--I'd do anything for you--if you
LINE 63: really want me to--"
LINE 64: "Well now, of course I do. It's terrible lonesome downstairs without
LINE 65: you. Just go and smooth things over--that's a good girl."
LINE 66: "Very well," said Anne resignedly. "I'll tell Marilla as soon as she
LINE 67: comes in I've repented."
LINE 68: "That's right--that's right, Anne. But don't tell Marilla I said
LINE 69: anything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I
LINE 70: promised not to do that."
LINE 71: "Wild horses won't drag the secret from me," promised Anne solemnly.
LINE 72: "How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?"
LINE 73: But Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the
LINE 74: remotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what
LINE 75: he had been up to. Marilla herself, upon her return to the house, was
LINE 76: agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling, "Marilla" over
LINE 77: the banisters.
LINE 78: "Well?" she said, going into the hall.
LINE 79: "I'm sorry I lost my temper and said rude things, and I'm willing to go
LINE 80: and tell Mrs. Lynde so."
LINE 81: "Very well." Marilla's crispness gave no sign of her relief. She had
LINE 82: been wondering what under the canopy she should do if Anne did not give
LINE 83: in. "I'll take you down after milking."
LINE 84: Accordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne walking down the
LINE 85: lane, the former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected.
LINE 86: But halfway down Anne's dejection vanished as if by enchantment. She
LINE 87: lifted her head and stepped lightly along, her eyes fixed on the sunset
LINE 88: sky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her. Marilla beheld the
LINE 89: change disapprovingly. This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her
LINE 90: to take into the presence of the offended Mrs. Lynde.
LINE 91: "What are you thinking of, Anne?" she asked sharply.
LINE 92: "I'm imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde," answered Anne
LINE 93: dreamily.
LINE 94: This was satisfactory--or should have been so. But Marilla could not
LINE 95: rid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was
LINE 96: going askew. Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant.
LINE 97: Rapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence
LINE 98: of Mrs. Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window. Then the
LINE 99: radiance vanished. Mournful penitence appeared on every feature. Before
LINE 100: a word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the
LINE 101: astonished Mrs. Rachel and held out her hands beseechingly.
LINE 102: "Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry," she said with a quiver in
LINE 103: her voice. "I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up
LINE 104: a whole dictionary. You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to
LINE 105: you--and I've disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have
LINE 106: let me stay at Green Gables although I'm not a boy. I'm a dreadfully
LINE 107: wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out
LINE 108: by respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a
LINE 109: temper because you told me the truth. It _was_ the truth; every word you
LINE 110: said was true. My hair is red and I'm freckled and skinny and ugly.
LINE 111: What I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it. Oh, Mrs.
LINE 112: Lynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong
LINE 113: sorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a
LINE 114: dreadful temper? Oh, I am sure you wouldn't. Please say you forgive me,
LINE 115: Mrs. Lynde."
LINE 116: Anne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word
LINE 117: of judgment.
LINE 118: There was no mistaking her sincerity--it breathed in every tone of her
LINE 119: voice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.
LINE 120: But the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying
LINE 121: her valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her
LINE 122: abasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla,
LINE 123: had plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive
LINE 124: pleasure.
LINE 125: Good Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see
LINE 126: this. She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and
LINE 127: all resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.
LINE 128: "There, there, get up, child," she said heartily. "Of course I forgive
LINE 129: you. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I'm such an
LINE 130: outspoken person. You just mustn't mind me, that's what. It can't be
LINE 131: denied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school
LINE 132: with her, in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she
LINE 133: was young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn. I
LINE 134: wouldn't be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite."
LINE 135: "Oh, Mrs. Lynde!" Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. "You
LINE 136: have given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh,
LINE 137: I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome
LINE 138: auburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one's
LINE 139: hair was a handsome auburn, don't you think? And now may I go out into
LINE 140: your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and
LINE 141: Marilla are talking? There is so much more scope for imagination out
LINE 142: there."
LINE 143: "Laws, yes, run along, child. And you can pick a bouquet of them white
LINE 144: June lilies over in the corner if you like."
LINE 145: As the door closed behind Anne Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a
LINE 146: lamp.
LINE 147: "She's a real odd little thing. Take this chair, Marilla; it's easier
LINE 148: than the one you've got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit
LINE 149: on. Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of
LINE 150: taking about her after all. I don't feel so surprised at you and Matthew
LINE 151: keeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either. She may turn out all
LINE 152: right. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself--a little
LINE 153: too--well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she'll likely get over
LINE 154: that now that she's come to live among civilized folks. And then, her
LINE 155: temper's pretty quick, I guess; but there's one comfort, a child that
LINE 156: has a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain't never likely to
LINE 157: be sly or deceitful. Preserve me from a sly child, that's what. On the
LINE 158: whole, Marilla, I kind of like her."
LINE 159: When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the
LINE 160: orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.
LINE 161: "I apologized pretty well, didn't I?" she said proudly as they went
LINE 162: down the lane. "I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it
LINE 163: thoroughly."
LINE 164: "You did it thoroughly, all right enough," was Marilla's comment.
LINE 165: Marilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the
LINE 166: recollection. She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold
LINE 167: Anne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous! She
LINE 168: compromised with her conscience by saying severely:
LINE 169: "I hope you won't have occasion to make many more such apologies. I hope
LINE 170: you'll try to control your temper now, Anne."
LINE 171: "That wouldn't be so hard if people wouldn't twit me about my looks,"
LINE 172: said Anne with a sigh. "I don't get cross about other things; but I'm
LINE 173: _so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right
LINE 174: over. Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I
LINE 175: grow up?"
LINE 176: "You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are
LINE 177: a very vain little girl."
LINE 178: "How can I be vain when I know I'm homely?" protested Anne. "I love
LINE 179: pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that
LINE 180: isn't pretty. It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look
LINE 181: at any ugly thing. I pity it because it isn't beautiful."
LINE 182: "Handsome is as handsome does," quoted Marilla. "I've had that said
LINE 183: to me before, but I have my doubts about it," remarked skeptical Anne,
LINE 184: sniffing at her narcissi. "Oh, aren't these flowers sweet! It was lovely
LINE 185: of Mrs. Lynde to give them to me. I have no hard feelings against Mrs.
LINE 186: Lynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and
LINE 187: be forgiven, doesn't it? Aren't the stars bright tonight? If you could
LINE 188: live in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big
LINE 189: one away over there above that dark hill."
LINE 190: "Anne, do hold your tongue," said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to
LINE 191: follow the gyrations of Anne's thoughts.
LINE 192: Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane. A little gypsy
LINE 193: wind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young
LINE 194: dew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out
LINE 195: through the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came
LINE 196: close to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman's hard palm.
LINE 197: "It's lovely to be going home and know it's home," she said. "I love
LINE 198: Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever
LINE 199: seemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I'm so happy. I could pray right now and
LINE 200: not find it a bit hard."
LINE 201: Something warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla's heart at touch of
LINE 202: that thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had
LINE 203: missed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed
LINE 204: her. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by
LINE 205: inculcating a moral.
LINE 206: "If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, Anne. And you should
LINE 207: never find it hard to say your prayers."
LINE 208: "Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying," said
LINE 209: Anne meditatively. "But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is
LINE 210: blowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I'll
LINE 211: imagine I'm gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I'll fly over
LINE 212: to Mrs. Lynde's garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I'll go
LINE 213: with one great swoop over the clover field--and then I'll blow over the
LINE 214: Lake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.
LINE 215: Oh, there's so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I'll not talk
LINE 216: any more just now, Marilla."
LINE 217: "Thanks be to goodness for that," breathed Marilla in devout relief.
