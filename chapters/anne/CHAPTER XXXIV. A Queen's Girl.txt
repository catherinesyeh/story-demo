LINE 1: THE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was
LINE 2: getting ready to go to Queen's, and there was much sewing to be done,
LINE 3: and many things to be talked over and arranged. Anne's outfit was
LINE 4: ample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made
LINE 5: no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one
LINE 6: evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate
LINE 7: pale green material.
LINE 8: "Anne, here's something for a nice light dress for you. I don't suppose
LINE 9: you really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe
LINE 10: you'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere
LINE 11: of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that
LINE 12: Jane and Ruby and Josie have got 'evening dresses,' as they call them,
LINE 13: and I don't mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me
LINE 14: pick it in town last week, and we'll get Emily Gillis to make it for
LINE 15: you. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren't to be equaled."
LINE 16: "Oh, Marilla, it's just lovely," said Anne. "Thank you so much. I don't
LINE 17: believe you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day
LINE 18: for me to go away."
LINE 19: The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings
LINE 20: as Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's
LINE 21: and Marilla's benefit, and recited "The Maiden's Vow" for them in the
LINE 22: kitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful
LINE 23: motions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green
LINE 24: Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child
LINE 25: in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking
LINE 26: out of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to
LINE 27: Marilla's own eyes.
LINE 28: "I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla," said Anne gaily
LINE 29: stooping over Marilla's chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady's
LINE 30: cheek. "Now, I call that a positive triumph."
LINE 31: "No, I wasn't crying over your piece," said Marilla, who would have
LINE 32: scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. "I just
LINE 33: couldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And
LINE 34: I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your
LINE 35: queer ways. You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so
LINE 36: tall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if
LINE 37: you didn't belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it
LINE 38: all over."
LINE 39: "Marilla!" Anne sat down on Marilla's gingham lap, took Marilla's lined
LINE 40: face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla's
LINE 41: eyes. "I'm not a bit changed--not really. I'm only just pruned down and
LINE 42: branched out. The real _me_--back here--is just the same. It won't make a
LINE 43: bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I
LINE 44: shall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear
LINE 45: Green Gables more and better every day of her life."
LINE 46: Anne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla's faded one, and reached
LINE 47: out a hand to pat Matthew's shoulder. Marilla would have given much just
LINE 48: then to have possessed Anne's power of putting her feelings into words;
LINE 49: but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her
LINE 50: arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing
LINE 51: that she need never let her go.
LINE 52: Matthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went
LINE 53: out-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked
LINE 54: agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.
LINE 55: "Well now, I guess she ain't been much spoiled," he muttered, proudly.
LINE 56: "I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.
LINE 57: She's smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the
LINE 58: rest. She's been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake
LINE 59: than what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck. I don't believe it was any
LINE 60: such thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I
LINE 61: reckon."
LINE 62: The day finally came when Anne must go to town. She and Matthew drove
LINE 63: in one fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Diana and an
LINE 64: untearful practical one--on Marilla's side at least--with Marilla. But
LINE 65: when Anne had gone Diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at
LINE 66: White Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she contrived
LINE 67: to enjoy herself tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely into
LINE 68: unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of
LINE 69: heartache--the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away
LINE 70: in ready tears. But that night, when Marilla went to bed, acutely and
LINE 71: miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the
LINE 72: hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft
LINE 73: breathing, she buried her face in her pillow, and wept for her girl in
LINE 74: a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect
LINE 75: how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.
LINE 76: Anne and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to
LINE 77: hurry off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a
LINE 78: whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the
LINE 79: professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne
LINE 80: intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss
LINE 81: Stacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a
LINE 82: First Class teacher's license in one year instead of two, if they were
LINE 83: successful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby,
LINE 84: Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the
LINE 85: stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.
LINE 86: Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in
LINE 87: a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the
LINE 88: tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion
LINE 89: she did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.
LINE 90: Yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old
LINE 91: rivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what
LINE 92: to do if it had been lacking.
LINE 93: "I wouldn't feel comfortable without it," she thought. "Gilbert looks
LINE 94: awfully determined. I suppose he's making up his mind, here and now, to
LINE 95: win the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before.
LINE 96: I do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I
LINE 97: won't feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted,
LINE 98: though. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends.
LINE 99: It's really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that
LINE 100: no Queen's girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear
LINE 101: to me as she is; but I've lots of second-best affections to bestow. I
LINE 102: like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.
LINE 103: She looks vivid and red-rosy; there's that pale, fair one gazing out of
LINE 104: the window. She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two
LINE 105: about dreams. I'd like to know them both--know them well--well enough to
LINE 106: walk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just
LINE 107: now I don't know them and they don't know me, and probably don't want to
LINE 108: know me particularly. Oh, it's lonesome!"
LINE 109: It was lonesomer still when Anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom
LINE 110: that night at twilight. She was not to board with the other girls, who
LINE 111: all had relatives in town to take pity on them. Miss Josephine Barry
LINE 112: would have liked to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the
LINE 113: Academy that it was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a
LINE 114: boarding-house, assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place
LINE 115: for Anne.
LINE 116: "The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman," explained Miss Barry.
LINE 117: "Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort
LINE 118: of boarders she takes. Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons
LINE 119: under her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in
LINE 120: a quiet neighborhood."
LINE 121: All this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did
LINE 122: not materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized
LINE 123: upon her. She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its
LINE 124: dull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty
LINE 125: book-case; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of
LINE 126: her own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant
LINE 127: consciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in
LINE 128: the garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the
LINE 129: slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a
LINE 130: vast starry sky, and the light from Diana's window shining out through
LINE 131: the gap in the trees. Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that
LINE 132: outside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone
LINE 133: wires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand
LINE 134: lights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry,
LINE 135: and fought against it.
LINE 136: "I _won't_ cry. It's silly--and weak--there's the third tear splashing
LINE 137: down by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of something funny
LINE 138: to stop them. But there's nothing funny except what is connected with
LINE 139: Avonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I'm going home
LINE 140: next Friday, but that seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly
LINE 141: home by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for
LINE 142: him--six--seven--eight--oh, there's no use in counting them! They're
LINE 143: coming in a flood presently. I can't cheer up--I don't _want_ to cheer up.
LINE 144: It's nicer to be miserable!"
LINE 145: The flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared
LINE 146: at that moment. In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that
LINE 147: there had never been much love lost between her and Josie. As a part of
LINE 148: Avonlea life even a Pye was welcome.
LINE 149: "I'm so glad you came up," Anne said sincerely.
LINE 150: "You've been crying," remarked Josie, with aggravating pity. "I suppose
LINE 151: you're homesick--some people have so little self-control in that
LINE 152: respect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too
LINE 153: jolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so
LINE 154: long. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes
LINE 155: get red, and then you seem _all_ red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in
LINE 156: the Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache
LINE 157: would give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable
LINE 158: around, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla 'd
LINE 159: load you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd have
LINE 160: gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards
LINE 161: same place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and
LINE 162: asked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that
LINE 163: the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd
LINE 164: been before that."
LINE 165: Anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more
LINE 166: satisfactory than Josie Pye's companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,
LINE 167: each with an inch of Queen's color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned
LINE 168: proudly to her coat. As Josie was not "speaking" to Jane just then she
LINE 169: had to subside into comparative harmlessness.
LINE 170: "Well," said Jane with a sigh, "I feel as if I'd lived many moons since
LINE 171: the morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old
LINE 172: professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply
LINE 173: couldn't settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the
LINE 174: traces of tears. If you've been crying _do_ own up. It will restore my
LINE 175: self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I
LINE 176: don't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?
LINE 177: You'll give me a teeny piece, won't you? Thank you. It has the real
LINE 178: Avonlea flavor."
LINE 179: Ruby, perceiving the Queen's calendar lying on the table, wanted to know
LINE 180: if Anne meant to try for the gold medal.
LINE 181: Anne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.
LINE 182: "Oh, that reminds me," said Josie, "Queen's is to get one of the Avery
LINE 183: scholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his
LINE 184: uncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced
LINE 185: in the Academy tomorrow."
LINE 186: An Avery scholarship! Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the
LINE 187: horizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before
LINE 188: Josie had told the news Anne's highest pinnacle of aspiration had been
LINE 189: a teacher's provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and
LINE 190: perhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning
LINE 191: the Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and
LINE 192: graduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie's words
LINE 193: had died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt
LINE 194: that here her foot was on native heath.
LINE 195: A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his
LINE 196: fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed
LINE 197: among the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,
LINE 198: according to their respective standings. There had been much doubt
LINE 199: whether one would be allotted to Queen's, but the matter was settled at
LINE 200: last, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark
LINE 201: in English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred
LINE 202: and fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder
LINE 203: that Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!
LINE 204: "I'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it," she resolved.
LINE 205: "Wouldn't Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it's delightful to
LINE 206: have ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to
LINE 207: be any end to them--that's the best of it. Just as soon as you attain
LINE 208: to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still. It does
LINE 209: make life so interesting."
