LINE 1: WITH the end of June came the close of the term and the close of Miss
LINE 2: Stacy's rule in Avonlea school. Anne and Diana walked home that
LINE 3: evening feeling very sober indeed. Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore
LINE 4: convincing testimony to the fact that Miss Stacy's farewell words must
LINE 5: have been quite as touching as Mr. Phillips's had been under similar
LINE 6: circumstances three years before. Diana looked back at the schoolhouse
LINE 7: from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.
LINE 8: "It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn't it?" she said
LINE 9: dismally.
LINE 10: "You oughtn't to feel half as badly as I do," said Anne, hunting vainly
LINE 11: for a dry spot on her handkerchief. "You'll be back again next winter,
LINE 12: but I suppose I've left the dear old school forever--if I have good
LINE 13: luck, that is."
LINE 14: "It won't be a bit the same. Miss Stacy won't be there, nor you nor Jane
LINE 15: nor Ruby probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn't bear
LINE 16: to have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven't
LINE 17: we, Anne? It's dreadful to think they're all over."
LINE 18: Two big tears rolled down by Diana's nose.
LINE 19: "If you would stop crying I could," said Anne imploringly. "Just as
LINE 20: soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off
LINE 21: again. As Mrs. Lynde says, 'If you can't be cheerful, be as cheerful as
LINE 22: you can.' After all, I dare say I'll be back next year. This is one
LINE 23: of the times I _know_ I'm not going to pass. They're getting alarmingly
LINE 24: frequent."
LINE 25: "Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave."
LINE 26: "Yes, but those exams didn't make me nervous. When I think of the real
LINE 27: thing you can't imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round
LINE 28: my heart. And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it's so
LINE 29: unlucky. I am _not_ superstitious and I know it can make no difference.
LINE 30: But still I wish it wasn't thirteen."
LINE 31: "I do wish I was going in with you," said Diana. "Wouldn't we have
LINE 32: a perfectly elegant time? But I suppose you'll have to cram in the
LINE 33: evenings."
LINE 34: "No; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. She says
LINE 35: it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not
LINE 36: think about the exams at all and go to bed early. It's good advice, but
LINE 37: I expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think.
LINE 38: Prissy Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her
LINE 39: Entrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up
LINE 40: _at least_ as long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to
LINE 41: ask me to stay at Beechwood while I'm in town."
LINE 42: "You'll write to me while you're in, won't you?"
LINE 43: "I'll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes," promised
LINE 44: Anne.
LINE 45: "I'll be haunting the post office Wednesday," vowed Diana.
LINE 46: Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted
LINE 47: the post office, as agreed, and got her letter.
LINE 48: "Dearest Diana" [wrote Anne],
LINE 49: "Here it is Tuesday night and I'm writing this in the library at
LINE 50: Beechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and
LINE 51: wished so much you were with me. I couldn't 'cram' because I'd promised
LINE 52: Miss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history
LINE 53: as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were
LINE 54: learned.
LINE 55: "This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling
LINE 56: for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands
LINE 57: and they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn't slept
LINE 58: a wink and she didn't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind
LINE 59: of the teacher's course even if I did get through. There are times and
LINE 60: seasons even yet when I don't feel that I've made any great headway in
LINE 61: learning to like Josie Pye!
LINE 62: "When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from
LINE 63: all over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting
LINE 64: on the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth
LINE 65: he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over
LINE 66: and over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt
LINE 67: him, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot
LINE 68: everything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts
LINE 69: firmly in their proper place!
LINE 70: "When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and
LINE 71: I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of
LINE 72: the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if
LINE 73: I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear
LINE 74: across the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English
LINE 75: examination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled
LINE 76: around as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly
LINE 77: as I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green
LINE 78: Gables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began
LINE 79: beating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I
LINE 80: knew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.
LINE 81: "At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in
LINE 82: the afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully
LINE 83: mixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,
LINE 84: Diana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it
LINE 85: it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my
LINE 86: Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would
LINE 87: recite it from now till tomorrow morning.
LINE 88: "I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody
LINE 89: Spurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in
LINE 90: history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he
LINE 91: was going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a
LINE 92: carpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to
LINE 93: stay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn't.
LINE 94: Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon
LINE 95: I'm always glad I'm a girl and not his sister.
LINE 96: "Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just
LINE 97: discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When
LINE 98: she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had
LINE 99: been with us.
LINE 100: "Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as
LINE 101: Mrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I
LINE 102: fail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I
LINE 103: think I'd rather it didn't go on if I failed!
LINE 104: "Yours devotedly,
LINE 105: "Anne"
LINE 106: The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and
LINE 107: Anne arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of
LINE 108: chastened triumph about her. Diana was over at Green Gables when she
LINE 109: arrived and they met as if they had been parted for years.
LINE 110: "You old darling, it's perfectly splendid to see you back again. It
LINE 111: seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get
LINE 112: along?"
LINE 113: "Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don't know
LINE 114: whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment
LINE 115: that I didn't. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the
LINE 116: dearest, loveliest spot in the world."
LINE 117: "How did the others do?"
LINE 118: "The girls say they know they didn't pass, but I think they did pretty
LINE 119: well. Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!
LINE 120: Moody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he
LINE 121: failed in algebra. But we don't really know anything about it and won't
LINE 122: until the pass list is out. That won't be for a fortnight. Fancy living
LINE 123: a fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake
LINE 124: up until it is over."
LINE 125: Diana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so
LINE 126: she merely said:
LINE 127: "Oh, you'll pass all right. Don't worry."
LINE 128: "I'd rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the
LINE 129: list," flashed Anne, by which she meant--and Diana knew she meant--that
LINE 130: success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of
LINE 131: Gilbert Blythe.
LINE 132: With this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the
LINE 133: examinations. So had Gilbert. They had met and passed each other on the
LINE 134: street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne
LINE 135: had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly
LINE 136: that she had made friends with Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a
LINE 137: little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. She knew
LINE 138: that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she
LINE 139: even knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question
LINE 140: and that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert
LINE 141: would be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if
LINE 142: she failed.
LINE 143: But she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted
LINE 144: to "pass high" for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew.
LINE 145: Matthew had declared to her his conviction that she "would beat the
LINE 146: whole Island." That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to
LINE 147: hope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she
LINE 148: would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew's
LINE 149: kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she
LINE 150: felt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient
LINE 151: grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.
LINE 152: At the end of the fortnight Anne took to "haunting" the post office
LINE 153: also, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the
LINE 154: Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings
LINE 155: as bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert
LINE 156: were not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely
LINE 157: away.
LINE 158: "I haven't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,"
LINE 159: he told Anne. "I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me
LINE 160: suddenly whether I've passed or not."
LINE 161: When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began
LINE 162: to feel that she really couldn't stand the strain much longer. Her
LINE 163: appetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished.
LINE 164: Mrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory
LINE 165: superintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting
LINE 166: Anne's paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her
LINE 167: home from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if
LINE 168: he hadn't better vote Grit at the next election.
LINE 169: But one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window,
LINE 170: for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the
LINE 171: world, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with
LINE 172: flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the
LINE 173: stir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink
LINE 174: from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the
LINE 175: spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying
LINE 176: down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a
LINE 177: fluttering newspaper in her hand.
LINE 178: Anne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The
LINE 179: pass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt
LINE 180: her. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana
LINE 181: came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even
LINE 182: knocking, so great was her excitement.
LINE 183: "Anne, you've passed," she cried, "passed the _very first_--you and
LINE 184: Gilbert both--you're ties--but your name is first. Oh, I'm so proud!"
LINE 185: Diana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly
LINE 186: breathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,
LINE 187: oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her
LINE 188: shaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.
LINE 189: Yes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two
LINE 190: hundred! That moment was worth living for.
LINE 191: "You did just splendidly, Anne," puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently
LINE 192: to sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a
LINE 193: word. "Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes
LINE 194: ago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won't be here
LINE 195: till tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over
LINE 196: like a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon
LINE 197: and all, although he's conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty
LINE 198: well--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through
LINE 199: with three marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as
LINE 200: if she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel
LINE 201: like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were
LINE 202: me I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but
LINE 203: you're as calm and cool as a spring evening."
LINE 204: "I'm just dazzled inside," said Anne. "I want to say a hundred things,
LINE 205: and I can't find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this--yes, I
LINE 206: did too, just once! I let myself think _once_, 'What if I should come out
LINE 207: first?' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to
LINE 208: think I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run
LINE 209: right out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we'll go up the road and
LINE 210: tell the good news to the others."
LINE 211: They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling
LINE 212: hay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at
LINE 213: the lane fence.
LINE 214: "Oh, Matthew," exclaimed Anne, "I've passed and I'm first--or one of the
LINE 215: first! I'm not vain, but I'm thankful."
LINE 216: "Well now, I always said it," said Matthew, gazing at the pass list
LINE 217: delightedly. "I knew you could beat them all easy."
LINE 218: "You've done pretty well, I must say, Anne," said Marilla, trying to
LINE 219: hide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel's critical eye. But that
LINE 220: good soul said heartily:
LINE 221: "I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in
LINE 222: saying it. You're a credit to your friends, Anne, that's what, and we're
LINE 223: all proud of you."
LINE 224: That night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious
LINE 225: little talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open
LINE 226: window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude
LINE 227: and aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it
LINE 228: thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when
LINE 229: she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and
LINE 230: beautiful as maidenhood might desire.
