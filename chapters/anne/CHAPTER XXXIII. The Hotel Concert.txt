LINE 1: PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne," advised Diana
LINE 2: decidedly.
LINE 3: They were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only
LINE 4: twilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless
LINE 5: sky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into
LINE 6: burnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet
LINE 7: summer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway
LINE 8: voices and laughter. But in Anne's room the blind was drawn and the lamp
LINE 9: lighted, for an important toilet was being made.
LINE 10: The east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that
LINE 11: night four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to
LINE 12: the marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept
LINE 13: in, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and
LINE 14: dainty a nest as a young girl could desire.
LINE 15: The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of
LINE 16: Anne's early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams
LINE 17: had kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented
LINE 18: them. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that
LINE 19: softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of
LINE 20: pale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade
LINE 21: tapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few
LINE 22: good pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy's photograph occupied
LINE 23: the place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh
LINE 24: flowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly
LINE 25: perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no "mahogany
LINE 26: furniture," but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a
LINE 27: cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,
LINE 28: a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes
LINE 29: painted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a
LINE 30: low white bed.
LINE 31: Anne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had
LINE 32: got it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all
LINE 33: the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it
LINE 34: along. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir
LINE 35: had been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a
LINE 36: violin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;
LINE 37: and Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to
LINE 38: recite.
LINE 39: As Anne would have said at one time, it was "an epoch in her life," and
LINE 40: she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in
LINE 41: the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his
LINE 42: Anne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather
LINE 43: than admit it, and said she didn't think it was very proper for a lot
LINE 44: of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible
LINE 45: person with them.
LINE 46: Anne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother
LINE 47: Billy in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and
LINE 48: boys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from
LINE 49: town, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.
LINE 50: "Do you really think the organdy will be best?" queried Anne anxiously.
LINE 51: "I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it
LINE 52: certainly isn't so fashionable."
LINE 53: "But it suits you ever so much better," said Diana. "It's so soft
LINE 54: and frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too
LINE 55: dressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you."
LINE 56: Anne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for
LINE 57: notable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much
LINE 58: sought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular
LINE 59: night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was
LINE 60: forever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so
LINE 61: her appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon
LINE 62: Anne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and
LINE 63: combed and adorned to the Queen's taste.
LINE 64: "Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now
LINE 65: for your slippers. I'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids,
LINE 66: and tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don't pull out a single
LINE 67: curl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do
LINE 68: your hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a
LINE 69: Madonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose
LINE 70: just behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for
LINE 71: you."
LINE 72: "Shall I put my pearl beads on?" asked Anne. "Matthew brought me a
LINE 73: string from town last week, and I know he'd like to see them on me."
LINE 74: Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,
LINE 75: and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied
LINE 76: around Anne's slim milk-white throat.
LINE 77: "There's something so stylish about you, Anne," said Diana, with
LINE 78: unenvious admiration. "You hold your head with such an air. I suppose
LINE 79: it's your figure. I am just a dumpling. I've always been afraid of it,
LINE 80: and now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign
LINE 81: myself to it."
LINE 82: "But you have such dimples," said Anne, smiling affectionately into the
LINE 83: pretty, vivacious face so near her own. "Lovely dimples, like little
LINE 84: dents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream
LINE 85: will never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn't
LINE 86: complain. Am I all ready now?"
LINE 87: "All ready," assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt
LINE 88: figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a
LINE 89: much softer face. "Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.
LINE 90: Doesn't she look lovely?"
LINE 91: Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.
LINE 92: "She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I
LINE 93: expect she'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew
LINE 94: with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy's the
LINE 95: most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when
LINE 96: he got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.
LINE 97: Time was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for
LINE 98: Anne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything
LINE 99: off on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,
LINE 100: and Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear
LINE 101: of the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on."
LINE 102: Then Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked,
LINE 103: with that
LINE 104: "One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown"
LINE 105: and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her
LINE 106: girl recite.
LINE 107: "I wonder if it _is_ too damp for my dress," said Anne anxiously.
LINE 108: "Not a bit of it," said Diana, pulling up the window blind. "It's a
LINE 109: perfect night, and there won't be any dew. Look at the moonlight."
LINE 110: "I'm so glad my window looks east into the sun rising," said Anne, going
LINE 111: over to Diana. "It's so splendid to see the morning coming up over those
LINE 112: long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It's new every
LINE 113: morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest
LINE 114: sunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I don't know how
LINE 115: I'll get along without it when I go to town next month."
LINE 116: "Don't speak of your going away tonight," begged Diana. "I don't want to
LINE 117: think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time
LINE 118: this evening. What are you going to recite, Anne? And are you nervous?"
LINE 119: "Not a bit. I've recited so often in public I don't mind at all now.
LINE 120: I've decided to give 'The Maiden's Vow.' It's so pathetic. Laura Spencer
LINE 121: is going to give a comic recitation, but I'd rather make people cry than
LINE 122: laugh."
LINE 123: "What will you recite if they encore you?"
LINE 124: "They won't dream of encoring me," scoffed Anne, who was not without her
LINE 125: own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling
LINE 126: Matthew all about it at the next morning's breakfast table. "There are
LINE 127: Billy and Jane now--I hear the wheels. Come on."
LINE 128: Billy Andrews insisted that Anne should ride on the front seat with him,
LINE 129: so she unwillingly climbed up. She would have much preferred to sit
LINE 130: back with the girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her
LINE 131: heart's content. There was not much of either laughter or chatter
LINE 132: in Billy. He was a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round,
LINE 133: expressionless face, and a painful lack of conversational gifts. But he
LINE 134: admired Anne immensely, and was puffed up with pride over the prospect
LINE 135: of driving to White Sands with that slim, upright figure beside him.
LINE 136: Anne, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally
LINE 137: passing a sop of civility to Billy--who grinned and chuckled and never
LINE 138: could think of any reply until it was too late--contrived to enjoy the
LINE 139: drive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road was full
LINE 140: of buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed
LINE 141: and reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of
LINE 142: light from top to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert
LINE 143: committee, one of whom took Anne off to the performers' dressing room
LINE 144: which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club,
LINE 145: among whom Anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified. Her
LINE 146: dress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now
LINE 147: seemed simple and plain--too simple and plain, she thought, among all
LINE 148: the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her. What were her
LINE 149: pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her?
LINE 150: And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse
LINE 151: flowers the others wore! Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank
LINE 152: miserably into a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at
LINE 153: Green Gables.
LINE 154: It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel,
LINE 155: where she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes,
LINE 156: the perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down
LINE 157: in the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid
LINE 158: time away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink
LINE 159: silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout
LINE 160: lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne
LINE 161: through her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so
LINE 162: scrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl
LINE 163: kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the "country bumpkins"
LINE 164: and "rustic belles" in the audience, languidly anticipating "such fun"
LINE 165: from the displays of local talent on the program. Anne believed that she
LINE 166: would hate that white-lace girl to the end of life.
LINE 167: Unfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the
LINE 168: hotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a
LINE 169: wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems
LINE 170: on her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice
LINE 171: and wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her
LINE 172: selection. Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the
LINE 173: time, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended
LINE 174: she suddenly put her hands over her face. She could never get up and
LINE 175: recite after that--never. Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if
LINE 176: she were only back at Green Gables!
LINE 177: At this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Anne--who did
LINE 178: not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace
LINE 179: girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied
LINE 180: therein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.
LINE 181: She was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each
LINE 182: other's hands in nervous sympathy.
LINE 183: Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as
LINE 184: she had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience
LINE 185: as this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.
LINE 186: Everything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of
LINE 187: ladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of
LINE 188: wealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches
LINE 189: at the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of
LINE 190: friends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless
LINE 191: critics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement
LINE 192: from her "rustic" efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and
LINE 193: miserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness
LINE 194: came over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would
LINE 195: have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,
LINE 196: must ever after be her portion if she did so.
LINE 197: But suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the
LINE 198: audience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending
LINE 199: forward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once
LINE 200: triumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert
LINE 201: was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and
LINE 202: of the effect produced by Anne's slender white form and spiritual face
LINE 203: against a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had
LINE 204: driven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant
LINE 205: and taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if
LINE 206: she had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage
LINE 207: and determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would
LINE 208: not_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,
LINE 209: never, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her
LINE 210: recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of
LINE 211: the room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored
LINE 212: to her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness
LINE 213: she recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were
LINE 214: bursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing
LINE 215: with shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken
LINE 216: by the stout lady in pink silk.
LINE 217: "My dear, you did splendidly," she puffed. "I've been crying like a
LINE 218: baby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to
LINE 219: have you back!"
LINE 220: "Oh, I can't go," said Anne confusedly. "But yet--I must, or Matthew
LINE 221: will be disappointed. He said they would encore me."
LINE 222: "Then don't disappoint Matthew," said the pink lady, laughing.
LINE 223: Smiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,
LINE 224: funny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The
LINE 225: rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.
LINE 226: When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of
LINE 227: an American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her
LINE 228: to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional
LINE 229: elocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that
LINE 230: she had a charming voice and "interpreted" her selections beautifully.
LINE 231: Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had
LINE 232: supper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane
LINE 233: were invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,
LINE 234: but Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear
LINE 235: of some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,
LINE 236: however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into
LINE 237: the calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked
LINE 238: into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.
LINE 239: Oh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!
LINE 240: How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the
LINE 241: sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants
LINE 242: guarding enchanted coasts.
LINE 243: "Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?" sighed Jane, as they drove
LINE 244: away. "I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at
LINE 245: a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and
LINE 246: chicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much
LINE 247: more fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,
LINE 248: although I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it
LINE 249: was better than Mrs. Evans's."
LINE 250: "Oh, no, don't say things like that, Jane," said Anne quickly, "because
LINE 251: it sounds silly. It couldn't be better than Mrs. Evans's, you know, for
LINE 252: she is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack
LINE 253: of reciting. I'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty
LINE 254: well."
LINE 255: "I've a compliment for you, Anne," said Diana. "At least I think it
LINE 256: must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it
LINE 257: was anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a
LINE 258: romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he
LINE 259: is a distinguished artist, and that her mother's cousin in Boston is
LINE 260: married to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard
LINE 261: him say--didn't we, Jane?--'Who is that girl on the platform with the
LINE 262: splendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.' There now,
LINE 263: Anne. But what does Titian hair mean?"
LINE 264: "Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess," laughed Anne. "Titian
LINE 265: was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women."
LINE 266: "_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?" sighed Jane. "They
LINE 267: were simply dazzling. Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?"
LINE 268: "We _are_ rich," said Anne staunchly. "Why, we have sixteen years to our
LINE 269: credit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more
LINE 270: or less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of
LINE 271: things not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had
LINE 272: millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn't change into any
LINE 273: of those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl
LINE 274: and wear a sour look all your life, as if you'd been born turning up
LINE 275: your nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so
LINE 276: stout and short that you'd really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,
LINE 277: with that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully
LINE 278: unhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn't, Jane
LINE 279: Andrews!"
LINE 280: "I _don't_ know--exactly," said Jane unconvinced. "I think diamonds would
LINE 281: comfort a person for a good deal."
LINE 282: "Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by
LINE 283: diamonds all my life," declared Anne. "I'm quite content to be Anne of
LINE 284: Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Matthew gave me as
LINE 285: much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady's jewels."
