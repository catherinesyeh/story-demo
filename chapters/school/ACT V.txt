LINE 1: SCENE I.--The Library
LINE 2: Enter SURFACE and SERVANT
LINE 3: SURFACE. Mr. Stanley! and why should you think I would see him?--you
LINE 4: must know he came to ask something!
LINE 5: SERVANT. Sir--I shouldn't have let him in but that Mr. Rowley came to
LINE 6: the Door with him.
LINE 7: SURFACE. Pshaw!--Blockhead to suppose that I should now be in a Temper
LINE 8: to receive visits from poor Relations!--well why don't you show the
LINE 9: Fellow up?
LINE 10: SERVANT. I will--Sir--Why, Sir--it was not my Fault that Sir Peter
LINE 11: discover'd my Lady----
LINE 12: SURFACE. Go, fool!--
LINE 13: [Exit SERVANT.]
LINE 14: Sure Fortune never play'd a man of my policy such a Trick before--my
LINE 15: character with Sir Peter!--my Hopes with Maria!--destroy'd in a
LINE 16: moment!--I'm in a rare Humour to listen to other People's Distresses!--I
LINE 17: shan't be able to bestow even a benevolent sentiment on Stanley--So!
LINE 18: here--He comes and Rowley with him--I MUST try to recover myself, and
LINE 19: put a little Charity into my Face however.----
LINE 20: [Exit.]
LINE 21: Enter SIR OLIVER and ROWLEY
LINE 22: SIR OLIVER. What! does He avoid us? that was He--was it not?
LINE 23: ROWLEY. It was Sir--but I doubt you are come a little too abruptly--his
LINE 24: Nerves are so weak that the sight of a poor Relation may be too much for
LINE 25: him--I should have gone first to break you to him.
LINE 26: SIR OLIVER. A Plague of his Nerves--yet this is He whom Sir Peter
LINE 27: extolls as a Man of the most Benevolent way of thinking!--
LINE 28: ROWLEY. As to his way of thinking--I can't pretend to decide[,] for, to
LINE 29: do him justice He appears to have as much speculative Benevolence as any
LINE 30: private Gentleman in the Kingdom--though he is seldom so sensual as to
LINE 31: indulge himself in the exercise of it----
LINE 32: SIR OLIVER. Yet [he] has a string of charitable Sentiments I suppose at
LINE 33: his Fingers' ends!--
LINE 34: ROWLEY. Or, rather at his Tongue's end Sir Oliver; for I believe there
LINE 35: is no sentiment he has more faith in than that 'Charity begins at Home.'
LINE 36: SIR OLIVER. And his I presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs
LINE 37: abroad at all.
LINE 38: ROWLEY. I doubt you'll find it so--but He's coming--I mustn't seem to
LINE 39: interrupt you--and you know immediately--as you leave him--I come in to
LINE 40: announce--your arrival in your real Character.
LINE 41: SIR OLIVER. True--and afterwards you'll meet me at Sir Peter's----
LINE 42: ROWLEY. Without losing a moment.
LINE 43: [Exit.]
LINE 44: SIR OLIVER. So--I see he has premeditated a Denial by the Complaisance
LINE 45: of his Features.
LINE 46: Enter SURFACE
LINE 47: SURFACE. Sir--I beg you ten thousand Pardons for keeping--you a moment
LINE 48: waiting--Mr. Stanley--I presume----
LINE 49: SIR OLIVER. At your Service.
LINE 50: SURFACE. Sir--I beg you will do me the honour to sit down--I entreat you
LINE 51: Sir.
LINE 52: SIR OLIVER. Dear Sir there's no occasion--too civil by half!
LINE 53: SURFACE. I have not the Pleasure of knowing you, Mr. Stanley--but I am
LINE 54: extremely happy to see you look so well--you were nearly related to my
LINE 55: mother--I think Mr. Stanley----
LINE 56: SIR OLIVER. I was Sir--so nearly that my present Poverty I fear may do
LINE 57: discredit to her Wealthy Children--else I should not have presumed to
LINE 58: trouble you.--
LINE 59: SURFACE. Dear Sir--there needs no apology--He that is in Distress tho' a
LINE 60: stranger has a right to claim kindred with the wealthy--I am sure I wish
LINE 61: I was of that class, and had it in my power to offer you even a small
LINE 62: relief.
LINE 63: SIR OLIVER. If your Unkle, Sir Oliver were here--I should have a
LINE 64: Friend----
LINE 65: SURFACE. I wish He was Sir, with all my Heart--you should not want an
LINE 66: advocate with him--believe me Sir.
LINE 67: SIR OLIVER. I should not need one--my Distresses would recommend
LINE 68: me.--but I imagined--his Bounty had enabled you to become the agent of
LINE 69: his Charity.
LINE 70: SURFACE. My dear Sir--you are strangely misinformed--Sir Oliver is a
LINE 71: worthy Man, a worthy man--a very worthy sort of Man--but avarice
LINE 72: Mr. Stanley is the vice of age--I will tell you my good Sir in
LINE 73: confidence:--what he has done for me has been a mere--nothing[;] tho'
LINE 74: People I know have thought otherwise and for my Part I never chose to
LINE 75: contradict the Report.
LINE 76: SIR OLIVER. What!--has he never
LINE 77: transmitted--you--Bullion--Rupees--Pagodas!
LINE 78: SURFACE. O Dear Sir--Nothing of the kind--no--no--a few Presents now and
LINE 79: then--china, shawls, congo Tea, Avadavats--and indian Crackers--little
LINE 80: more, believe me.
LINE 81: SIR OLIVER. Here's Gratitude for twelve thousand pounds!--Avadavats and
LINE 82: indian Crackers.
LINE 83: SURFACE. Then my dear--Sir--you have heard, I doubt not, of the
LINE 84: extravagance of my Brother--Sir--there are very few would credit what I
LINE 85: have done for that unfortunate young man.
LINE 86: SIR OLIVER. Not I for one!
LINE 87: SURFACE. The sums I have lent him! indeed--I have been exceedingly to
LINE 88: blame--it was an amiable weakness! however I don't pretend to defend
LINE 89: it--and now I feel it doubly culpable--since it has deprived me of the
LINE 90: power of serving YOU Mr. Stanley as my Heart directs----
LINE 91: SIR OLIVER. Dissembler! Then Sir--you cannot assist me?
LINE 92: SURFACE. At Present it grieves me to say I cannot--but whenever I have
LINE 93: the ability, you may depend upon hearing from me.
LINE 94: SIR OLIVER. I am extremely sorry----
LINE 95: SURFACE. Not more than I am believe me--to pity without the Power to
LINE 96: relieve is still more painful than to ask and be denied----
LINE 97: SIR OLIVER. Kind Sir--your most obedient humble servant.
LINE 98: SURFACE. You leave me deeply affected Mr. Stanley--William--be ready to
LINE 99: open the door----
LINE 100: SIR OLIVER. O, Dear Sir, no ceremony----
LINE 101: SURFACE. Your very obedient----
LINE 102: SIR OLIVER. Your most obsequious----
LINE 103: SURFACE. You may depend on hearing from me whenever I can be of
LINE 104: service----
LINE 105: SIR OLIVER. Sweet Sir--you are too good----
LINE 106: SURFACE. In the mean time I wish you Health and Spirits----
LINE 107: SIR OLIVER. Your ever grateful and perpetual humble Servant----
LINE 108: SURFACE. Sir--yours as sincerely----
LINE 109: SIR OLIVER. Charles!--you are my Heir.
LINE 110: [Exit.]
LINE 111: SURFACE, solus Soh!--This is one bad effect of a good Character--it
LINE 112: invites applications from the unfortunate and there needs no small
LINE 113: degree of address to gain the reputation of Benevolence without
LINE 114: incurring the expence.--The silver ore of pure Charity is an expensive
LINE 115: article in the catalogue of a man's good Qualities--whereas the
LINE 116: sentimental French Plate I use instead of it makes just as good a
LINE 117: shew--and pays no tax.
LINE 118: Enter ROWLEY
LINE 119: ROWLEY. Mr. Surface--your Servant: I was apprehensive of interrupting
LINE 120: you, tho' my Business demands immediate attention--as this Note will
LINE 121: inform you----
LINE 122: SURFACE. Always Happy to see Mr. Rowley--how--Oliver--Surface!--My Unkle
LINE 123: arrived!
LINE 124: ROWLEY. He is indeed--we have just parted--quite well--after a speedy
LINE 125: voyage--and impatient to embrace his worthy Nephew.
LINE 126: SURFACE. I am astonished!--William[!] stop Mr. Stanley, if He's not
LINE 127: gone----
LINE 128: ROWLEY. O--He's out of reach--I believe.
LINE 129: SURFACE. Why didn't you let me know this when you came in together.--
LINE 130: ROWLEY. I thought you had particular--Business--but must be gone to
LINE 131: inform your Brother, and appoint him here to meet his Uncle. He will be
LINE 132: with you in a quarter of an hour----
LINE 133: SURFACE. So he says. Well--I am strangely overjoy'd at his coming--never
LINE 134: to be sure was anything so damn'd unlucky!
LINE 135: ROWLEY. You will be delighted to see how well He looks.
LINE 136: SURFACE. O--I'm rejoiced to hear it--just at this time----
LINE 137: ROWLEY. I'll tell him how impatiently you expect him----
LINE 138: SURFACE. Do--do--pray--give my best duty and affection--indeed, I cannot
LINE 139: express the sensations I feel at the thought of seeing him!--certainly
LINE 140: his coming just at this Time is the cruellest piece of ill Fortune----
LINE 141: [Exeunt.]
LINE 142: SCENE II.--At SIR PETER'S House
LINE 143: Enter MRS. CANDOUR and SERVANT
LINE 144: SERVANT. Indeed Ma'am, my Lady will see nobody at Present.
LINE 145: MRS. CANDOUR. Did you tell her it was her Friend Mrs. Candour----
LINE 146: SERVANT. Yes Ma'am but she begs you will excuse her----
LINE 147: MRS. CANDOUR. Do go again--I shall be glad to see her if it be only for
LINE 148: a moment--for I am sure she must be in great Distress
LINE 149: [exit MAID]
LINE 150: --Dear Heart--how provoking!--I'm not mistress of half the
LINE 151: circumstances!--We shall have the whole affair in the newspapers with
LINE 152: the Names of the Parties at length before I have dropt the story at a
LINE 153: dozen houses.
LINE 154: Enter SIR BENJAMIN
LINE 155: Sir Benjamin you have heard, I suppose----
LINE 156: SIR BENJAMIN. Of Lady Teazle and Mr. Surface----
LINE 157: MRS. CANDOUR. And Sir Peter's Discovery----
LINE 158: SIR BENJAMIN. O the strangest Piece of Business to be sure----
LINE 159: MRS. CANDOUR. Well I never was so surprised in my life!--I am so sorry
LINE 160: for all Parties--indeed,
LINE 161: SIR BENJAMIN. Now I don't Pity Sir Peter at all--he was so
LINE 162: extravagant--partial to Mr. Surface----
LINE 163: MRS. CANDOUR. Mr. Surface!--why 'twas with Charles Lady Teazle was
LINE 164: detected.
LINE 165: SIR BENJAMIN. No such thing Mr. Surface is the gallant.
LINE 166: MRS. CANDOUR. No--no--Charles is the man--'twas Mr. Surface brought Sir
LINE 167: Peter on purpose to discover them----
LINE 168: SIR BENJAMIN. I tell you I have it from one----
LINE 169: MRS. CANDOUR. And I have it from one----
LINE 170: SIR BENJAMIN. Who had it from one who had it----
LINE 171: MRS. CANDOUR. From one immediately--but here comes Lady
LINE 172: Sneerwell--perhaps she knows the whole affair.
LINE 173: Enter LADY SNEERWELL
LINE 174: LADY SNEERWELL. So--my dear Mrs. Candour Here's a sad affair of our
LINE 175: Friend Teazle----
LINE 176: MRS. CANDOUR. Aye my dear Friend, who could have thought it.
LINE 177: LADY SNEERWELL. Well there is no trusting to appearances[;] tho'--indeed
LINE 178: she was always too lively for me.
LINE 179: MRS. CANDOUR. To be sure, her manners were a little too--free--but she
LINE 180: was very young----
LINE 181: LADY SNEERWELL. And had indeed some good Qualities.
LINE 182: MRS. CANDOUR. So she had indeed--but have you heard the Particulars?
LINE 183: LADY SNEERWELL. No--but everybody says that Mr. Surface----
LINE 184: SIR BENJAMIN. Aye there I told you--Mr. Surface was the Man.
LINE 185: MRS. CANDOUR. No--no--indeed the assignation was with Charles----
LINE 186: LADY SNEERWELL. With Charles!--You alarm me Mrs. Candour!
LINE 187: MRS. CANDOUR. Yes--yes He was the Lover--Mr. Surface--do him
LINE 188: justice--was only the Informer.
LINE 189: SIR BENJAMIN. Well I'll not dispute with you Mrs. Candour--but be it
LINE 190: which it may--I hope that Sir Peter's wound will not----
LINE 191: MRS. CANDOUR. Sir Peter's wound! O mercy! I didn't hear a word of their
LINE 192: Fighting----
LINE 193: LADY SNEERWELL. Nor I a syllable!
LINE 194: SIR BENJAMIN. No--what no mention of the Duel----
LINE 195: MRS. CANDOUR. Not a word--
LINE 196: SIR BENJAMIN. O, Lord--yes--yes--they fought before they left the Room.
LINE 197: LADY SNEERWELL. Pray let us hear.
LINE 198: MRS. CANDOUR. Aye--do oblige--us with the Duel----
LINE 199: SIR BENJAMIN. 'Sir'--says Sir Peter--immediately after the Discovery,
LINE 200: 'you are a most ungrateful Fellow.'
LINE 201: MRS. CANDOUR. Aye to Charles----
LINE 202: SIR BENJAMIN. No, no--to Mr. Surface--'a most ungrateful Fellow; and old
LINE 203: as I am, Sir,' says He, 'I insist on immediate satisfaction.'
LINE 204: MRS. CANDOUR. Aye that must have been to Charles for 'tis very unlikely
LINE 205: Mr. Surface should go to fight in his own House.
LINE 206: SIR BENJAMIN. Gad's Life, Ma'am, not at all--giving me immediate
LINE 207: satisfaction--on this, Madam--Lady Teazle seeing Sir Peter in such
LINE 208: Danger--ran out of the Room in strong Hysterics--and Charles after her
LINE 209: calling out for Hartshorn and Water! Then Madam--they began to fight
LINE 210: with Swords----
LINE 211: Enter CRABTREE
LINE 212: CRABTREE. With Pistols--Nephew--I have it from undoubted authority.
LINE 213: MRS. CANDOUR. Oh, Mr. Crabtree then it is all true----
LINE 214: CRABTREE. Too true indeed Ma'am, and Sir Peter Dangerously wounded----
LINE 215: SIR BENJAMIN. By a thrust in second--quite thro' his left side
LINE 216: CRABTREE. By a Bullet lodged in the Thorax----
LINE 217: MRS. CANDOUR. Mercy--on me[!] Poor Sir Peter----
LINE 218: CRABTREE. Yes, ma'am tho' Charles would have avoided the matter if he
LINE 219: could----
LINE 220: MRS. CANDOUR. I knew Charles was the Person----
LINE 221: SIR BENJAMIN. O my Unkle I see knows nothing of the matter----
LINE 222: CRABTREE. But Sir Peter tax'd him with the basest ingratitude----
LINE 223: SIR BENJAMIN. That I told you, you know----
LINE 224: CRABTREE. Do Nephew let me speak--and insisted on immediate----
LINE 225: SIR BENJAMIN. Just as I said----
LINE 226: CRABTREE. Odds life! Nephew allow others to know something too--A Pair
LINE 227: of Pistols lay on the Bureau--for Mr. Surface--it seems, had come home
LINE 228: the Night before late from Salt-Hill where He had been to see the Montem
LINE 229: with a Friend, who has a Son at Eton--so unluckily the Pistols were left
LINE 230: Charged----
LINE 231: SIR BENJAMIN. I heard nothing of this----
LINE 232: CRABTREE. Sir Peter forced Charles to take one and they fired--it seems
LINE 233: pretty nearly together--Charles's shot took Place as I tell you--and Sir
LINE 234: Peter's miss'd--but what is very extraordinary the Ball struck against
LINE 235: a little Bronze Pliny that stood over the Fire Place--grazed out of the
LINE 236: window at a right angle--and wounded the Postman, who was just coming to
LINE 237: the Door with a double letter from Northamptonshire.
LINE 238: SIR BENJAMIN. My Unkle's account is more circumstantial I must
LINE 239: confess--but I believe mine is the true one for all that.
LINE 240: LADY SNEERWELL. I am more interested in this Affair than they
LINE 241: imagine--and must have better information.--
LINE 242: [Exit.]
LINE 243: SIR BENJAMIN. Ah! Lady Sneerwell's alarm is very easily accounted for.--
LINE 244: CRABTREE. Yes yes, they certainly DO say--but that's neither here nor
LINE 245: there.
LINE 246: MRS. CANDOUR. But pray where is Sir Peter at present----
LINE 247: CRABTREE. Oh! they--brought him home and He is now in the House, tho'
LINE 248: the Servants are order'd to deny it----
LINE 249: MRS. CANDOUR. I believe so--and Lady Teazle--I suppose attending him----
LINE 250: CRABTREE. Yes yes--and I saw one of the Faculty enter just before me----
LINE 251: SIR BENJAMIN. Hey--who comes here----
LINE 252: CRABTREE. Oh, this is He--the Physician depend on't.
LINE 253: MRS. CANDOUR. O certainly it must be the Physician and now we shall
LINE 254: know----
LINE 255: Enter SIR OLIVER
LINE 256: CRABTREE. Well, Doctor--what Hopes?
LINE 257: MRS. CANDOUR. Aye Doctor how's your Patient?
LINE 258: SIR BENJAMIN. Now Doctor isn't it a wound with a small sword----
LINE 259: CRABTREE. A bullet lodged in the Thorax--for a hundred!
LINE 260: SIR OLIVER. Doctor!--a wound with a small sword! and a Bullet in the
LINE 261: Thorax!--oon's are you mad, good People?
LINE 262: SIR BENJAMIN. Perhaps, Sir, you are not a Doctor.
LINE 263: SIR OLIVER. Truly Sir I am to thank you for my degree If I am.
LINE 264: CRABTREE. Only a Friend of Sir Peter's then I presume--but, sir, you
LINE 265: must have heard of this accident--
LINE 266: SIR OLIVER. Not a word!
LINE 267: CRABTREE. Not of his being dangerously wounded?
LINE 268: SIR OLIVER. The Devil he is!
LINE 269: SIR BENJAMIN. Run thro' the Body----
LINE 270: CRABTREE. Shot in the breast----
LINE 271: SIR BENJAMIN. By one Mr. Surface----
LINE 272: CRABTREE. Aye the younger.
LINE 273: SIR OLIVER. Hey! what the plague! you seem to differ strangely in your
LINE 274: accounts--however you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded.
LINE 275: SIR BENJAMIN. Oh yes, we agree in that.
LINE 276: CRABTREE. Yes, yes, I believe there can be no doubt in that.
LINE 277: SIR OLIVER. Then, upon my word, for a person in that Situation, he is
LINE 278: the most imprudent man alive--For here he comes walking as if nothing at
LINE 279: all was the matter.
LINE 280: Enter SIR PETER
LINE 281: Odd's heart, sir Peter! you are come in good time I promise you, for we
LINE 282: had just given you over!
LINE 283: SIR BENJAMIN. 'Egad, Uncle this is the most sudden Recovery!
LINE 284: SIR OLIVER. Why, man, what do you do out of Bed with a Small Sword
LINE 285: through your Body, and a Bullet lodg'd in your Thorax?
LINE 286: SIR PETER. A Small Sword and a Bullet--
LINE 287: SIR OLIVER. Aye these Gentlemen would have kill'd you without Law or
LINE 288: Physic, and wanted to dub me a Doctor to make me an accomplice.
LINE 289: SIR PETER. Why! what is all this?
LINE 290: SIR BENJAMIN. We rejoice, Sir Peter, that the Story of the Duel is not
LINE 291: true--and are sincerely sorry for your other Misfortune.
LINE 292: SIR PETER. So--so--all over the Town already! [Aside.]
LINE 293: CRABTREE. Tho', Sir Peter, you were certainly vastly to blame to marry
LINE 294: at all at your years.
LINE 295: SIR PETER. Sir, what Business is that of yours?
LINE 296: MRS. CANDOUR. Tho' Indeed, as Sir Peter made so good a Husband, he's
LINE 297: very much to be pitied.
LINE 298: SIR PETER. Plague on your pity, Ma'am, I desire none of it.
LINE 299: SIR BENJAMIN. However Sir Peter, you must not mind the Laughing and
LINE 300: jests you will meet with on the occasion.
LINE 301: SIR PETER. Sir, I desire to be master in my own house.
LINE 302: CRABTREE. 'Tis no Uncommon Case, that's one comfort.
LINE 303: SIR PETER. I insist on being left to myself, without ceremony,--I insist
LINE 304: on your leaving my house directly!
LINE 305: MRS. CANDOUR. Well, well, we are going and depend on't, we'll make the
LINE 306: best report of you we can.
LINE 307: SIR PETER. Leave my house!
LINE 308: CRABTREE. And tell how hardly you have been treated.
LINE 309: SIR PETER. Leave my House--
LINE 310: SIR BENJAMIN. And how patiently you bear it.
LINE 311: SIR PETER. Friends! Vipers! Furies! Oh that their own Venom would choke
LINE 312: them!
LINE 313: SIR OLIVER. They are very provoking indeed, Sir Peter.
LINE 314: Enter ROWLEY
LINE 315: ROWLEY. I heard high words: what has ruffled you Sir Peter--
LINE 316: SIR PETER. Pshaw what signifies asking--do I ever pass a Day without my
LINE 317: Vexations?
LINE 318: SIR OLIVER. Well I'm not Inquisitive--I come only to tell you, that I
LINE 319: have seen both my Nephews in the manner we proposed.
LINE 320: SIR PETER. A Precious Couple they are!
LINE 321: ROWLEY. Yes and Sir Oliver--is convinced that your judgment was right
LINE 322: Sir Peter.
LINE 323: SIR OLIVER. Yes I find Joseph is Indeed the Man after all.
LINE 324: ROWLEY. Aye as Sir Peter says, He's a man of Sentiment.
LINE 325: SIR OLIVER. And acts up to the Sentiments he professes.
LINE 326: ROWLEY. It certainly is Edification to hear him talk.
LINE 327: SIR OLIVER. Oh, He's a model for the young men of the age! But how's
LINE 328: this, Sir Peter? you don't Join us in your Friend Joseph's Praise as I
LINE 329: expected.
LINE 330: SIR PETER. Sir Oliver, we live in a damned wicked world, and the fewer
LINE 331: we praise the better.
LINE 332: ROWLEY. What do YOU say so, Sir Peter--who were never mistaken in your
LINE 333: Life?
LINE 334: SIR PETER. Pshaw--Plague on you both--I see by your sneering you have
LINE 335: heard--the whole affair--I shall go mad among you!
LINE 336: ROWLEY. Then to fret you no longer Sir Peter--we are indeed acquainted
LINE 337: with it all--I met Lady Teazle coming from Mr. Surface's so humbled,
LINE 338: that she deigned to request ME to be her advocate with you--
LINE 339: SIR PETER. And does Sir Oliver know all too?
LINE 340: SIR OLIVER. Every circumstance!
LINE 341: SIR PETER. What of the closet and the screen--hey[?]
LINE 342: SIR OLIVER. Yes yes--and the little French Milliner. Oh, I have been
LINE 343: vastly diverted with the story! ha! ha! ha!
LINE 344: SIR PETER. 'Twas very pleasant!
LINE 345: SIR OLIVER. I never laugh'd more in my life, I assure you: ha! ha!
LINE 346: SIR PETER. O vastly diverting! ha! ha!
LINE 347: ROWLEY. To be sure Joseph with his Sentiments! ha! ha!
LINE 348: SIR PETER. Yes his sentiments! ha! ha! a hypocritical Villain!
LINE 349: SIR OLIVER. Aye and that Rogue Charles--to pull Sir Peter out of the
LINE 350: closet: ha! ha!
LINE 351: SIR PETER. Ha! ha! 'twas devilish entertaining to be sure--
LINE 352: SIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! Egad, Sir Peter I should like to have seen your Face
LINE 353: when the screen was thrown down--ha! ha!
LINE 354: SIR PETER. Yes, my face when the Screen was thrown down: ha! ha! ha! O I
LINE 355: must never show my head again!
LINE 356: SIR OLIVER. But come--come it isn't fair to laugh at you neither my old
LINE 357: Friend--tho' upon my soul I can't help it--
LINE 358: SIR PETER. O pray don't restrain your mirth on my account: it does not
LINE 359: hurt me at all--I laugh at the whole affair myself--Yes--yes--I
LINE 360: think being a standing Jest for all one's acquaintance a very happy
LINE 361: situation--O yes--and then of a morning to read the Paragraphs about
LINE 362: Mr. S----, Lady T----, and Sir P----, will be so entertaining!--I shall
LINE 363: certainly leave town tomorrow and never look mankind in the Face again!
LINE 364: ROWLEY. Without affectation Sir Peter, you may despise the ridicule of
LINE 365: Fools--but I see Lady Teazle going towards the next Room--I am sure you
LINE 366: must desire a Reconciliation as earnestly as she does.
LINE 367: SIR OLIVER. Perhaps MY being here prevents her coming to you--well I'll
LINE 368: leave honest Rowley to mediate between you; but he must bring you all
LINE 369: presently to Mr. Surface's--where I am now returning--if not to reclaim
LINE 370: a Libertine, at least to expose Hypocrisy.
LINE 371: SIR PETER. Ah! I'll be present at your discovering yourself there with
LINE 372: all my heart; though 'tis a vile unlucky Place for discoveries.
LINE 373: SIR OLIVER. However it is very convenient to the carrying on of my Plot
LINE 374: that you all live so near one another!
LINE 375: [Exit SIR OLIVER.]
LINE 376: ROWLEY. We'll follow--
LINE 377: SIR PETER. She is not coming here you see, Rowley--
LINE 378: ROWLEY. No but she has left the Door of that Room open you
LINE 379: perceive.--see she is in Tears--!
LINE 380: SIR PETER. She seems indeed to wish I should go to her.--how dejected
LINE 381: she appears--
LINE 382: ROWLEY. And will you refrain from comforting her--
LINE 383: SIR PETER. Certainly a little mortification appears very becoming in a
LINE 384: wife--don't you think it will do her good to let her Pine a little.
LINE 385: ROWLEY. O this is ungenerous in you--
LINE 386: SIR PETER. Well I know not what to think--you remember Rowley the Letter
LINE 387: I found of her's--evidently intended for Charles?
LINE 388: ROWLEY. A mere forgery, Sir Peter--laid in your way on Purpose--this is
LINE 389: one of the Points which I intend Snake shall give you conviction on--
LINE 390: SIR PETER. I wish I were once satisfied of that--She looks this
LINE 391: way----what a remarkably elegant Turn of the Head she has! Rowley I'll
LINE 392: go to her--
LINE 393: ROWLEY. Certainly--
LINE 394: SIR PETER. Tho' when it is known that we are reconciled, People will
LINE 395: laugh at me ten times more!
LINE 396: ROWLEY. Let--them laugh--and retort their malice only by showing them
LINE 397: you are happy in spite of it.
LINE 398: SIR PETER. Efaith so I will--and, if I'm not mistaken we may yet be the
LINE 399: happiest couple in the country--
LINE 400: ROWLEY. Nay Sir Peter--He who once lays aside suspicion----
LINE 401: SIR PETER. Hold Master Rowley--if you have any Regard for me--never let
LINE 402: me hear you utter anything like a Sentiment. I have had enough of THEM
LINE 403: to serve me the rest of my Life.
LINE 404: [Exeunt.]
LINE 405: SCENE THE LAST.--The Library
LINE 406: SURFACE and LADY SNEERWELL
LINE 407: LADY SNEERWELL. Impossible! will not Sir Peter immediately be reconciled
LINE 408: to CHARLES? and of consequence no longer oppose his union with MARIA?
LINE 409: the thought is Distraction to me!
LINE 410: SURFACE. Can Passion--furnish a Remedy?
LINE 411: LADY SNEERWELL. No--nor cunning either. O I was a Fool, an Ideot--to
LINE 412: league with such a Blunderer!
LINE 413: SURFACE. Surely Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest Sufferer--yet you see I
LINE 414: bear the accident with Calmness.
LINE 415: LADY SNEERWELL. Because the Disappointment hasn't reached your
LINE 416: HEART--your interest only attached you to Maria--had you felt for
LINE 417: her--what I have for that ungrateful Libertine--neither your Temper nor
LINE 418: Hypocrisy could prevent your showing the sharpness of your Vexation.
LINE 419: SURFACE. But why should your Reproaches fall on me for this
LINE 420: Disappointment?
LINE 421: LADY SNEERWELL. Are not you the cause of it? what had you to bate in
LINE 422: your Pursuit of Maria to pervert Lady Teazle by the way.--had you not a
LINE 423: sufficient field for your Roguery in blinding Sir Peter and supplanting
LINE 424: your Brother--I hate such an avarice of crimes--'tis an unfair monopoly
LINE 425: and never prospers.
LINE 426: SURFACE. Well I admit I have been to blame--I confess I deviated from
LINE 427: the direct Road of wrong but I don't think we're so totally defeated
LINE 428: neither.
LINE 429: LADY SNEERWELL. No!
LINE 430: SURFACE. You tell me you have made a trial of Snake since we met--and
LINE 431: that you still believe him faithful to us--
LINE 432: LADY SNEERWELL. I do believe so.
LINE 433: SURFACE. And that he has undertaken should it be necessary--to swear and
LINE 434: prove that Charles is at this Time contracted by vows and Honour to
LINE 435: your Ladyship--which some of his former letters to you will serve to
LINE 436: support--
LINE 437: LADY SNEERWELL. This, indeed, might have assisted--
LINE 438: SURFACE. Come--come it is not too late yet--but hark! this is probably
LINE 439: my Unkle Sir Oliver--retire to that Room--we'll consult further when
LINE 440: He's gone.--
LINE 441: LADY SNEERWELL. Well but if HE should find you out to--
LINE 442: SURFACE. O I have no fear of that--Sir Peter will hold his tongue for
LINE 443: his own credit sake--and you may depend on't I shall soon Discover Sir
LINE 444: Oliver's weak side!--
LINE 445: LADY SNEERWELL. I have no diffidence of your abilities--only be constant
LINE 446: to one roguery at a time--
LINE 447: [Exit.]
LINE 448: SURFACE. I will--I will--So 'tis confounded hard after such bad Fortune,
LINE 449: to be baited by one's confederate in evil--well at all events
LINE 450: my character is so much better than Charles's, that I
LINE 451: certainly--hey--what!--this is not Sir Oliver--but old Stanley
LINE 452: again!--Plague on't that He should return to teaze me just now--I shall
LINE 453: have Sir Oliver come and find him here--and----
LINE 454: Enter SIR OLIVER
LINE 455: Gad's life, Mr. Stanley--why have you come back to plague me at this
LINE 456: time? you must not stay now upon my word!
LINE 457: SIR OLIVER. Sir--I hear your Unkle Oliver is expected here--and tho' He
LINE 458: has been so penurious to you, I'll try what He'll do for me--
LINE 459: SURFACE. Sir! 'tis impossible for you to stay now--so I must beg----come
LINE 460: any other time and I promise you you shall be assisted.
LINE 461: SIR OLIVER. No--Sir Oliver and I must be acquainted--
LINE 462: SURFACE. Zounds Sir then [I] insist on your quitting the--Room
LINE 463: directly--
LINE 464: SIR OLIVER. Nay Sir----
LINE 465: SURFACE. Sir--I insist on't--here William show this Gentleman out. Since
LINE 466: you compel me Sir--not one moment--this is such insolence.
LINE 467: [Going to push him out.]
LINE 468: Enter CHARLES
LINE 469: CHARLES. Heyday! what's the matter now?--what the Devil have you got
LINE 470: hold of my little Broker here! Zounds--Brother, don't hurt little
LINE 471: Premium. What's the matter--my little Fellow?
LINE 472: SURFACE. So! He has been with you, too, has He--
LINE 473: CHARLES. To be sure He has! Why, 'tis as honest a little----But sure
LINE 474: Joseph you have not been borrowing money too have you?
LINE 475: SURFACE. Borrowing--no!--But, Brother--you know sure we expect Sir
LINE 476: Oliver every----
LINE 477: CHARLES. O Gad, that's true--Noll mustn't find the little Broker here to
LINE 478: be sure--
LINE 479: SURFACE. Yet Mr. Stanley insists----
LINE 480: CHARLES. Stanley--why his name's Premium--
LINE 481: SURFACE. No no Stanley.
LINE 482: CHARLES. No, no--Premium.
LINE 483: SURFACE. Well no matter which--but----
LINE 484: CHARLES. Aye aye Stanley or Premium, 'tis the same thing as you say--for
LINE 485: I suppose He goes by half a hundred Names, besides A. B's at the
LINE 486: Coffee-House. [Knock.]
LINE 487: SURFACE. 'Sdeath--here's Sir Oliver at the Door----Now I beg--Mr.
LINE 488: Stanley----
LINE 489: CHARLES. Aye aye and I beg Mr. Premium----
LINE 490: SIR OLIVER. Gentlemen----
LINE 491: SURFACE. Sir, by Heaven you shall go--
LINE 492: CHARLES. Aye out with him certainly----
LINE 493: SIR OLIVER. This violence----
LINE 494: SURFACE. 'Tis your own Fault.
LINE 495: CHARLES. Out with him to be sure. [Both forcing SIR OLIVER out.]
LINE 496: Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE, LADY TEAZLE, MARIA, and ROWLEY
LINE 497: SIR PETER. My old Friend, Sir Oliver!--hey! what in the name of
LINE 498: wonder!--Here are dutiful Nephews!--assault their Unkle at his first
LINE 499: Visit!
LINE 500: LADY TEAZLE. Indeed Sir Oliver 'twas well we came in to rescue you.
LINE 501: ROWLEY. Truly it was--for I perceive Sir Oliver the character of old
LINE 502: Stanley was no Protection to you.
LINE 503: SIR OLIVER. Nor of Premium either--the necessities of the former could
LINE 504: not extort a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman; and with the other
LINE 505: I stood a chance of faring worse than my Ancestors, and being knocked
LINE 506: down without being bid for.
LINE 507: SURFACE. Charles!
LINE 508: CHARLES. Joseph!
LINE 509: SURFACE. 'Tis compleat!
LINE 510: CHARLES. Very!
LINE 511: SIR OLIVER. Sir Peter--my Friend and Rowley too--look on that elder
LINE 512: Nephew of mine--You know what He has already received from my Bounty and
LINE 513: you know also how gladly I would have look'd on half my Fortune as held
LINE 514: in trust for him--judge then my Disappointment in discovering him to be
LINE 515: destitute of Truth--Charity--and Gratitude--
LINE 516: SIR PETER. Sir Oliver--I should be more surprized at this Declaration,
LINE 517: if I had not myself found him to be selfish--treacherous and
LINE 518: Hypocritical.
LINE 519: LADY TEAZLE. And if the Gentleman pleads not guilty to these pray let
LINE 520: him call ME to his Character.
LINE 521: SIR PETER. Then I believe we need add no more--if He knows himself He
LINE 522: will consider it as the most perfect Punishment that He is known to the
LINE 523: world--
LINE 524: CHARLES. If they talk this way to Honesty--what will they say to ME by
LINE 525: and bye!
LINE 526: SIR OLIVER. As for that Prodigal--his Brother there----
LINE 527: CHARLES. Aye now comes my Turn--the damn'd Family Pictures will ruin
LINE 528: me--
LINE 529: SURFACE. Sir Oliver--Unkle--will you honour me with a hearing--
LINE 530: CHARLES. I wish Joseph now would make one of his long speeches and I
LINE 531: might recollect myself a little--
LINE 532: SIR OLIVER. And I suppose you would undertake to vindicate yourself
LINE 533: entirely--
LINE 534: SURFACE. I trust I could--
LINE 535: SIR OLIVER. Nay--if you desert your Roguery in its Distress and try to
LINE 536: be justified--you have even less principle than I thought you had.--[To
LINE 537: CHARLES SURFACE] Well, Sir--and YOU could JUSTIFY yourself too I
LINE 538: suppose--
LINE 539: CHARLES. Not that I know of, Sir Oliver.
LINE 540: SIR OLIVER. What[!] little Premium has been let too much into the secret
LINE 541: I presume.
LINE 542: CHARLES. True--Sir--but they were Family Secrets, and should not be
LINE 543: mentioned again you know.
LINE 544: ROWLEY. Come Sir Oliver I know you cannot speak of Charles's Follies
LINE 545: with anger.
LINE 546: SIR OLIVER. Odd's heart no more I can--nor with gravity either--Sir
LINE 547: Peter do you know the Rogue bargain'd with me for all his
LINE 548: Ancestors--sold me judges and Generals by the Foot, and Maiden Aunts as
LINE 549: cheap as broken China!
LINE 550: CHARLES. To be sure, Sir Oliver, I did make a little free with the
LINE 551: Family Canvas that's the truth on't:--my Ancestors may certainly rise in
LINE 552: judgment against me there's no denying it--but believe me sincere when I
LINE 553: tell you, and upon my soul I would not say so if I was not--that if I do
LINE 554: not appear mortified at the exposure of my Follies, it is because I
LINE 555: feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction in seeing you, my liberal
LINE 556: benefactor.
LINE 557: SIR OLIVER. Charles--I believe you--give me your hand again: the
LINE 558: ill-looking little fellow over the Couch has made your Peace.
LINE 559: CHARLES. Then Sir--my Gratitude to the original is still encreased.
LINE 560: LADY TEAZLE. [Advancing.] Yet I believe, Sir Oliver, here is one whom
LINE 561: Charles is still more anxious to be reconciled to.
LINE 562: SIR OLIVER. O I have heard of his Attachment there--and, with the young
LINE 563: Lady's Pardon if I construe right that Blush----
LINE 564: SIR PETER. Well--Child--speak your sentiments--you know--we are going to
LINE 565: be reconciled to Charles--
LINE 566: MARIA. Sir--I have little to say--but that I shall rejoice to hear that
LINE 567: He is happy--For me--whatever claim I had to his Affection--I willing
LINE 568: resign to one who has a better title.
LINE 569: CHARLES. How Maria!
LINE 570: SIR PETER. Heyday--what's the mystery now? while he appeared an
LINE 571: incorrigible Rake, you would give your hand to no one else and now that
LINE 572: He's likely to reform I'll warrant You won't have him!
LINE 573: MARIA. His own Heart--and Lady Sneerwell know the cause.
LINE 574: [CHARLES.] Lady Sneerwell!
LINE 575: SURFACE. Brother it is with great concern--I am obliged to speak on
LINE 576: this Point, but my Regard to justice obliges me--and Lady Sneerwell's
LINE 577: injuries can no longer--be concealed--[Goes to the Door.]
LINE 578: Enter LADY SNEERWELL
LINE 579: SIR PETER. Soh! another French milliner egad! He has one in every Room
LINE 580: in the House I suppose--
LINE 581: LADY SNEERWELL. Ungrateful Charles! Well may you be surprised and feel
LINE 582: for the indelicate situation which your Perfidy has forced me into.
LINE 583: CHARLES. Pray Unkle, is this another Plot of yours? for as I have Life I
LINE 584: don't understand it.
LINE 585: SURFACE. I believe Sir there is but the evidence of one Person more
LINE 586: necessary to make it extremely clear.
LINE 587: SIR PETER. And that Person--I imagine, is Mr. Snake--Rowley--you were
LINE 588: perfectly right to bring him with us--and pray let him appear.
LINE 589: ROWLEY. Walk in, Mr. Snake--
LINE 590: Enter SNAKE
LINE 591: I thought his Testimony might be wanted--however it happens unluckily
LINE 592: that He comes to confront Lady Sneerwell and not to support her--
LINE 593: LADY SNEERWELL. A Villain!--Treacherous to me at last! Speak, Fellow,
LINE 594: have you too conspired against me?
LINE 595: SNAKE. I beg your Ladyship--ten thousand Pardons--you paid me extremely
LINE 596: Liberally for the Lie in question--but I unfortunately have been offer'd
LINE 597: double to speak the Truth.
LINE 598: LADY SNEERWELL. The Torments of Shame and Disappointment on you all!
LINE 599: LADY TEAZLE. Hold--Lady Sneerwell--before you go let me thank you for
LINE 600: the trouble you and that Gentleman have taken in writing Letters from me
LINE 601: to Charles and answering them yourself--and let me also request you
LINE 602: to make my Respects to the Scandalous College--of which you are
LINE 603: President--and inform them that Lady Teazle, Licentiate, begs leave to
LINE 604: return the diploma they granted her--as she leaves of[f] Practice and
LINE 605: kills Characters no longer.
LINE 606: LADY SNEERWELL. Provoking--insolent!--may your Husband live these fifty
LINE 607: years!
LINE 608: [Exit.]
LINE 609: SIR PETER. Oons what a Fury----
LINE 610: LADY TEAZLE. A malicious Creature indeed!
LINE 611: SIR PETER. Hey--not for her last wish?--
LINE 612: LADY TEAZLE. O No--
LINE 613: SIR OLIVER. Well Sir, and what have you to say now?
LINE 614: SURFACE. Sir, I am so confounded, to find that Lady Sneerwell could be
LINE 615: guilty of suborning Mr. Snake in this manner to impose on us all that
LINE 616: I know not what to say----however, lest her Revengeful Spirit should
LINE 617: prompt her to injure my Brother I had certainly better follow her
LINE 618: directly.
LINE 619: [Exit.]
LINE 620: SIR PETER. Moral to the last drop!
LINE 621: SIR OLIVER. Aye and marry her Joseph if you can.--Oil and Vinegar
LINE 622: egad:--you'll do very well together.
LINE 623: ROWLEY. I believe we have no more occasion for Mr. Snake at Present--
LINE 624: SNAKE. Before I go--I beg Pardon once for all for whatever uneasiness I
LINE 625: have been the humble instrument of causing to the Parties present.
LINE 626: SIR PETER. Well--well you have made atonement by a good Deed at last--
LINE 627: SNAKE. But I must Request of the Company that it shall never be known--
LINE 628: SIR PETER. Hey!--what the Plague--are you ashamed of having done a right
LINE 629: thing once in your life?
LINE 630: SNAKE. Ah: Sir--consider I live by the Badness of my Character!--I have
LINE 631: nothing but my Infamy to depend on!--and, if it were once known that I
LINE 632: had been betray'd into an honest Action, I should lose every Friend I
LINE 633: have in the world.
LINE 634: SIR OLIVER. Well--well we'll not traduce you by saying anything to your
LINE 635: Praise never fear.
LINE 636: [Exit SNAKE.]
LINE 637: SIR PETER. There's a precious Rogue--Yet that fellow is a Writer and a
LINE 638: Critic.
LINE 639: LADY TEAZLE. See[,] Sir Oliver[,] there needs no persuasion now to
LINE 640: reconcile your Nephew and Maria--
LINE 641: SIR OLIVER. Aye--aye--that's as it should be and egad we'll have the
LINE 642: wedding to-morrow morning--
LINE 643: CHARLES. Thank you, dear Unkle!
LINE 644: SIR PETER. What! you rogue don't you ask the Girl's consent first--
LINE 645: CHARLES. Oh, I have done that a long time--above a minute ago--and She
LINE 646: has look'd yes--
LINE 647: MARIA. For Shame--Charles--I protest Sir Peter, there has not been a
LINE 648: word----
LINE 649: SIR OLIVER. Well then the fewer the Better--may your love for each other
LINE 650: never know--abatement.
LINE 651: SIR PETER. And may you live as happily together as Lady Teazle and
LINE 652: I--intend to do--
LINE 653: CHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am sure you congratulate me and I
LINE 654: suspect too that I owe you much.
LINE 655: SIR OLIVER. You do, indeed, Charles--
LINE 656: ROWLEY. If my Efforts to serve you had not succeeded you would have been
LINE 657: in my debt for the attempt--but deserve to be happy--and you over-repay
LINE 658: me.
LINE 659: SIR PETER. Aye honest Rowley always said you would reform.
LINE 660: CHARLES. Why as to reforming Sir Peter I'll make no promises--and that
LINE 661: I take to be a proof that I intend to set about it--But here shall be my
LINE 662: Monitor--my gentle Guide.--ah! can I leave the Virtuous path those Eyes
LINE 663: illumine?
LINE 664: Tho' thou, dear Maid, should'st wave [waive] thy Beauty's Sway,
LINE 665: --Thou still must Rule--because I will obey:
LINE 666: An humbled fugitive from Folly View,
LINE 667: No sanctuary near but Love and YOU:
LINE 668: You can indeed each anxious Fear remove,
LINE 669: For even Scandal dies if you approve. [To the audience.]
LINE 670: EPILOGUE
LINE 671: BY MR. COLMAN
LINE 672: SPOKEN BY LADY TEAZLE
LINE 673: I, who was late so volatile and gay,
LINE 674: Like a trade-wind must now blow all one way,
LINE 675: Bend all my cares, my studies, and my vows,
LINE 676: To one dull rusty weathercock--my spouse!
LINE 677: So wills our virtuous bard--the motley Bayes
LINE 678: Of crying epilogues and laughing plays!
LINE 679: Old bachelors, who marry smart young wives,
LINE 680: Learn from our play to regulate your lives:
LINE 681: Each bring his dear to town, all faults upon her--
LINE 682: London will prove the very source of honour.
LINE 683: Plunged fairly in, like a cold bath it serves,
LINE 684: When principles relax, to brace the nerves:
LINE 685: Such is my case; and yet I must deplore
LINE 686: That the gay dream of dissipation's o'er.
LINE 687: And say, ye fair! was ever lively wife,
LINE 688: Born with a genius for the highest life,
LINE 689: Like me untimely blasted in her bloom,
LINE 690: Like me condemn'd to such a dismal doom?
LINE 691: Save money--when I just knew how to waste it!
LINE 692: Leave London--just as I began to taste it!
LINE 693: Must I then watch the early crowing cock,
LINE 694: The melancholy ticking of a clock;
LINE 695: In a lone rustic hall for ever pounded,
LINE 696: With dogs, cats, rats, and squalling brats surrounded?
LINE 697: With humble curate can I now retire,
LINE 698: (While good Sir Peter boozes with the squire,)
LINE 699: And at backgammon mortify my soul,
LINE 700: That pants for loo, or flutters at a vole?
LINE 701: Seven's the main! Dear sound that must expire,
LINE 702: Lost at hot cockles round a Christmas fire;
LINE 703: The transient hour of fashion too soon spent,
LINE 704: Farewell the tranquil mind, farewell content!
LINE 705: Farewell the plumed head, the cushion'd tete,
LINE 706: That takes the cushion from its proper seat!
LINE 707: That spirit-stirring drum!--card drums I mean,
LINE 708: Spadille--odd trick--pam--basto--king and queen!
LINE 709: And you, ye knockers, that, with brazen throat,
LINE 710: The welcome visitors' approach denote;
LINE 711: Farewell all quality of high renown,
LINE 712: Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious town!
LINE 713: Farewell! your revels I partake no more,
LINE 714: And Lady Teazle's occupation's o'er!
LINE 715: All this I told our bard; he smiled, and said 'twas clear,
LINE 716: I ought to play deep tragedy next year.
LINE 717: Meanwhile he drew wise morals from his play,
LINE 718: And in these solemn periods stalk'd away:--
LINE 719: "Bless'd were the fair like you; her faults who stopp'd,
LINE 720: And closed her follies when the curtain dropp'd!
LINE 721: No more in vice or error to engage,
LINE 722: Or play the fool at large on life's great stage."
