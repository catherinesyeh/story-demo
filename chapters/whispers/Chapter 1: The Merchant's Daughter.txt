LINE 1: The morning sun filtered through thin paper screens, casting warm patterns
LINE 2: across Mei's room. She had already been up for hours, her hands deftly rolling
LINE 3: and packing silks, folding them into the bamboo chests lined against the wall.
LINE 4: Every delicate wrap was a small rebellion in her mind, a statement of
LINE 5: readiness. Mei longed to be part of her father's journey, to see beyond the
LINE 6: crowded markets and dusty roads of Chang'an. But she knew what her father
LINE 7: thought: a daughter's place was here. With every chest she sealed, the urge to
LINE 8: break free grew stronger.
LINE 9: In the hallway, her father, Zhang, spoke in his hushed, steady voice, listing
LINE 10: instructions for Lin, their loyal servant, and Mei's only confidante. "We need
LINE 11: the finest teas from the market today. And don't forget to pack more dried
LINE 12: fruit." Zhang's attention was fixated on the smallest of details, each one a
LINE 13: testament to his unwavering dedication to his craft. Mei admired his focus, yet
LINE 14: she wanted him to see beyond the endless lists and packed goods, to see her—how
LINE 15: much she wanted to be by his side.
LINE 16: Lin brought Mei a bowl of tea. "You should be careful with your wishes, Mei.
LINE 17: The road is no place for someone of your gentleness." Mei offered a soft smile
LINE 18: in reply, not breaking from her work. "You think I can't handle it?" she asked
LINE 19: playfully, masking her frustration. Lin shook her head with a smirk,
LINE 20: whispering, "One day, you'll show everyone what you're made of, Mei. But
LINE 21: perhaps today is not that day."
LINE 22: Her father stepped into her room, his eyes briefly resting on the bamboo chests
LINE 23: before moving to Mei. "You've done well, daughter," he murmured. She felt a
LINE 24: thrill of pride at his approval, even if it wasn't the kind of approval she
LINE 25: truly sought. Mei hesitated before speaking, daring to push back just a little.
LINE 26: "I could come with you, Father. Help you. I know the teas and the silks. I
LINE 27: could be of use."
LINE 28: Zhang paused, his brows furrowing, and the room grew quiet. "This journey… it
LINE 29: isn't for you, Mei." His voice softened, but the words were immovable, like a
LINE 30: wall standing in her path. Mei nodded, but inside, her longing remained.
LINE 31: The day wore on, but her mind was already far down the dusty roads, dreaming of
LINE 32: adventures her father couldn't quite imagine.
LINE 33: As the afternoon sun began to fade, Mei found herself wandering the outer
LINE 34: courtyard, her steps guided by her restless thoughts. Her heart pounded with
LINE 35: frustration. She had tried to speak with her father again about joining him on
LINE 36: the journey, but each attempt was met with resistance, his protective gaze
LINE 37: lingering on her before he dismissed her ambitions with a wave of his hand.
LINE 38: Mei's hands tightened into fists as she replayed the conversations in her mind.
LINE 39: "He's too protective," she muttered under her breath. The thought of being left
LINE 40: behind gnawed at her, twisting her insides into knots. She was not a child, yet
LINE 41: her father looked at her as though she were still fragile, something to be kept
LINE 42: hidden away from the world's dangers.
LINE 43: Lin approached, sensing Mei's distress. "He just wants you safe," she said
LINE 44: quietly. Mei's gaze dropped, her shoulders heavy with the weight of her
LINE 45: father's concern. "Safe… or controlled?" she murmured. She could feel the tears
LINE 46: prickling at the corners of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall. She was
LINE 47: stronger than that.
LINE 48: "If only he would see that I can take care of myself," she whispered, her voice
LINE 49: wavering. She looked up, her eyes meeting Lin's, a silent plea for
LINE 50: understanding. Lin offered a gentle, comforting smile. "Perhaps one day he
LINE 51: will, Mei. Perhaps one day."
LINE 52: The words did little to comfort her, though. Mei felt as though her life was
LINE 53: slipping through her fingers, like sand in an hourglass, her dreams inching
LINE 54: further and further out of reach with each passing moment. The thought left her
LINE 55: feeling both longing and frustrated, her mind racing with thoughts of freedom
LINE 56: and adventure.
LINE 57: The evening brought with it a surprising announcement. Mei sat in the family
LINE 58: room, her father pacing before her. Zhang looked weary, his gaze distant, as if
LINE 59: he were already halfway down the Silk Road.
LINE 60: He cleared his throat, his expression grave. "Mei," he began, his voice softer
LINE 61: than usual. "Things have changed. I'll need you to come with me on this
LINE 62: journey." The words hung in the air, their weight both thrilling and
LINE 63: terrifying. Mei's heart leaped, a thousand questions surging through her mind.
LINE 64: Her father's eyes softened, and she felt a wave of relief and anticipation wash
LINE 65: over her.
LINE 66: "But Father, you said—" she began, her voice catching in her throat. He nodded,
LINE 67: a reluctant smile breaking through. "Yes, I did. But circumstances demand it."
LINE 68: Mei didn't question him further; she was too afraid he would change his mind.
LINE 69: A family friend, Li Yuan, entered the room, his presence warm and reassuring.
LINE 70: "Your father will need you by his side," he said, his smile kind and
LINE 71: encouraging. He placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "This journey will
LINE 72: shape you, Mei. Remember that."
LINE 73: Mei felt a newfound resolve rising within her, an ember fanned into a roaring
LINE 74: flame. She looked at her father, her eyes brimming with both excitement and
LINE 75: nervousness. For the first time, she felt as though her dreams were within
LINE 76: reach.
LINE 77: The next morning, Mei found herself in the bustling tea market, watching her
LINE 78: father exchange goods with the vendors. She had grown up in this market, its
LINE 79: sounds and smells as familiar as her own breath. Yet today, it felt different,
LINE 80: as though she were seeing it through new eyes.
LINE 81: Zhang moved with precision, his focus unbroken as he inspected bundles of tea
LINE 82: leaves, their rich, earthy scent filling the air. Mei stood by his side, her
LINE 83: curiosity piqued by the sights around her. Her father handed her a small pouch,
LINE 84: its contents a deep green. "This is the finest blend," he said. "It will fetch
LINE 85: a high price on the road."
LINE 86: A familiar face appeared—Lao Feng, a local merchant who had known her family
LINE 87: for years. He greeted them warmly, his presence amiable, his words laced with
LINE 88: humor. "Zhang, it seems your daughter has finally joined us," he said with a
LINE 89: grin, his eyes twinkling with mirth. Mei smiled, feeling a swell of pride at
LINE 90: being included in the conversation.
LINE 91: Zhang nodded, his gaze softening as he looked at Mei. "Yes, she will be by my
LINE 92: side this time." Lao Feng chuckled, patting Zhang's shoulder. "It's about time
LINE 93: you let her see the world."
LINE 94: As they moved through the market, Mei felt a new sense of purpose, her gaze
LINE 95: sharp and observant, drinking in every detail. The world felt vast, and she was
LINE 96: finally stepping into it.
