LINE 1: Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they
LINE 2: walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;—Mr. Elton must compose his
LINE 3: joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton
LINE 4: must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the
LINE 5: place.—Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as
LINE 6: happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.
LINE 7: Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the
LINE 8: world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any
LINE 9: one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and
LINE 10: understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the
LINE 11: little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father
LINE 12: and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston
LINE 13: had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted
LINE 14: communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness
LINE 15: of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.
LINE 16: This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not
LINE 17: afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but
LINE 18: the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was
LINE 19: grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of
LINE 20: Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all
LINE 21: that was enjoyable to the utmost.
LINE 22: The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through
LINE 23: before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to
LINE 24: give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and
LINE 25: Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just
LINE 26: got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his
LINE 27: daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been
LINE 28: almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away
LINE 29: and welcome her dear Emma.
LINE 30: Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather
LINE 31: sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close
LINE 32: to her. The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility
LINE 33: towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but
LINE 34: was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and
LINE 35: solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting
LINE 36: him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal
LINE 37: suggestion of "Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be
LINE 38: possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from
LINE 39: Harriet to me?—Absurd and insufferable!"—Yet he would be so anxious for
LINE 40: her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and
LINE 41: so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her
LINE 42: drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly
LINE 43: like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her
LINE 44: good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for
LINE 45: Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even
LINE 46: positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was
LINE 47: going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.
LINE 48: Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard
LINE 49: enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his
LINE 50: son; she heard the words "my son," and "Frank," and "my son," repeated
LINE 51: several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much
LINE 52: suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but
LINE 53: before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past
LINE 54: that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.
LINE 55: Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never
LINE 56: marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank
LINE 57: Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently
LINE 58: thought—especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor—that if
LINE 59: she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,
LINE 60: character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the
LINE 61: families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be a
LINE 62: match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.
LINE 63: Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not
LINE 64: meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a
LINE 65: situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could
LINE 66: change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided
LINE 67: intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain
LINE 68: degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in
LINE 69: their friends' imaginations.
LINE 70: With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;
LINE 71: but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very
LINE 72: cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly
LINE 73: pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the
LINE 74: substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.—So it proved;—for
LINE 75: when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at
LINE 76: dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of
LINE 77: hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say
LINE 78: to her,
LINE 79: "We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to
LINE 80: see two more here,—your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my
LINE 81: son—and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not
LINE 82: hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting
LINE 83: Frank. I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us
LINE 84: within a fortnight."
LINE 85: Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to
LINE 86: his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their
LINE 87: party quite complete.
LINE 88: "He has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston, "ever since
LINE 89: September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his
LINE 90: own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between
LINE 91: ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.
LINE 92: But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in
LINE 93: January."
LINE 94: "What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so
LINE 95: anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as
LINE 96: yourself."
LINE 97: "Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.
LINE 98: She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not
LINE 99: know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is—(but this is
LINE 100: quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the
LINE 101: other room. There are secrets in all families, you know)—The case is,
LINE 102: that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in
LINE 103: January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If
LINE 104: they are not put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it
LINE 105: is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has
LINE 106: a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite
LINE 107: them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes
LINE 108: to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as
LINE 109: confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of
LINE 110: being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the
LINE 111: upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so
LINE 112: little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their
LINE 113: effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing."
LINE 114: "I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case," replied
LINE 115: Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he
LINE 116: will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."
LINE 117: "Yes—I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at
LINE 118: the place in my life.—She is an odd woman!—But I never allow myself to
LINE 119: speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be very
LINE 120: fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any
LINE 121: body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her
LINE 122: way—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing
LINE 123: to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,
LINE 124: that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it
LINE 125: to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in
LINE 126: general; and the devil of a temper."
LINE 127: Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,
LINE 128: very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet
LINE 129: observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.—
LINE 130: Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be
LINE 131: secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked
LINE 132: of: "for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as
LINE 133: Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.
LINE 134: Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter
LINE 135: stands?"
LINE 136: "Yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.
LINE 137: Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world."
LINE 138: "My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty of
LINE 139: caprice?" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending
LINE 140: before—"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means
LINE 141: so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father
LINE 142: thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in
LINE 143: short, upon her temper. To you—to my two daughters—I may venture on the
LINE 144: truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered
LINE 145: woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare
LINE 146: him."
LINE 147: "Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill," replied
LINE 148: Isabella: "and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without
LINE 149: the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered
LINE 150: person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any
LINE 151: thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she
LINE 152: never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would
LINE 153: have made them!"
LINE 154: Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have
LINE 155: heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve
LINE 156: which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,
LINE 157: would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from
LINE 158: her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own
LINE 159: imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at
LINE 160: present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon
LINE 161: followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,
LINE 162: was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor
LINE 163: conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with
LINE 164: whom he was always comfortable.
LINE 165: While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of
LINE 166: saying,
LINE 167: "And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means
LINE 168: certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,
LINE 169: whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better."
LINE 170: "Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even
LINE 171: if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that
LINE 172: some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine
LINE 173: any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the
LINE 174: Churchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are
LINE 175: jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no
LINE 176: dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine."
LINE 177: "He ought to come," said Emma. "If he could stay only a couple of days,
LINE 178: he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having
LINE 179: it in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall
LINE 180: into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she
LINE 181: wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under
LINE 182: such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if
LINE 183: he likes it."
LINE 184: "One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before
LINE 185: one decides upon what he can do," replied Mrs. Weston. "One ought to
LINE 186: use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one
LINE 187: individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must
LINE 188: not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and
LINE 189: every thing gives way to her."
LINE 190: "But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.
LINE 191: Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,
LINE 192: that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to
LINE 193: whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice
LINE 194: towards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom
LINE 195: she owes nothing at all."
LINE 196: "My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand
LINE 197: a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.
LINE 198: I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it
LINE 199: may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will
LINE 200: be."
LINE 201: Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied, unless
LINE 202: he comes."
LINE 203: "He may have a great deal of influence on some points," continued Mrs.
LINE 204: Weston, "and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is
LINE 205: beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance
LINE 206: of his coming away from them to visit us."
