LINE 1: The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion
LINE 2: for Emma's services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,
LINE 3: as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to
LINE 4: return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked
LINE 5: of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something
LINE 6: extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a
LINE 7: minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to
LINE 8: Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and
LINE 9: finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a
LINE 10: little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on
LINE 11: opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs
LINE 12: which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this
LINE 13: letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal
LINE 14: of marriage. "Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did
LINE 15: not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good
LINE 16: letter, at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her
LINE 17: very much—but she did not know—and so, she was come as fast as she
LINE 18: could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.—" Emma was half-ashamed
LINE 19: of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.
LINE 20: "Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to lose any
LINE 21: thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can."
LINE 22: "Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet. "Pray do. II'd rather you
LINE 23: would."
LINE 24: Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The
LINE 25: style of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not
LINE 26: merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have
LINE 27: disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and
LINE 28: unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of
LINE 29: the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,
LINE 30: liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it,
LINE 31: while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a "Well,
LINE 32: well," and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter? or is it
LINE 33: too short?"
LINE 34: "Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly—"so good
LINE 35: a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his
LINE 36: sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom I
LINE 37: saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if
LINE 38: left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;
LINE 39: no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a
LINE 40: woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural
LINE 41: talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he takes a pen in hand,
LINE 42: his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,
LINE 43: I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a
LINE 44: certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning
LINE 45: it,) than I had expected."
LINE 46: "Well," said the still waiting Harriet;—"well—and—and what shall I do?"
LINE 47: "What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this
LINE 48: letter?"
LINE 49: "Yes."
LINE 50: "But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and
LINE 51: speedily."
LINE 52: "Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."
LINE 53: "Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will
LINE 54: express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your
LINE 55: not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be
LINE 56: unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and
LINE 57: concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will
LINE 58: present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need
LINE 59: not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his
LINE 60: disappointment."
LINE 61: "You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking down.
LINE 62: "Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any
LINE 63: doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been
LINE 64: under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you
LINE 65: feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you
LINE 66: were consulting me only as to the wording of it."
LINE 67: Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:
LINE 68: "You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."
LINE 69: "No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you
LINE 70: advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to
LINE 71: do."
LINE 72: "I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do
LINE 73: with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."
LINE 74: "I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,
LINE 75: contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her
LINE 76: silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that
LINE 77: letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,
LINE 78: "I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as
LINE 79: to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to
LINE 80: refuse him. If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No'
LINE 81: directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful
LINE 82: feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and
LINE 83: older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I
LINE 84: want to influence you."
LINE 85: "Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would
LINE 86: just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you
LINE 87: say, one's mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be
LINE 88: hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say 'No,'
LINE 89: perhaps.—Do you think I had better say 'No?'"
LINE 90: "Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I advise you
LINE 91: either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you
LINE 92: prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most
LINE 93: agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you
LINE 94: hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this
LINE 95: moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive
LINE 96: yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this
LINE 97: moment whom are you thinking of?"
LINE 98: The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away
LINE 99: confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was
LINE 100: still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without
LINE 101: regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong
LINE 102: hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said—
LINE 103: "Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as
LINE 104: well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really
LINE 105: almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?"
LINE 106: "Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just
LINE 107: what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to
LINE 108: myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation
LINE 109: in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have
LINE 110: grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the
LINE 111: consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest
LINE 112: degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not
LINE 113: influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could
LINE 114: not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am
LINE 115: secure of you for ever."
LINE 116: Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her
LINE 117: forcibly.
LINE 118: "You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast. "No, to be
LINE 119: sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have
LINE 120: been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not
LINE 121: give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any
LINE 122: thing in the world."
LINE 123: "Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it
LINE 124: must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.
LINE 125: I must have given you up."
LINE 126: "Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me
LINE 127: never to come to Hartfield any more!"
LINE 128: "Dear affectionate creature!—_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—_You_
LINE 129: confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I
LINE 130: wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must
LINE 131: have a pretty good opinion of himself."
LINE 132: "I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said Harriet, her
LINE 133: conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is very good natured,
LINE 134: and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard
LINE 135: for—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he
LINE 136: may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must
LINE 137: confess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes
LINE 138: to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,
LINE 139: _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.
LINE 140: Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and
LINE 141: his being so much attached to me—and his writing such a letter—but as
LINE 142: to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration."
LINE 143: "Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be
LINE 144: parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or
LINE 145: because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."
LINE 146: "Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too."
LINE 147: Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a "very
LINE 148: true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish
LINE 149: manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that
LINE 150: her husband could write a good letter."
LINE 151: "Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always
LINE 152: happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.
LINE 153: But how shall I do? What shall I say?"
LINE 154: Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and
LINE 155: advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of
LINE 156: her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any
LINE 157: assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every
LINE 158: sentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had
LINE 159: such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace
LINE 160: her up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much
LINE 161: concerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of
LINE 162: what his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious
LINE 163: that they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the
LINE 164: young man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been
LINE 165: accepted after all.
LINE 166: This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business
LINE 167: was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but
LINE 168: Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them
LINE 169: by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the
LINE 170: idea of Mr. Elton.
LINE 171: "I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather a
LINE 172: sorrowful tone.
LINE 173: "Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You
LINE 174: are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to
LINE 175: Abbey-Mill."
LINE 176: "And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy
LINE 177: but at Hartfield."
LINE 178: Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much
LINE 179: surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for
LINE 180: Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a
LINE 181: linen-draper."
LINE 182: "One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher
LINE 183: of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an
LINE 184: opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear
LINE 185: valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she
LINE 186: is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be
LINE 187: among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are
LINE 188: the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained
LINE 189: themselves."
LINE 190: Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that
LINE 191: people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly
LINE 192: cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards
LINE 193: the rejected Mr. Martin.
LINE 194: "Now he has got my letter," said she softly. "I wonder what they are
LINE 195: all doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will be
LINE 196: unhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much."
LINE 197: "Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
LINE 198: employed," cried Emma. "At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing
LINE 199: your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful
LINE 200: is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,
LINE 201: allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."
LINE 202: "My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street."
LINE 203: "Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest
LINE 204: Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till
LINE 205: just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this
LINE 206: evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,
LINE 207: it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those
LINE 208: pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm
LINE 209: prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy
LINE 210: their imaginations all are!"
LINE 211: Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.
