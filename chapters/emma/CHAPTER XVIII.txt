LINE 1: Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near,
LINE 2: Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of
LINE 3: excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, to his "very great
LINE 4: mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of
LINE 5: coming to Randalls at no distant period."
LINE 6: Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in
LINE 7: fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man
LINE 8: had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever
LINE 9: expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by
LINE 10: any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,
LINE 11: and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and
LINE 12: sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three
LINE 13: months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better
LINE 14: weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay
LINE 15: considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.
LINE 16: These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a
LINE 17: more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of
LINE 18: excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was
LINE 19: to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.
LINE 20: Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about
LINE 21: Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at
LINE 22: Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted,
LINE 23: rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was
LINE 24: desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self, she
LINE 25: took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as
LINE 26: warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally
LINE 27: belong to their friendship.
LINE 28: She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite
LINE 29: as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather
LINE 30: more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then
LINE 31: proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of
LINE 32: such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of
LINE 33: looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the
LINE 34: sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the
LINE 35: Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement
LINE 36: with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was
LINE 37: taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making
LINE 38: use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.
LINE 39: "The Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley, coolly;
LINE 40: "but I dare say he might come if he would."
LINE 41: "I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;
LINE 42: but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."
LINE 43: "I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a
LINE 44: point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."
LINE 45: "How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you
LINE 46: suppose him such an unnatural creature?"
LINE 47: "I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting
LINE 48: that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very
LINE 49: little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who
LINE 50: have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural
LINE 51: than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are
LINE 52: proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish
LINE 53: too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have
LINE 54: contrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is
LINE 55: he?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as
LINE 56: much as that. It is impossible."
LINE 57: "That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your
LINE 58: own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the
LINE 59: difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers
LINE 60: to manage."
LINE 61: "It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty
LINE 62: should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want
LINE 63: money—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so
LINE 64: much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts
LINE 65: in the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or
LINE 66: other. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can
LINE 67: leave the Churchills."
LINE 68: "Yes, sometimes he can."
LINE 69: "And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever
LINE 70: there is any temptation of pleasure."
LINE 71: "It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate
LINE 72: knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior
LINE 73: of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that
LINE 74: family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.
LINE 75: Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew
LINE 76: can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can
LINE 77: at others."
LINE 78: "There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and
LINE 79: that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and
LINE 80: resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his
LINE 81: father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he
LINE 82: wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at
LINE 83: once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—'Every sacrifice of mere
LINE 84: pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but
LINE 85: I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my
LINE 86: failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I
LINE 87: shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'—If he would say so to her at
LINE 88: once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no
LINE 89: opposition made to his going."
LINE 90: "No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made to his
LINE 91: coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to
LINE 92: use!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you
LINE 93: have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite
LINE 94: to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to
LINE 95: the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for
LINE 96: him!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as
LINE 97: loud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?"
LINE 98: "Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.
LINE 99: He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of
LINE 100: course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do
LINE 101: him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the
LINE 102: people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients
LINE 103: can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that
LINE 104: they could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his
LINE 105: father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as
LINE 106: well as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his
LINE 107: father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their
LINE 108: hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.
LINE 109: Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in
LINE 110: this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their
LINE 111: little minds would bend to his."
LINE 112: "I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but
LINE 113: where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they
LINE 114: have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as
LINE 115: great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were
LINE 116: to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's
LINE 117: situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been
LINE 118: recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The
LINE 119: Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would
LINE 120: have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.
LINE 121: To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into
LINE 122: perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and
LINE 123: regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,
LINE 124: as you can have, without being so equal, under particular
LINE 125: circumstances, to act up to it."
LINE 126: "Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal
LINE 127: exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."
LINE 128: "Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to
LINE 129: understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly
LINE 130: opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his
LINE 131: life."
LINE 132: "Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first
LINE 133: occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the
LINE 134: will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of
LINE 135: following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for
LINE 136: the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he
LINE 137: ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in
LINE 138: their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their
LINE 139: side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there
LINE 140: would have been no difficulty now."
LINE 141: "We shall never agree about him," cried Emma; "but that is nothing
LINE 142: extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:
LINE 143: I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,
LINE 144: though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,
LINE 145: complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's
LINE 146: perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some
LINE 147: advantages, it will secure him many others."
LINE 148: "Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of
LINE 149: leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely
LINE 150: expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine
LINE 151: flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade
LINE 152: himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of
LINE 153: preserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right
LINE 154: to complain. His letters disgust me."
LINE 155: "Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else."
LINE 156: "I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a
LINE 157: woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's
LINE 158: place, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her
LINE 159: account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly
LINE 160: feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he
LINE 161: would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he
LINE 162: did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of
LINE 163: considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to
LINE 164: herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in
LINE 165: French, not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good
LINE 166: manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy
LINE 167: towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about
LINE 168: him."
LINE 169: "You seem determined to think ill of him."
LINE 170: "Me!—not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I do not
LINE 171: want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his
LINE 172: merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely
LINE 173: personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,
LINE 174: plausible manners."
LINE 175: "Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure
LINE 176: at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and
LINE 177: agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the
LINE 178: bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his
LINE 179: coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the
LINE 180: parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest—one object of
LINE 181: curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak
LINE 182: of nobody else."
LINE 183: "You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him
LINE 184: conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a
LINE 185: chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."
LINE 186: "My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of
LINE 187: every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally
LINE 188: agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;
LINE 189: and so on to every body, having that general information on all
LINE 190: subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,
LINE 191: just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;
LINE 192: that is my idea of him."
LINE 193: "And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he turn out any
LINE 194: thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!
LINE 195: at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company—the great man—the
LINE 196: practised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make
LINE 197: every body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to
LINE 198: be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like
LINE 199: fools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could
LINE 200: not endure such a puppy when it came to the point."
LINE 201: "I will say no more about him," cried Emma, "you turn every thing to
LINE 202: evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no
LINE 203: chance of agreeing till he is really here."
LINE 204: "Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced."
LINE 205: "But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love
LINE 206: for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour."
LINE 207: "He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another," said
LINE 208: Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately
LINE 209: talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should
LINE 210: be angry.
LINE 211: To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a
LINE 212: different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of
LINE 213: mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the
LINE 214: high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she
LINE 215: had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the
LINE 216: merit of another.
