LINE 1: Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea
LINE 2: he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three
LINE 3: companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of
LINE 4: the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty
LINE 5: and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at
LINE 6: last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in
LINE 7: very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and
LINE 8: Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,
LINE 9: with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.
LINE 10: Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the
LINE 11: expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late
LINE 12: improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his
LINE 13: making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most
LINE 14: friendly smiles.
LINE 15: He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,
LINE 16: lovely, amiable friend. "Did she know?—had she heard any thing about
LINE 17: her, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must
LINE 18: confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably." And
LINE 19: in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much
LINE 20: attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the
LINE 21: terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.
LINE 22: But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if
LINE 23: he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than
LINE 24: on Harriet's—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than
LINE 25: that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great
LINE 26: earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber
LINE 27: again, for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture
LINE 28: into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and
LINE 29: though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its
LINE 30: proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude
LINE 31: about her. She was vexed. It did appear—there was no concealing
LINE 32: it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of
LINE 33: Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!
LINE 34: and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.
LINE 35: Weston to implore her assistance, "Would not she give him her
LINE 36: support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss
LINE 37: Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss
LINE 38: Smith's disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a
LINE 39: promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?"
LINE 40: "So scrupulous for others," he continued, "and yet so careless for
LINE 41: herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and
LINE 42: yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore
LINE 43: throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I
LINE 44: some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid."
LINE 45: Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an
LINE 46: address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right
LINE 47: of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked
LINE 48: and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the
LINE 49: purpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she
LINE 50: thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,
LINE 51: removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.
LINE 52: She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did
LINE 53: another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room
LINE 54: from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information
LINE 55: of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,
LINE 56: with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.
LINE 57: Woodhouse:
LINE 58: "This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.
LINE 59: Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way
LINE 60: through a storm of snow."
LINE 61: Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else
LINE 62: had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,
LINE 63: and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and
LINE 64: Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his
LINE 65: son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.
LINE 66: "I admired your resolution very much, sir," said he, "in venturing out
LINE 67: in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.
LINE 68: Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit;
LINE 69: and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow
LINE 70: can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one
LINE 71: is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the
LINE 72: other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before
LINE 73: midnight."
LINE 74: Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he
LINE 75: had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it
LINE 76: should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his
LINE 77: hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely
LINE 78: to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid
LINE 79: they would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,
LINE 80: that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost
LINE 81: good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,
LINE 82: calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,
LINE 83: every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the
LINE 84: consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.
LINE 85: "What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?" was Mr.
LINE 86: Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.
LINE 87: To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her
LINE 88: representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of
LINE 89: their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.
LINE 90: His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being
LINE 91: blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full
LINE 92: in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for
LINE 93: adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was
LINE 94: eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at
LINE 95: Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all
LINE 96: the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.
LINE 97: "You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said she; "I
LINE 98: dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if
LINE 99: we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at
LINE 100: all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my
LINE 101: shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing
LINE 102: that gives me cold."
LINE 103: "Indeed!" replied he. "Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most
LINE 104: extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing
LINE 105: does give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home,
LINE 106: I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses."
LINE 107: Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.
LINE 108: Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could
LINE 109: not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;
LINE 110: and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had
LINE 111: left the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,
LINE 112: came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to
LINE 113: examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty
LINE 114: in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour
LINE 115: hence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury
LINE 116: road—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly
LINE 117: enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,
LINE 118: but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its
LINE 119: being soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with
LINE 120: him in there being nothing to apprehend.
LINE 121: To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were
LINE 122: scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who was
LINE 123: immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous
LINE 124: constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be
LINE 125: appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at
LINE 126: Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in
LINE 127: returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe
LINE 128: to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,
LINE 129: Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—
LINE 130: "Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"
LINE 131: "I am ready, if the others are."
LINE 132: "Shall I ring the bell?"
LINE 133: "Yes, do."
LINE 134: And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes
LINE 135: more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his
LINE 136: own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and
LINE 137: happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
LINE 138: The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such
LINE 139: occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.
LINE 140: Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of
LINE 141: alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the
LINE 142: discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. "He was
LINE 143: afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella
LINE 144: would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.
LINE 145: He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together
LINE 146: as they could;" and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very
LINE 147: slow and wait for the other carriage.
LINE 148: Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he
LINE 149: did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;
LINE 150: so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second
LINE 151: carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,
LINE 152: and that they were to have a tête-à-tête drive. It would not have been
LINE 153: the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,
LINE 154: previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to
LINE 155: him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but
LINE 156: one. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had
LINE 157: been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he
LINE 158: would want to be talking nonsense.
LINE 159: To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was
LINE 160: immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of
LINE 161: the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had
LINE 162: they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she
LINE 163: found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and
LINE 164: Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the
LINE 165: precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well
LINE 166: known, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but
LINE 167: flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and
LINE 168: unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,
LINE 169: very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It
LINE 170: really was so. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent
LINE 171: diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself
LINE 172: _her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say
LINE 173: it all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to
LINE 174: restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must
LINE 175: be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to
LINE 176: the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the
LINE 177: playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she
LINE 178: replied,
LINE 179: "I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget
LINE 180: yourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be
LINE 181: happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please."
LINE 182: "Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!"—And
LINE 183: he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful
LINE 184: pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,
LINE 185: "Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account
LINE 186: for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak
LINE 187: either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough
LINE 188: to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."
LINE 189: But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at
LINE 190: all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and
LINE 191: having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and
LINE 192: slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but
LINE 193: acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he
LINE 194: resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a
LINE 195: favourable answer.
LINE 196: As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his
LINE 197: inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,
LINE 198: replied,
LINE 199: "It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself
LINE 200: too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can
LINE 201: express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last
LINE 202: month, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit
LINE 203: of observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness
LINE 204: of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,
LINE 205: sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such
LINE 206: professions."
LINE 207: "Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this?—Miss
LINE 208: Smith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my
LINE 209: existence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never
LINE 210: cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has
LINE 211: fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very
LINE 212: sorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who
LINE 213: can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my
LINE 214: honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of
LINE 215: you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one
LINE 216: else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has
LINE 217: been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot
LINE 218: really, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be
LINE 219: insinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me."
LINE 220: It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of
LINE 221: all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely
LINE 222: overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence
LINE 223: being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he
LINE 224: tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed—
LINE 225: "Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting
LINE 226: silence. It confesses that you have long understood me."
LINE 227: "No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing. So far from having
LINE 228: long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect
LINE 229: to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you
LINE 230: should have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther
LINE 231: from my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of
LINE 232: her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been
LINE 233: very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were
LINE 234: not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you
LINE 235: judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you
LINE 236: have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss
LINE 237: Smith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?"
LINE 238: "Never, madam," cried he, affronted in his turn: "never, I assure you.
LINE 239: _I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of
LINE 240: girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her
LINE 241: extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object
LINE 242: to—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,
LINE 243: quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal
LINE 244: alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my
LINE 245: visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement
LINE 246: I received—"
LINE 247: "Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely
LINE 248: mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my
LINE 249: friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common
LINE 250: acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake
LINE 251: ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might
LINE 252: have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,
LINE 253: probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you
LINE 254: are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I
LINE 255: trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at
LINE 256: present."
LINE 257: He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite
LINE 258: supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually
LINE 259: deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,
LINE 260: for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If
LINE 261: there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate
LINE 262: awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the
LINE 263: little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage
LINE 264: turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,
LINE 265: all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another
LINE 266: syllable passed.—Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good
LINE 267: night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under
LINE 268: indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to
LINE 269: Hartfield.
LINE 270: There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who had
LINE 271: been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage
LINE 272: Lane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in
LINE 273: strange hands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as
LINE 274: if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.
LINE 275: John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and
LINE 276: attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her
LINE 277: father, as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of
LINE 278: gruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the
LINE 279: day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,
LINE 280: except herself.—But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and
LINE 281: it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till
LINE 282: the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet
LINE 283: reflection.
