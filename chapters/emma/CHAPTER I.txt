LINE 1: Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and
LINE 2: happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
LINE 3: existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
LINE 4: little to distress or vex her.
LINE 5: She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,
LINE 6: indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,
LINE 7: been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had
LINE 8: died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance
LINE 9: of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman
LINE 10: as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
LINE 11: Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a
LINE 12: governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly
LINE 13: of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even
LINE 14: before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess,
LINE 15: the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any
LINE 16: restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they
LINE 17: had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached,
LINE 18: and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's
LINE 19: judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.
LINE 20: The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having
LINE 21: rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too
LINE 22: well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to
LINE 23: her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so
LINE 24: unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with
LINE 25: her.
LINE 26: Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any
LINE 27: disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's
LINE 28: loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this
LINE 29: beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any
LINE 30: continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father
LINE 31: and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to
LINE 32: cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after
LINE 33: dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she
LINE 34: had lost.
LINE 35: The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was
LINE 36: a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and
LINE 37: pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with
LINE 38: what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and
LINE 39: promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want
LINE 40: of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her
LINE 41: past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had
LINE 42: taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had
LINE 43: devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed
LINE 44: her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of
LINE 45: gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,
LINE 46: the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed
LINE 47: Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a
LINE 48: dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such
LINE 49: as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing
LINE 50: all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and
LINE 51: peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of
LINE 52: hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had
LINE 53: such an affection for her as could never find fault.
LINE 54: How was she to bear the change?—It was true that her friend was going
LINE 55: only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the
LINE 56: difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a
LINE 57: Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and
LINE 58: domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual
LINE 59: solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.
LINE 60: He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.
LINE 61: The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had
LINE 62: not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;
LINE 63: for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind
LINE 64: or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though
LINE 65: everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable
LINE 66: temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.
LINE 67: Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being
LINE 68: settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily
LINE 69: reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled
LINE 70: through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from
LINE 71: Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,
LINE 72: and give her pleasant society again.
LINE 73: Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,
LINE 74: to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and
LINE 75: name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were
LINE 76: first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many
LINE 77: acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but
LINE 78: not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for
LINE 79: even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but
LINE 80: sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,
LINE 81: and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He
LINE 82: was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was
LINE 83: used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.
LINE 84: Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was
LINE 85: by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could
LINE 86: ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a
LINE 87: match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor
LINE 88: too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able
LINE 89: to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he
LINE 90: was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for
LINE 91: herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she
LINE 92: had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and
LINE 93: chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but
LINE 94: when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had
LINE 95: said at dinner,
LINE 96: "Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that
LINE 97: Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"
LINE 98: "I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a
LINE 99: good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a
LINE 100: good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for
LINE 101: ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her
LINE 102: own?"
LINE 103: "A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own?
LINE 104: This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my
LINE 105: dear."
LINE 106: "How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We
LINE 107: shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding
LINE 108: visit very soon."
LINE 109: "My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could
LINE 110: not walk half so far."
LINE 111: "No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,
LINE 112: to be sure."
LINE 113: "The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a
LINE 114: little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our
LINE 115: visit?"
LINE 116: "They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have
LINE 117: settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last
LINE 118: night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going
LINE 119: to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only
LINE 120: doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,
LINE 121: papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you
LINE 122: mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!"
LINE 123: "I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not
LINE 124: have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am
LINE 125: sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken
LINE 126: girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always
LINE 127: curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you
LINE 128: have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock
LINE 129: of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an
LINE 130: excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor
LINE 131: to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes
LINE 132: over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will
LINE 133: be able to tell her how we all are."
LINE 134: Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and
LINE 135: hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through
LINE 136: the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The
LINE 137: backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards
LINE 138: walked in and made it unnecessary.
LINE 139: Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not
LINE 140: only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly
LINE 141: connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived
LINE 142: about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,
LINE 143: and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their
LINE 144: mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after
LINE 145: some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were
LINE 146: well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.
LINE 147: Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which
LINE 148: always did him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and
LINE 149: her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.
LINE 150: Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,
LINE 151: to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must
LINE 152: have had a shocking walk."
LINE 153: "Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I
LINE 154: must draw back from your great fire."
LINE 155: "But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not
LINE 156: catch cold."
LINE 157: "Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."
LINE 158: "Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain
LINE 159: here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at
LINE 160: breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding."
LINE 161: "By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what
LINE 162: sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my
LINE 163: congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you
LINE 164: all behave? Who cried most?"
LINE 165: "Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."
LINE 166: "Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say
LINE 167: 'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it
LINE 168: comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it
LINE 169: must be better to have only one to please than two."
LINE 170: "Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome
LINE 171: creature!" said Emma playfully. "That is what you have in your head, I
LINE 172: know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."
LINE 173: "I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse, with
LINE 174: a sigh. "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."
LINE 175: "My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.
LINE 176: Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only
LINE 177: myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a
LINE 178: joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another."
LINE 179: Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults
LINE 180: in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and
LINE 181: though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it
LINE 182: would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him
LINE 183: really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by
LINE 184: every body.
LINE 185: "Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I meant no
LINE 186: reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons
LINE 187: to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be
LINE 188: a gainer."
LINE 189: "Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass—"you want to hear about the
LINE 190: wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved
LINE 191: charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:
LINE 192: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that
LINE 193: we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting
LINE 194: every day."
LINE 195: "Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father. "But, Mr.
LINE 196: Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am
LINE 197: sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for."
LINE 198: Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. "It is
LINE 199: impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr.
LINE 200: Knightley. "We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could
LINE 201: suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's
LINE 202: advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's
LINE 203: time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to
LINE 204: her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow
LINE 205: herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor
LINE 206: must be glad to have her so happily married."
LINE 207: "And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma, "and a
LINE 208: very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match,
LINE 209: you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in
LINE 210: the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,
LINE 211: may comfort me for any thing."
LINE 212: Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, "Ah! my
LINE 213: dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for
LINE 214: whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more
LINE 215: matches."
LINE 216: "I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for
LINE 217: other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such
LINE 218: success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry
LINE 219: again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who
LINE 220: seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied
LINE 221: either in his business in town or among his friends here, always
LINE 222: acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend
LINE 223: a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.
LINE 224: Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a
LINE 225: promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the
LINE 226: uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the
LINE 227: subject, but I believed none of it.
LINE 228: "Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met
LINE 229: with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted
LINE 230: away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from
LINE 231: Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the
LINE 232: match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this
LINE 233: instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off
LINE 234: match-making."
LINE 235: "I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'" said Mr. Knightley.
LINE 236: "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately
LINE 237: spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring
LINE 238: about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But
LINE 239: if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,
LINE 240: means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I
LINE 241: think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were
LINE 242: to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then
LINE 243: afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are
LINE 244: you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be
LINE 245: said."
LINE 246: "And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I
LINE 247: pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is
LINE 248: never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor
LINE 249: word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so
LINE 250: entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;
LINE 251: but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and
LINE 252: the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given
LINE 253: many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might
LINE 254: not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield
LINE 255: enough to comprehend that."
LINE 256: "A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,
LINE 257: unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their
LINE 258: own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than
LINE 259: good to them, by interference."
LINE 260: "Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others," rejoined
LINE 261: Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. "But, my dear, pray do not
LINE 262: make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family
LINE 263: circle grievously."
LINE 264: "Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.
LINE 265: Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in
LINE 266: Highbury who deserves him—and he has been here a whole year, and has
LINE 267: fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have
LINE 268: him single any longer—and I thought when he was joining their hands
LINE 269: to-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same
LINE 270: kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is
LINE 271: the only way I have of doing him a service."
LINE 272: "Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good
LINE 273: young man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew
LINE 274: him any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.
LINE 275: That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so
LINE 276: kind as to meet him."
LINE 277: "With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley,
LINE 278: laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better
LINE 279: thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish
LINE 280: and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a
LINE 281: man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself."
