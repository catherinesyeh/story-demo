LINE 1: Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with
LINE 2: herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual
LINE 3: before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave
LINE 4: looks shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not
LINE 5: repent. On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more
LINE 6: justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next
LINE 7: few days.
LINE 8: The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.
LINE 9: Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common
LINE 10: sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half
LINE 11: sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's
LINE 12: feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and
LINE 13: steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was
LINE 14: soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered,
LINE 15: than as he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage
LINE 16: to the latter.
LINE 17: Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal of
LINE 18: useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few
LINE 19: first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much
LINE 20: easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination
LINE 21: range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge
LINE 22: her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary
LINE 23: pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she
LINE 24: was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing
LINE 25: all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin
LINE 26: quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with
LINE 27: ciphers and trophies.
LINE 28: In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are
LINE 29: not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written
LINE 30: out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint
LINE 31: of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many
LINE 32: more. Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as
LINE 33: Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of
LINE 34: the first order, in form as well as quantity.
LINE 35: Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the
LINE 36: girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting
LINE 37: in. "So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young—he
LINE 38: wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."
LINE 39: And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."
LINE 40: His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did
LINE 41: not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had
LINE 42: desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,
LINE 43: something, he thought, might come from that quarter.
LINE 44: It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury
LINE 45: in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one
LINE 46: whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really
LINE 47: good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she
LINE 48: had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his
LINE 49: recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most
LINE 50: earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe
LINE 51: a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their
LINE 52: two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at
LINE 53: last he recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known
LINE 54: charade,
LINE 55: My first doth affliction denote,
LINE 56: Which my second is destin'd to feel
LINE 57: And my whole is the best antidote
LINE 58: That affliction to soften and heal.—
LINE 59: made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some
LINE 60: pages ago already.
LINE 61: "Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said she;
LINE 62: "that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be
LINE 63: easier to you."
LINE 64: "Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his
LINE 65: life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse"—he
LINE 66: stopt a moment—"or Miss Smith could inspire him."
LINE 67: The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He called
LINE 68: for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table
LINE 69: containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed
LINE 70: to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his
LINE 71: manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.
LINE 72: "I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he. "Being my
LINE 73: friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,
LINE 74: but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."
LINE 75: The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could
LINE 76: understand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found it
LINE 77: easier to meet her eye than her friend's. He was gone the next
LINE 78: moment:—after another moment's pause,
LINE 79: "Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards
LINE 80: Harriet—"it is for you. Take your own."
LINE 81: But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never
LINE 82: loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.
LINE 83: To Miss——
LINE 84: CHARADE.
LINE 85: My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
LINE 86: Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
LINE 87: Another view of man, my second brings,
LINE 88: Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!
LINE 89: But ah! united, what reverse we have!
LINE 90: Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown;
LINE 91: Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
LINE 92: And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
LINE 93: Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,
LINE 94: May its approval beam in that soft eye!
LINE 95: She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through
LINE 96: again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then
LINE 97: passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,
LINE 98: while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope
LINE 99: and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse
LINE 100: charades. _Courtship_—a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This
LINE 101: is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly—'Pray, Miss Smith,
LINE 102: give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my
LINE 103: intentions in the same glance.'
LINE 104: May its approval beam in that soft eye!
LINE 105: Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye—of all epithets, the
LINE 106: justest that could be given.
LINE 107: Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.
LINE 108: Humph—Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in
LINE 109: love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the
LINE 110: benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life
LINE 111: you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade
LINE 112: indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon
LINE 113: now."
LINE 114: She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,
LINE 115: which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the
LINE 116: eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.
LINE 117: "What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?—what can it be? I have not an idea—I
LINE 118: cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find
LINE 119: it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is
LINE 120: it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was—and who could be the young
LINE 121: lady. Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?
LINE 122: And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
LINE 123: Can it be Neptune?
LINE 124: Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!
LINE 125: Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one
LINE 126: syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!
LINE 127: Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"
LINE 128: "Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking
LINE 129: of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a
LINE 130: friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.
LINE 131: For Miss ———, read Miss Smith.
LINE 132: My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,
LINE 133: Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.
LINE 134: That is _court_.
LINE 135: Another view of man, my second brings;
LINE 136: Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!
LINE 137: That is _ship_;—plain as it can be.—Now for the cream.
LINE 138: But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!
LINE 139: Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown.
LINE 140: Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,
LINE 141: And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
LINE 142: A very proper compliment!—and then follows the application, which I
LINE 143: think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in
LINE 144: comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of
LINE 145: its being written for you and to you."
LINE 146: Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read the
LINE 147: concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not
LINE 148: speak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.
LINE 149: Emma spoke for her.
LINE 150: "There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,"
LINE 151: said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions. You
LINE 152: are his object—and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I
LINE 153: thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now,
LINE 154: it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my
LINE 155: wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet,
LINE 156: just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that
LINE 157: has happened. I could never tell whether an attachment between you and
LINE 158: Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its
LINE 159: eligibility have really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I
LINE 160: congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an
LINE 161: attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating. This is a
LINE 162: connexion which offers nothing but good. It will give you every thing
LINE 163: that you want—consideration, independence, a proper home—it will fix
LINE 164: you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to
LINE 165: me, and confirm our intimacy for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance
LINE 166: which can never raise a blush in either of us."
LINE 167: "Dear Miss Woodhouse!"—and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all that Harriet,
LINE 168: with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did
LINE 169: arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear
LINE 170: to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as
LINE 171: she ought. Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.
LINE 172: "Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore I
LINE 173: suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not
LINE 174: have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,
LINE 175: who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He
LINE 176: is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses—'To Miss ———.'
LINE 177: Dear me, how clever!—Could it really be meant for me?"
LINE 178: "I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a
LINE 179: certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to the
LINE 180: play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by
LINE 181: matter-of-fact prose."
LINE 182: "It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure, a
LINE 183: month ago, I had no more idea myself!—The strangest things do take
LINE 184: place!"
LINE 185: "When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted—they do indeed—and
LINE 186: really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so
LINE 187: evidently, so palpably desirable—what courts the pre-arrangement of
LINE 188: other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.
LINE 189: You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one
LINE 190: another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying
LINE 191: will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a
LINE 192: something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right
LINE 193: direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.
LINE 194: The course of true love never did run smooth—
LINE 195: A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that
LINE 196: passage."
LINE 197: "That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,—me, of all people,
LINE 198: who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very
LINE 199: handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,
LINE 200: quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body
LINE 201: says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;
LINE 202: that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so
LINE 203: excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has
LINE 204: ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back
LINE 205: to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!—The two Abbots and
LINE 206: I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he
LINE 207: was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look
LINE 208: through herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look
LINE 209: too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he
LINE 210: looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."
LINE 211: "This is an alliance which, whoever—whatever your friends may be, must
LINE 212: be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we
LINE 213: are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to
LINE 214: see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives
LINE 215: every assurance of it;—if they wish to have you settled in the same
LINE 216: country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will
LINE 217: be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the
LINE 218: common phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the
LINE 219: respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy
LINE 220: them."
LINE 221: "Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You
LINE 222: understand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the
LINE 223: other. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have
LINE 224: made any thing like it."
LINE 225: "I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it
LINE 226: yesterday."
LINE 227: "I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read."
LINE 228: "I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."
LINE 229: "It is as long again as almost all we have had before."
LINE 230: "I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such
LINE 231: things in general cannot be too short."
LINE 232: Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory
LINE 233: comparisons were rising in her mind.
LINE 234: "It is one thing," said she, presently—her cheeks in a glow—"to have
LINE 235: very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is
LINE 236: any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you
LINE 237: must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like
LINE 238: this."
LINE 239: Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's
LINE 240: prose.
LINE 241: "Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet—"these two last!—But how shall I
LINE 242: ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?—Oh! Miss
LINE 243: Woodhouse, what can we do about that?"
LINE 244: "Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare
LINE 245: say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will
LINE 246: pass between us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall
LINE 247: chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me."
LINE 248: "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful
LINE 249: charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good."
LINE 250: "Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should
LINE 251: not write it into your book."
LINE 252: "Oh! but those two lines are"—
LINE 253: —"The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for private
LINE 254: enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,
LINE 255: because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its
LINE 256: meaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a
LINE 257: very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend
LINE 258: upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better
LINE 259: than his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,
LINE 260: or neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can
LINE 261: be no possible reflection on you."
LINE 262: Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so
LINE 263: as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a
LINE 264: declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree
LINE 265: of publicity.
LINE 266: "I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said she.
LINE 267: "Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longer it
LINE 268: lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you
LINE 269: will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him
LINE 270: so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any
LINE 271: thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of
LINE 272: gallantry towards us all!—You must let me read it to him."
LINE 273: Harriet looked grave.
LINE 274: "My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You
LINE 275: will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too
LINE 276: quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning
LINE 277: which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little
LINE 278: tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not
LINE 279: have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me
LINE 280: than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has
LINE 281: encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over
LINE 282: this charade."
LINE 283: "Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please."
LINE 284: Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the
LINE 285: recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears, how does
LINE 286: your book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?"
LINE 287: "Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A
LINE 288: piece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose,
LINE 289: by a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied
LINE 290: it in."
LINE 291: She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and
LINE 292: distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every
LINE 293: part as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had
LINE 294: foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.
LINE 295: "Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.
LINE 296: 'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can
LINE 297: easily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so
LINE 298: prettily, but you, Emma."
LINE 299: Emma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very
LINE 300: tender sigh, he added,
LINE 301: "Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother
LINE 302: was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can
LINE 303: remember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard
LINE 304: me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are
LINE 305: several.
LINE 306: Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,
LINE 307: Kindled a flame I yet deplore,
LINE 308: The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,
LINE 309: Though of his near approach afraid,
LINE 310: So fatal to my suit before.
LINE 311: And that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all
LINE 312: the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it."
LINE 313: "Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the
LINE 314: Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know."
LINE 315: "Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.
LINE 316: Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.
LINE 317: The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being
LINE 318: christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here
LINE 319: next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what
LINE 320: room there will be for the children?"
LINE 321: "Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always
LINE 322: has;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you
LINE 323: know. Why should there be any change?"
LINE 324: "I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since
LINE 325: last Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John Knightley's being a
LINE 326: lawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away
LINE 327: from us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss
LINE 328: Taylor here!"
LINE 329: "She will not be surprized, papa, at least."
LINE 330: "I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I
LINE 331: first heard she was going to be married."
LINE 332: "We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is
LINE 333: here."
LINE 334: "Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is
LINE 335: coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing."
LINE 336: "It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of
LINE 337: necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we
LINE 338: ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time
LINE 339: they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be
LINE 340: taken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim
LINE 341: this Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him,
LINE 342: than with us."
LINE 343: "It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be
LINE 344: anywhere but at Hartfield."
LINE 345: Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his
LINE 346: brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat
LINE 347: musing a little while, and then said,
LINE 348: "But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so
LINE 349: soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to
LINE 350: stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well."
LINE 351: "Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do
LINE 352: not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her
LINE 353: husband."
LINE 354: This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse
LINE 355: could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected
LINE 356: by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she
LINE 357: immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
LINE 358: "Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my
LINE 359: brother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the
LINE 360: children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder
LINE 361: which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"
LINE 362: "Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be
LINE 363: to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."
LINE 364: "I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not."
LINE 365: "Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the
LINE 366: eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,
LINE 367: is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that
LINE 368: the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I
LINE 369: thought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They
LINE 370: are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will
LINE 371: come and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit
LINE 372: of string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives
LINE 373: were only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with
LINE 374: them very often."
LINE 375: "He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so very gentle
LINE 376: yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not
LINE 377: think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they
LINE 378: misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an
LINE 379: affectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate
LINE 380: father. The children are all fond of him."
LINE 381: "And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a
LINE 382: very frightful way!"
LINE 383: "But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such
LINE 384: enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of
LINE 385: their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other."
LINE 386: "Well, I cannot understand it."
LINE 387: "That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot
LINE 388: understand the pleasures of the other."
LINE 389: Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in
LINE 390: preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this
LINE 391: inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could
LINE 392: receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in
LINE 393: his the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and
LINE 394: she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible
LINE 395: reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made
LINE 396: up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest
LINE 397: degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give
LINE 398: way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his
LINE 399: dining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised him
LINE 400: conditionally to come.
LINE 401: Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend
LINE 402: on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she
LINE 403: re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the
LINE 404: paper from the table, she returned it—
LINE 405: "Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;
LINE 406: thank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have
LINE 407: ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not
LINE 408: take it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first
LINE 409: eight lines."
LINE 410: Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked
LINE 411: rather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about
LINE 412: "honour,"—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open
LINE 413: on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the
LINE 414: view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,
LINE 415: "You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must
LINE 416: not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's
LINE 417: approbation while he writes with such gallantry."
LINE 418: "I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating
LINE 419: a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation in saying—at least if
LINE 420: my friend feels at all as _I_ do—I have not the smallest doubt that,
LINE 421: could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at
LINE 422: the book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as
LINE 423: the proudest moment of his life."
LINE 424: After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think
LINE 425: it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a
LINE 426: sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to
LINE 427: laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and
LINE 428: the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.
