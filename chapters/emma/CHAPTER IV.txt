LINE 1: Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick
LINE 2: and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,
LINE 3: and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance
LINE 4: increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking
LINE 5: companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.
LINE 6: In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never
LINE 7: went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed
LINE 8: him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.
LINE 9: Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had
LINE 10: ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet
LINE 11: Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,
LINE 12: would be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,
LINE 13: as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her
LINE 14: kind designs.
LINE 15: Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful
LINE 16: disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be
LINE 17: guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was
LINE 18: very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of
LINE 19: appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want
LINE 20: of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.
LINE 21: Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the
LINE 22: young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required.
LINE 23: Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could
LINE 24: never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different
LINE 25: sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was
LINE 26: the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.
LINE 27: Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.
LINE 28: Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.
LINE 29: Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who
LINE 30: were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell
LINE 31: every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma
LINE 32: was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in
LINE 33: the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet
LINE 34: had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just
LINE 35: what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.
LINE 36: Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the
LINE 37: school in general, formed naturally a great part of the
LINE 38: conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of
LINE 39: Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied
LINE 40: her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with
LINE 41: them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe
LINE 42: the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her
LINE 43: talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and
LINE 44: enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much
LINE 45: exultation of Mrs. Martin's having "_two_ parlours, two very good
LINE 46: parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's
LINE 47: drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived
LINE 48: five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of
LINE 49: them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch
LINE 50: cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it
LINE 51: should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome
LINE 52: summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to
LINE 53: drink tea:—a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen
LINE 54: people."
LINE 55: For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate
LINE 56: cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings
LINE 57: arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and
LINE 58: daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it
LINE 59: appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was
LINE 60: always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing
LINE 61: something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.
LINE 62: Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little
LINE 63: friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were
LINE 64: not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.
LINE 65: With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and
LINE 66: meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,
LINE 67: and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to
LINE 68: speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry
LINE 69: evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very
LINE 70: good-humoured and obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in
LINE 71: order to bring her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was
LINE 72: of them, and in every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his
LINE 73: shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.
LINE 74: She was very fond of singing. He could sing a little himself. She
LINE 75: believed he was very clever, and understood every thing. He had a very
LINE 76: fine flock, and, while she was with them, he had been bid more for his
LINE 77: wool than any body in the country. She believed every body spoke well
LINE 78: of him. His mother and sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had
LINE 79: told her one day (and there was a blush as she said it,) that it was
LINE 80: impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she was sure,
LINE 81: whenever he married, he would make a good husband. Not that she
LINE 82: _wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.
LINE 83: "Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma. "You know what you are about."
LINE 84: "And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send
LINE 85: Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose—the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever
LINE 86: seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three
LINE 87: teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with
LINE 88: her."
LINE 89: "Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of
LINE 90: his own business? He does not read?"
LINE 91: "Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good
LINE 92: deal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the
LINE 93: Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the
LINE 94: window seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an
LINE 95: evening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of
LINE 96: the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the
LINE 97: Vicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The
LINE 98: Children of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I
LINE 99: mentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he
LINE 100: can."
LINE 101: The next question was—
LINE 102: "What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"
LINE 103: "Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at
LINE 104: first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,
LINE 105: after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now
LINE 106: and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to
LINE 107: Kingston. He has passed you very often."
LINE 108: "That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having
LINE 109: any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,
LINE 110: is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are
LINE 111: precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to
LINE 112: do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest
LINE 113: me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.
LINE 114: But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,
LINE 115: as much above my notice as in every other he is below it."
LINE 116: "To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed
LINE 117: him; but he knows you very well indeed—I mean by sight."
LINE 118: "I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,
LINE 119: indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine
LINE 120: his age to be?"
LINE 121: "He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the
LINE 122: 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference—which is very odd."
LINE 123: "Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is
LINE 124: perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as
LINE 125: they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would
LINE 126: probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort
LINE 127: of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it
LINE 128: might be very desirable."
LINE 129: "Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"
LINE 130: "Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are
LINE 131: not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune
LINE 132: entirely to make—cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever
LINE 133: money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of
LINE 134: the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his
LINE 135: stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may
LINE 136: be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised
LINE 137: any thing yet."
LINE 138: "To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no
LINE 139: indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks
LINE 140: of taking a boy another year."
LINE 141: "I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does
LINE 142: marry;—I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife—for though his
LINE 143: sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected
LINE 144: to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you
LINE 145: to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly
LINE 146: careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a
LINE 147: gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station
LINE 148: by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people
LINE 149: who would take pleasure in degrading you."
LINE 150: "Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,
LINE 151: and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any
LINE 152: body can do."
LINE 153: "You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I
LINE 154: would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be
LINE 155: independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you
LINE 156: permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to
LINE 157: have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if
LINE 158: you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you
LINE 159: may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted
LINE 160: with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter,
LINE 161: without education."
LINE 162: "To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body
LINE 163: but what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However,
LINE 164: I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall
LINE 165: not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great
LINE 166: regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very
LINE 167: sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But
LINE 168: if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not
LINE 169: visit her, if I can help it."
LINE 170: Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no
LINE 171: alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,
LINE 172: but she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no
LINE 173: serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly
LINE 174: arrangement of her own.
LINE 175: They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the
LINE 176: Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at
LINE 177: her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was
LINE 178: not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few
LINE 179: yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye
LINE 180: sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very
LINE 181: neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no
LINE 182: other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she
LINE 183: thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet's
LINE 184: inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily
LINE 185: noticed her father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.
LINE 186: Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.
LINE 187: They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be
LINE 188: kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,
LINE 189: and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to
LINE 190: compose.
LINE 191: "Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a
LINE 192: chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not
LINE 193: think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls
LINE 194: most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.
LINE 195: He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot
LINE 196: it, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!
LINE 197: Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think
LINE 198: of him? Do you think him so very plain?"
LINE 199: "He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing
LINE 200: compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect
LINE 201: much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so
LINE 202: very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a
LINE 203: degree or two nearer gentility."
LINE 204: "To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not so genteel
LINE 205: as real gentlemen."
LINE 206: "I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been
LINE 207: repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you
LINE 208: must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At
LINE 209: Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred
LINE 210: men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in
LINE 211: company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very
LINE 212: inferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever
LINE 213: thought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?
LINE 214: Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward
LINE 215: look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to
LINE 216: be wholly unmodulated as I stood here."
LINE 217: "Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air
LINE 218: and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.
LINE 219: But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"
LINE 220: "Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to
LINE 221: compare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with
LINE 222: _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the
LINE 223: only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston
LINE 224: and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their
LINE 225: manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being
LINE 226: silent. You must see the difference."
LINE 227: "Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old
LINE 228: man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."
LINE 229: "Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person
LINE 230: grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not
LINE 231: be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or
LINE 232: awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later
LINE 233: age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.
LINE 234: Weston's time of life?"
LINE 235: "There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather solemnly.
LINE 236: "But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,
LINE 237: vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of
LINE 238: nothing but profit and loss."
LINE 239: "Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."
LINE 240: "How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the
LINE 241: circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.
LINE 242: He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing
LINE 243: else—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to
LINE 244: do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very
LINE 245: rich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb
LINE 246: _us_."
LINE 247: "I wonder he did not remember the book"—was all Harriet's answer, and
LINE 248: spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be
LINE 249: safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her
LINE 250: next beginning was,
LINE 251: "In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr.
LINE 252: Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be
LINE 253: more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,
LINE 254: almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,
LINE 255: because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to
LINE 256: be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding
LINE 257: sort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,
LINE 258: and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to
LINE 259: set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I
LINE 260: think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as
LINE 261: a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He
LINE 262: seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know
LINE 263: whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,
LINE 264: Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are
LINE 265: softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to
LINE 266: please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"
LINE 267: She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from
LINE 268: Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,
LINE 269: and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.
LINE 270: Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young
LINE 271: farmer out of Harriet's head. She thought it would be an excellent
LINE 272: match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her
LINE 273: to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body
LINE 274: else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any
LINE 275: body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had
LINE 276: entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to
LINE 277: Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of
LINE 278: its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the
LINE 279: gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of
LINE 280: any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.
LINE 281: He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient
LINE 282: income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known
LINE 283: to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him
LINE 284: as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any
LINE 285: deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.
LINE 286: She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful
LINE 287: girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was
LINE 288: foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be little
LINE 289: doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual
LINE 290: weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a
LINE 291: young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned
LINE 292: very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,
LINE 293: there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense
LINE 294: with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding
LINE 295: about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered
LINE 296: by Mr. Elton's admiration.
