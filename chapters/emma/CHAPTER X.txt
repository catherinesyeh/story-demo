LINE 1: Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to
LINE 2: prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the
LINE 3: morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who
LINE 4: lived a little way out of Highbury.
LINE 5: Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane
LINE 6: leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street
LINE 7: of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of
LINE 8: Mr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,
LINE 9: about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and
LINE 10: not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had
LINE 11: no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the
LINE 12: present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility
LINE 13: of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing
LINE 14: eyes.—Emma's remark was—
LINE 15: "There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these
LINE 16: days."—Harriet's was—
LINE 17: "Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow
LINE 18: curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."
LINE 19: "I do not often walk this way _now_," said Emma, as they proceeded,
LINE 20: "but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get
LINE 21: intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of
LINE 22: this part of Highbury."
LINE 23: Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and
LINE 24: her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and
LINE 25: probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.
LINE 26: Elton's seeing ready wit in her.
LINE 27: "I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think of any
LINE 28: tolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire
LINE 29: about of his housekeeper—no message from my father."
LINE 30: She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of
LINE 31: some minutes, Harriet thus began again—
LINE 32: "I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or
LINE 33: going to be married! so charming as you are!"—
LINE 34: Emma laughed, and replied,
LINE 35: "My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;
LINE 36: I must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am
LINE 37: not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little
LINE 38: intention of ever marrying at all."
LINE 39: "Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it."
LINE 40: "I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be
LINE 41: tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the
LINE 42: question: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather
LINE 43: not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to
LINE 44: marry, I must expect to repent it."
LINE 45: "Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"—
LINE 46: "I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall
LINE 47: in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been
LINE 48: in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever
LINE 49: shall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a
LINE 50: situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;
LINE 51: consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much
LINE 52: mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never,
LINE 53: never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always
LINE 54: first and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."
LINE 55: "But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"
LINE 56: "That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I
LINE 57: thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so
LINE 58: smiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to
LINE 59: tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry
LINE 60: to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any
LINE 61: likeness, except in being unmarried."
LINE 62: "But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"
LINE 63: "Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty
LINE 64: only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single
LINE 65: woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable
LINE 66: old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of
LINE 67: good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and
LINE 68: pleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much
LINE 69: against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;
LINE 70: for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour
LINE 71: the temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very
LINE 72: small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and
LINE 73: cross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too
LINE 74: good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very
LINE 75: much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty
LINE 76: certainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had
LINE 77: only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away
LINE 78: sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm."
LINE 79: "Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you
LINE 80: grow old?"
LINE 81: "If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great
LINE 82: many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more
LINE 83: in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's
LINE 84: usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they
LINE 85: are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read
LINE 86: more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for
LINE 87: objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the
LINE 88: great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil
LINE 89: to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the
LINE 90: children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be
LINE 91: enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation
LINE 92: that declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and
LINE 93: every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a
LINE 94: parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and
LINE 95: blinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me."
LINE 96: "Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her
LINE 97: a hundred times—but are you acquainted?"
LINE 98: "Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to
LINE 99: Highbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit
LINE 100: with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people
LINE 101: half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane
LINE 102: Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter
LINE 103: from her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go
LINE 104: round and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of
LINE 105: a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears
LINE 106: of nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she
LINE 107: tires me to death."
LINE 108: They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were
LINE 109: superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor
LINE 110: were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her
LINE 111: counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,
LINE 112: could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic
LINE 113: expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had
LINE 114: done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and
LINE 115: always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In
LINE 116: the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she
LINE 117: came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give
LINE 118: comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of
LINE 119: the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,
LINE 120: "These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make
LINE 121: every thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but
LINE 122: these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how
LINE 123: soon it may all vanish from my mind?"
LINE 124: "Very true," said Harriet. "Poor creatures! one can think of nothing
LINE 125: else."
LINE 126: "And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over," said
LINE 127: Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended
LINE 128: the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them
LINE 129: into the lane again. "I do not think it will," stopping to look once
LINE 130: more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still
LINE 131: greater within.
LINE 132: "Oh! dear, no," said her companion.
LINE 133: They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was
LINE 134: passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma
LINE 135: time only to say farther,
LINE 136: "Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good
LINE 137: thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion
LINE 138: has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that
LINE 139: is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we
LINE 140: can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to
LINE 141: ourselves."
LINE 142: Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentleman joined
LINE 143: them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the
LINE 144: first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit
LINE 145: he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what
LINE 146: could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to
LINE 147: accompany them.
LINE 148: "To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thought Emma;
LINE 149: "to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of
LINE 150: love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the
LINE 151: declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else."
LINE 152: Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon
LINE 153: afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one
LINE 154: side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had
LINE 155: not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of
LINE 156: dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,
LINE 157: they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately
LINE 158: stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing
LINE 159: of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the
LINE 160: footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would
LINE 161: follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time
LINE 162: she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the
LINE 163: comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from
LINE 164: the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to
LINE 165: fetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk
LINE 166: to and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would
LINE 167: have been the most natural, had she been acting just then without
LINE 168: design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,
LINE 169: without any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,
LINE 170: involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and
LINE 171: she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a
LINE 172: conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with
LINE 173: animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,
LINE 174: having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw
LINE 175: back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged
LINE 176: to join them.
LINE 177: Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;
LINE 178: and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was
LINE 179: only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at
LINE 180: his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton
LINE 181: cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and
LINE 182: all the dessert.
LINE 183: "This would soon have led to something better, of course," was her
LINE 184: consoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who love; and
LINE 185: any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I
LINE 186: could but have kept longer away!"
LINE 187: They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage
LINE 188: pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the
LINE 189: house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,
LINE 190: and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off
LINE 191: short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged
LINE 192: to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself
LINE 193: to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.
LINE 194: "Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am to
LINE 195: contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I
LINE 196: hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to
LINE 197: stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or
LINE 198: string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."
LINE 199: Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could
LINE 200: exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house
LINE 201: and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they
LINE 202: were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;
LINE 203: behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door
LINE 204: between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to
LINE 205: receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged
LINE 206: to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.
LINE 207: Elton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained
LINE 208: ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she
LINE 209: hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the
LINE 210: adjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It
LINE 211: could be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and
LINE 212: make her appearance.
LINE 213: The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most
LINE 214: favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of
LINE 215: having schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to
LINE 216: the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told
LINE 217: Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;
LINE 218: other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing
LINE 219: serious.
LINE 220: "Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch, and
LINE 221: will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."
LINE 222: Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her
LINE 223: ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been
LINE 224: the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading
LINE 225: them forward to the great event.
