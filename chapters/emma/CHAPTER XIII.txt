LINE 1: There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John
LINE 2: Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning
LINE 3: among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over
LINE 4: what she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had
LINE 5: nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly.
LINE 6: It was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being much too short.
LINE 7: In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their
LINE 8: mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,
LINE 9: there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no
LINE 10: denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr. Woodhouse was
LINE 11: persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of
LINE 12: the party.
LINE 13: How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he
LINE 14: could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually
LINE 15: at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on
LINE 16: that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long
LINE 17: to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for
LINE 18: Harriet also.
LINE 19: Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the
LINE 20: only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early, as well
LINE 21: as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being
LINE 22: consulted in every thing.
LINE 23: The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that
LINE 24: Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent
LINE 25: by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with
LINE 26: a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.
LINE 27: Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma
LINE 28: called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with
LINE 29: regard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat:
LINE 30: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of,
LINE 31: and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which
LINE 32: excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not
LINE 33: speak of her loss without many tears.
LINE 34: Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's
LINE 35: unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much
LINE 36: Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at
LINE 37: last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a
LINE 38: most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had
LINE 39: not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by
LINE 40: Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on
LINE 41: slowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he, on the
LINE 42: rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he
LINE 43: might carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr.
LINE 44: John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two
LINE 45: eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a
LINE 46: country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton
LINE 47: and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and
LINE 48: proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's
LINE 49: complaint;—"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat
LINE 50: about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.
LINE 51: Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often
LINE 52: alarmed her with them." Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as
LINE 53: he exclaimed,
LINE 54: "A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid
LINE 55: infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of
LINE 56: yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.
LINE 57: Why does not Perry see her?"
LINE 58: Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this
LINE 59: excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and
LINE 60: care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she
LINE 61: could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist
LINE 62: than not, she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject,
LINE 63: "It is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like
LINE 64: snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I
LINE 65: should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from
LINE 66: venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel
LINE 67: the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so
LINE 68: great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.
LINE 69: Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me
LINE 70: a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and
LINE 71: what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than
LINE 72: common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night."
LINE 73: Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;
LINE 74: which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind
LINE 75: care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,
LINE 76: he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma,
LINE 77: too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear
LINE 78: him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied
LINE 79: with his muttering acknowledgment of its being "very cold, certainly
LINE 80: very cold," and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from
LINE 81: Randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet
LINE 82: every hour of the evening.
LINE 83: "You do quite right," said she;—"we will make your apologies to Mr. and
LINE 84: Mrs. Weston."
LINE 85: But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly
LINE 86: offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only
LINE 87: objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt
LINE 88: satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had
LINE 89: his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;
LINE 90: never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when
LINE 91: he next looked at her.
LINE 92: "Well," said she to herself, "this is most strange!—After I had got him
LINE 93: off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill
LINE 94: behind!—Most strange indeed!—But there is, I believe, in many men,
LINE 95: especially single men, such an inclination—such a passion for dining
LINE 96: out—a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,
LINE 97: their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing
LINE 98: gives way to it—and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most
LINE 99: valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in
LINE 100: love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must
LINE 101: dine out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see
LINE 102: ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her."
LINE 103: Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him
LINE 104: the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his
LINE 105: manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while
LINE 106: assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her fair
LINE 107: friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting
LINE 108: her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he
LINE 109: sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of
LINE 110: approbation much in his favour.
LINE 111: After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley
LINE 112: began with—
LINE 113: "I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.
LINE 114: Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With
LINE 115: men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to
LINE 116: please, every feature works."
LINE 117: "Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but where there
LINE 118: is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a
LINE 119: great deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he
LINE 120: will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such
LINE 121: perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but
LINE 122: value."
LINE 123: "Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "he seems
LINE 124: to have a great deal of good-will towards you."
LINE 125: "Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you imagining me
LINE 126: to be Mr. Elton's object?"
LINE 127: "Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never
LINE 128: occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration
LINE 129: now."
LINE 130: "Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!"
LINE 131: "I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is
LINE 132: so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your
LINE 133: manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better
LINE 134: look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do."
LINE 135: "I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I
LINE 136: are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on, amusing
LINE 137: herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a
LINE 138: partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of
LINE 139: high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very
LINE 140: well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and
LINE 141: in want of counsel. He said no more.
LINE 142: Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in
LINE 143: spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of
LINE 144: shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his
LINE 145: eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness
LINE 146: of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his
LINE 147: own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it
LINE 148: was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was
LINE 149: severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes
LINE 150: of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of
LINE 151: being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very
LINE 152: white world in a very short time.
LINE 153: Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The
LINE 154: preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of
LINE 155: his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,
LINE 156: which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated
LINE 157: nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the
LINE 158: whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his
LINE 159: discontent.
LINE 160: "A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when he
LINE 161: asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as
LINE 162: this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most
LINE 163: agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest
LINE 164: absurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing
LINE 165: people to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people's not staying
LINE 166: comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an
LINE 167: evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we
LINE 168: should deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing
LINE 169: than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of
LINE 170: the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view
LINE 171: or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter
LINE 172: that he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in
LINE 173: another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said
LINE 174: and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.
LINE 175: Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and
LINE 176: four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering
LINE 177: creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had
LINE 178: at home."
LINE 179: Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no
LINE 180: doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the "Very true, my
LINE 181: love," which must have been usually administered by his travelling
LINE 182: companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any
LINE 183: answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being
LINE 184: quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to
LINE 185: talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening
LINE 186: her lips.
LINE 187: They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.
LINE 188: Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma
LINE 189: thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all
LINE 190: obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities
LINE 191: indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different
LINE 192: account of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while
LINE 193: dressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same—not better."
LINE 194: "_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's," said she presently, "was not so
LINE 195: pleasant as I had hoped—'Not better' was _my_ answer."
LINE 196: His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of
LINE 197: sentiment as he answered.
LINE 198: "Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that
LINE 199: when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing
LINE 200: before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,
LINE 201: by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had
LINE 202: flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew
LINE 203: had been given her in the morning."
LINE 204: Emma smiled and answered—"My visit was of use to the nervous part of
LINE 205: her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it
LINE 206: is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you
LINE 207: probably heard."
LINE 208: "Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—"
LINE 209: "He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow
LINE 210: morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is
LINE 211: impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party
LINE 212: to-day!"
LINE 213: "Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment."
LINE 214: This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really
LINE 215: estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay
LINE 216: when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,
LINE 217: and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
LINE 218: "What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin for
LINE 219: carriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold
LINE 220: with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have
LINE 221: rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced
LINE 222: and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way
LINE 223: unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very
LINE 224: cold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!
LINE 225: snows a little I see."
LINE 226: "Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal of
LINE 227: it."
LINE 228: "Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton. "Quite seasonable; and
LINE 229: extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin
LINE 230: yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly
LINE 231: have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been
LINE 232: much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite
LINE 233: the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body
LINE 234: invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the
LINE 235: worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.
LINE 236: Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not
LINE 237: get away till that very day se'nnight."
LINE 238: Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but
LINE 239: said only, coolly,
LINE 240: "I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."
LINE 241: At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much
LINE 242: astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet
LINE 243: seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
LINE 244: "We are sure of excellent fires," continued he, "and every thing in the
LINE 245: greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;—Mrs. Weston
LINE 246: indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so
LINE 247: hospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where
LINE 248: small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.
LINE 249: Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten
LINE 250: comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,
LINE 251: fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me,
LINE 252: (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your
LINE 253: approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large
LINE 254: parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."
LINE 255: "I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir—I never dine with
LINE 256: any body."
LINE 257: "Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had
LINE 258: been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be
LINE 259: paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great
LINE 260: enjoyment."
LINE 261: "My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed through
LINE 262: the sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."
