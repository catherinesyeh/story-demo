LINE 1: Alex jolted awake in their bed, drenched in sweat. The sunlight streaming
LINE 2: through the curtains felt too bright, too familiar. The clock on the bedside
LINE 3: table read 7:00 a.m., and the radio was playing the same old song. For a
LINE 4: moment, they sat frozen, their heart pounding as they tried to shake off the
LINE 5: remnants of the dream—or was it a dream? The murder, the investigation, Laura
LINE 6: Patel's trembling confession...it had all seemed so real. But as Alex glanced
LINE 7: around their room, everything felt wrong.
LINE 8: The day before was fresh in their memory, yet the quiet hum of the early
LINE 9: morning buzzed with a disorienting sense of déjà vu. Alex rubbed their temples,
LINE 10: trying to piece together their thoughts. Something wasn't right. Hadn't they
LINE 11: already lived through this day?
LINE 12: Throwing back the covers, they moved through their apartment in a daze. It was
LINE 13: as if every object, every detail was exactly as it had been the previous
LINE 14: morning, down to the coffee cup on the kitchen counter. Alex picked it up,
LINE 15: staring at the dark liquid inside, the steam curling lazily into the air.
LINE 16: Everything was the same, and yet it wasn't.
LINE 17: The phone rang, and Alex's stomach twisted in knots. They knew, without
LINE 18: answering, that it was Sam on the other end. Slowly, they reached for the
LINE 19: receiver.
LINE 20: "Harper, we've got a situation. You'll want to get down here."
LINE 21: Same words. Same tone. Same urgency. It was happening again.
LINE 22: "I'll be there," Alex replied, their voice sounding distant even to themselves.
LINE 23: They hung up, staring at the phone in disbelief. Was this some kind of joke? A
LINE 24: sick, twisted joke?
LINE 25: But as they moved through the motions of getting dressed, the creeping sense of
LINE 26: unease grew stronger. The day ahead was a perfect reflection of the day before,
LINE 27: and Alex couldn't shake the feeling that they were trapped in something far
LINE 28: beyond their control. Something was wrong—deeply, unsettlingly wrong—and they
LINE 29: had to figure it out before it drove them mad.
LINE 30: Arriving at the precinct, Alex moved through the familiar hallways, each step
LINE 31: weighed down by the gnawing sensation that they had done this all before. The
LINE 32: precinct bustled with the usual activity, but the faces, the conversations—it
LINE 33: was all too familiar. Alex caught sight of Sam at his desk, flipping through a
LINE 34: file. He looked up as Alex approached, his expression the same as yesterday,
LINE 35: and Alex's heart sank.
LINE 36: "About time you showed up," Sam said, flashing a grin. "The crime scene's
LINE 37: already a circus."
LINE 38: Alex stared at him, their mind racing. Was Sam reliving this too? Did anyone
LINE 39: else feel it? "Sam...didn't we—" Alex stopped, unsure how to phrase it.
LINE 40: "Haven't we already been through this?"
LINE 41: Sam raised an eyebrow, his grin fading slightly. "What are you talking about?
LINE 42: We've got a murder to solve, Alex. You good?"
LINE 43: Alex felt a wave of frustration rise. "I'm fine," they muttered, though their
LINE 44: voice betrayed the lie. The ground beneath their feet felt shaky, unstable.
LINE 45: "Let's just...get to the crime scene."
LINE 46: As they walked side by side, Alex couldn't shake the growing dread. Everything
LINE 47: was unfolding exactly the same as the previous day, down to the smallest
LINE 48: detail. The conversations, the cases being discussed in the bullpen, the coffee
LINE 49: someone had spilled near the front desk—it was all the same. No matter how much
LINE 50: Alex tried to dismiss it, the truth was becoming clearer by the minute.
LINE 51: They were trapped in a loop. And no one else seemed to notice.
LINE 52: Back at the crime scene, Alex stood frozen, staring at the bloodstained carpet
LINE 53: in the luxury apartment. The body was still there, just as it had been
LINE 54: yesterday. Officer Davis was once again by the window, nervously fiddling with
LINE 55: his radio, and Sam was glancing around the room with the same skeptical look on
LINE 56: his face.
LINE 57: It was happening again. The same moment, the same crime, the same motions.
LINE 58: Alex's mind whirled, trying to make sense of it all. Was this real? Had they
LINE 59: lost their grip on reality? Or was something more sinister at play?
LINE 60: "I already ran through this yesterday," Alex muttered under their breath,
LINE 61: moving toward the body. Their hands shook as they examined the crime scene,
LINE 62: their eyes darting to the same details they had noticed before—the glass of
LINE 63: wine, the overturned picture frame, the faint prints on the windowsill. All of
LINE 64: it was the same.
LINE 65: "Alex, you alright?" Sam's voice cut through their thoughts, a thread of
LINE 66: concern woven into his words. "You're acting...off."
LINE 67: Alex's jaw clenched. How could they explain this to Sam? How could they even
LINE 68: begin to explain the impossible? "I'm fine," Alex snapped, though their voice
LINE 69: was far from steady. "I just need...some air."
LINE 70: They stormed out of the apartment, their pulse racing. The cool breeze from the
LINE 71: open balcony hit their face, but it did little to calm their nerves. How was
LINE 72: this happening? How had they woken up to find themselves reliving the same day?
LINE 73: As they stood there, staring out at the city skyline, a realization hit them
LINE 74: like a punch to the gut. If they were trapped in this loop—if the day was
LINE 75: repeating itself—then the choices they made today didn't matter. They could do
LINE 76: whatever they wanted, say whatever they needed to, and nothing would change.
LINE 77: Tomorrow, they would wake up and it would be the same day all over again.
LINE 78: The power of that realization surged through Alex, but with it came fear. What
LINE 79: was causing this? And more importantly, how could they escape?
LINE 80: Back at the precinct, Alex sat in their office, staring blankly at the
LINE 81: paperwork piled on their desk. The clock ticked away the seconds, each one
LINE 82: feeling more surreal than the last. If today was a repeat of yesterday, then
LINE 83: every choice they made now wouldn't carry forward—there were no consequences,
LINE 84: no lasting impact.
LINE 85: But that also meant they had the freedom to experiment, to test the boundaries
LINE 86: of this loop. Maybe, just maybe, they could figure out how to break it.
LINE 87: Alex stood abruptly, their mind racing with possibilities. They needed to see
LINE 88: someone who might understand this, someone outside of the investigation.
LINE 89: Without a second thought, they grabbed their coat and headed out the door,
LINE 90: leaving Sam behind with barely a word.
LINE 91: Their destination: Angela Price, the department's psychiatrist. If anyone could
LINE 92: offer insight into the strange situation Alex found themselves in, it was her.
LINE 93: The drive to Angela's office felt endless, the weight of uncertainty pressing
LINE 94: down on Alex with every passing second. The streets blurred by in a haze, and
LINE 95: by the time they reached the building, Alex's hands were trembling. They had no
LINE 96: idea how to explain this to her, no idea how to make sense of the madness
LINE 97: swirling in their head.
LINE 98: Angela greeted them with her usual calm demeanor, but Alex could see the
LINE 99: concern in her eyes as they sat down across from her. "You seem...unsettled,"
LINE 100: she said gently. "What's going on?"
LINE 101: For a long moment, Alex just stared at her, unsure where to begin. But then the
LINE 102: words came pouring out—disjointed, frantic. "I'm stuck," they said, their voice
LINE 103: breaking. "I'm stuck in the same day. Everything's repeating. I've lived
LINE 104: through this day before."
LINE 105: Angela raised an eyebrow, but her tone remained even. "Are you sure? It sounds
LINE 106: like you might be experiencing déjà vu—"
LINE 107: "No," Alex interrupted, shaking their head. "This is real. I know it is.
LINE 108: Everything...everything's happening the same way, down to the smallest detail.
LINE 109: It's not just déjà vu."
LINE 110: Angela was silent for a long moment, her gaze steady. "Tell me more," she said
LINE 111: quietly, and Alex did. They told her about the crime scene, the conversations
LINE 112: with Sam, the routine that had played out exactly the same as yesterday. And
LINE 113: through it all, Angela listened, her expression unreadable.
LINE 114: When Alex finished, the silence hung heavy in the air. Finally, Angela spoke,
LINE 115: her voice soft but firm. "I'm not sure what's happening, Alex. But whatever it
LINE 116: is, we'll figure it out together."
LINE 117: But Alex wasn't sure if anyone could help them now.
LINE 118: By the time Alex returned to the precinct, their head was spinning with the
LINE 119: weight of their conversation with Angela. She hadn't dismissed their
LINE 120: experience, but she hadn't had any answers either. It was as though Alex was
LINE 121: caught in an invisible web, and every time they tried to pull free, the threads
LINE 122: only tightened around them.
LINE 123: As they walked through the precinct, their eyes caught sight of a familiar
LINE 124: face—Detective Sarah Black, standing near the coffee machine. Her sharp gaze
LINE 125: locked onto Alex the moment they stepped into the room, and a flicker of
LINE 126: suspicion crossed her features.
LINE 127: "You look like hell, Harper," Sarah remarked, her voice laced with that same
LINE 128: condescension Alex had come to expect from her. "Rough night?"
LINE 129: Alex clenched their jaw, resisting the urge to snap back. They didn't have the
LINE 130: energy for a confrontation—not today. "Just a long day," they muttered, moving
LINE 131: past her toward their desk.
LINE 132: But Sarah wasn't finished. She stepped into Alex's path, blocking their way.
LINE 133: "You've been acting strange lately. People are starting to notice. You sure
LINE 134: you're alright?"
LINE 135: Alex felt a surge of irritation rise, but they tamped it down. "I'm fine," they
LINE 136: said through gritted teeth. "I've just got a lot on my mind."
LINE 137: Sarah's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Alex thought she was going to press
LINE 138: further. But then she stepped aside, her expression unreadable. "Just make sure
LINE 139: you keep it together, Harper. We don't need any more problems on this case."
LINE 140: As Alex finally made it to their desk, they let out a breath they hadn't
LINE 141: realized they'd been holding. The weight of the day—of the loop—pressed down on
LINE 142: them like an anchor. They had no idea how they were going to get through this.
LINE 143: But one thing was certain: they couldn't do it alone.
