LINE 1: The daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two
LINE 2: with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the
LINE 3: order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
LINE 4: Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door: I
LINE 5: feared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the
LINE 6: door. I took it up. It bore these words—
LINE 7: "You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little
LINE 8: longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the
LINE 9: angel's crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this
LINE 10: day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into
LINE 11: temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is
LINE 12: weak. I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, ST. JOHN."
LINE 13: "My spirit," I answered mentally, "is willing to do what is right; and
LINE 14: my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,
LINE 15: when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be
LINE 16: strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of
LINE 17: doubt, and find the open day of certainty."
LINE 18: It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain
LINE 19: beat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John
LINE 20: pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He
LINE 21: took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there
LINE 22: he would meet the coach.
LINE 23: "In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,"
LINE 24: thought I: "I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross. I too have some to
LINE 25: see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever."
LINE 26: It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in
LINE 27: walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had
LINE 28: given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I
LINE 29: had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable
LINE 30: strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned
LINE 31: whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_—not in the
LINE 32: external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I
LINE 33: could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The
LINE 34: wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the
LINE 35: foundations of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the
LINE 36: soul's cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,
LINE 37: whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a
LINE 38: cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit,
LINE 39: which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the
LINE 40: success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of
LINE 41: the cumbrous body.
LINE 42: "Ere many days," I said, as I terminated my musings, "I will know
LINE 43: something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters
LINE 44: have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them."
LINE 45: At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,
LINE 46: and should be absent at least four days.
LINE 47: "Alone, Jane?" they asked.
LINE 48: "Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some
LINE 49: time been uneasy."
LINE 50: They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had
LINE 51: believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had
LINE 52: often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained
LINE 53: from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well
LINE 54: enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that
LINE 55: nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
LINE 56: It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no
LINE 57: inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not
LINE 58: now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in
LINE 59: the silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of
LINE 60: free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
LINE 61: I left Moor House at three o'clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at
LINE 62: the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the
LINE 63: coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of
LINE 64: those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great
LINE 65: distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted
LINE 66: one summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and
LINE 67: objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part
LINE 68: with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more on
LINE 69: the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.
LINE 70: It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross
LINE 71: on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning
LINE 72: the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the
LINE 73: midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral
LINE 74: hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern
LINE 75: North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a
LINE 76: once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was
LINE 77: sure we were near my bourne.
LINE 78: "How far is Thornfield Hall from here?" I asked of the ostler.
LINE 79: "Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields."
LINE 80: "My journey is closed," I thought to myself. I got out of the coach,
LINE 81: gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for
LINE 82: it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the
LINE 83: brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt
LINE 84: letters, "The Rochester Arms." My heart leapt up: I was already on my
LINE 85: master's very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:—
LINE 86: "Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you
LINE 87: know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,
LINE 88: who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do
LINE 89: with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost
LINE 90: your labour—you had better go no farther," urged the monitor. "Ask
LINE 91: information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:
LINE 92: they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if
LINE 93: Mr. Rochester be at home."
LINE 94: The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on
LINE 95: it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong
LINE 96: doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the
LINE 97: ray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields through
LINE 98: which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury
LINE 99: tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I
LINE 100: well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of
LINE 101: them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to
LINE 102: catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I
LINE 103: welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill
LINE 104: between them!
LINE 105: At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke
LINE 106: the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
LINE 107: Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard
LINE 108: walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. "My
LINE 109: first view of it shall be in front," I determined, "where its bold
LINE 110: battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single
LINE 111: out my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises
LINE 112: early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in
LINE 113: front. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I
LINE 114: should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell—I am not certain.
LINE 115: And if I did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by
LINE 116: my once more tasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps
LINE 117: at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the
LINE 118: tideless sea of the south."
LINE 119: I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:
LINE 120: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone
LINE 121: pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep
LINE 122: round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with
LINE 123: precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet
LINE 124: drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered
LINE 125: station were at my command.
LINE 126: The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.
LINE 127: I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very
LINE 128: careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and
LINE 129: reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my
LINE 130: niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in
LINE 131: front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.
LINE 132: "What affectation of diffidence was this at first?" they might have
LINE 133: demanded; "what stupid regardlessness now?"
LINE 134: Hear an illustration, reader.
LINE 135: A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a
LINE 136: glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the
LINE 137: grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he
LINE 138: withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again
LINE 139: advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he
LINE 140: lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of
LINE 141: beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their
LINE 142: first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and
LINE 143: vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,
LINE 144: touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,
LINE 145: and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he
LINE 146: no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he
LINE 147: can make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone
LINE 148: dead.
LINE 149: I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened
LINE 150: ruin.
LINE 151: No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber
LINE 152: lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for
LINE 153: doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The
LINE 154: lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The
LINE 155: front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like wall,
LINE 156: very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows:
LINE 157: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.
LINE 158: And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome
LINE 159: wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never
LINE 160: received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church
LINE 161: aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had
LINE 162: fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this
LINE 163: disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had
LINE 164: followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so,
LINE 165: whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even
LINE 166: dumb sign, mute token.
LINE 167: In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated
LINE 168: interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late
LINE 169: occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void
LINE 170: arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the
LINE 171: drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and
LINE 172: weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh!
LINE 173: where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under
LINE 174: what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower
LINE 175: near the gates, and I asked, "Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing
LINE 176: the shelter of his narrow marble house?"
LINE 177: Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but
LINE 178: at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought
LINE 179: my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit
LINE 180: down: I had some questions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely
LINE 181: knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet
LINE 182: the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure
LINE 183: for a tale of misery. The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged
LINE 184: man.
LINE 185: "You know Thornfield Hall, of course?" I managed to say at last.
LINE 186: "Yes, ma'am; I lived there once."
LINE 187: "Did you?" Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
LINE 188: "I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler," he added.
LINE 189: The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been
LINE 190: trying to evade.
LINE 191: "The late!" I gasped. "Is he dead?"
LINE 192: "I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father," he explained. I
LINE 193: breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words
LINE 194: that Mr. Edward—_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he
LINE 195: was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, "the present gentleman."
LINE 196: Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever
LINE 197: the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since he was
LINE 198: not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the
LINE 199: Antipodes.
LINE 200: "Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?" I asked, knowing, of
LINE 201: course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the
LINE 202: direct question as to where he really was.
LINE 203: "No, ma'am—oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger
LINE 204: in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last
LINE 205: autumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about
LINE 206: harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable
LINE 207: property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The
LINE 208: fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from
LINE 209: Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible
LINE 210: spectacle: I witnessed it myself."
LINE 211: "At dead of night!" I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality
LINE 212: at Thornfield. "Was it known how it originated?" I demanded.
LINE 213: "They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was
LINE 214: ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware," he continued,
LINE 215: edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, "that
LINE 216: there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?"
LINE 217: "I have heard something of it."
LINE 218: "She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am; people even for some
LINE 219: years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they
LINE 220: only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what
LINE 221: she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had
LINE 222: brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.
LINE 223: But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing."
LINE 224: I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the
LINE 225: main fact.
LINE 226: "And this lady?"
LINE 227: "This lady, ma'am," he answered, "turned out to be Mr. Rochester's
LINE 228: wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a
LINE 229: young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—"
LINE 230: "But the fire," I suggested.
LINE 231: "I'm coming to that, ma'am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The
LINE 232: servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was
LINE 233: after her continually. They used to watch him—servants will, you know,
LINE 234: ma'am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him
LINE 235: thought her so very handsome. She was a little small thing, they say,
LINE 236: almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the
LINE 237: house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. Rochester was
LINE 238: about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen
LINE 239: of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were
LINE 240: bewitched. Well, he would marry her."
LINE 241: "You shall tell me this part of the story another time," I said; "but
LINE 242: now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.
LINE 243: Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in
LINE 244: it?"
LINE 245: "You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody
LINE 246: but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called
LINE 247: Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one
LINE 248: fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—_she kept a
LINE 249: private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.
LINE 250: It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was
LINE 251: dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,
LINE 252: the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of
LINE 253: her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the
LINE 254: house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she
LINE 255: had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about
LINE 256: that. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the
LINE 257: room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made
LINE 258: her way to the chamber that had been the governess's—(she was like as
LINE 259: if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at
LINE 260: her)—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in
LINE 261: it, fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for
LINE 262: all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing
LINE 263: he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew
LINE 264: savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but
LINE 265: he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent
LINE 266: Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but
LINE 267: he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and
LINE 268: she deserved it—she was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, a ward he had,
LINE 269: was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and
LINE 270: shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall."
LINE 271: "What! did he not leave England?"
LINE 272: "Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of
LINE 273: the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the
LINE 274: grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my
LINE 275: opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he
LINE 276: was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.
LINE 277: He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and
LINE 278: he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his
LINE 279: own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part,
LINE 280: I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she
LINE 281: came to Thornfield Hall."
LINE 282: "Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?"
LINE 283: "Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning
LINE 284: above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them
LINE 285: down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And
LINE 286: then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was
LINE 287: standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till
LINE 288: they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own
LINE 289: eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it
LINE 290: streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and several
LINE 291: more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the
LINE 292: roof; we heard him call 'Bertha!' We saw him approach her; and then,
LINE 293: ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay
LINE 294: smashed on the pavement."
LINE 295: The next minute she lay smashed on the pavement
LINE 296: "Dead?"
LINE 297: "Dead! Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were
LINE 298: scattered."
LINE 299: "Good God!"
LINE 300: "You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!"
LINE 301: He shuddered.
LINE 302: "And afterwards?" I urged.
LINE 303: "Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are
LINE 304: only some bits of walls standing now."
LINE 305: "Were any other lives lost?"
LINE 306: "No—perhaps it would have been better if there had."
LINE 307: "What do you mean?"
LINE 308: "Poor Mr. Edward!" he ejaculated, "I little thought ever to have seen
LINE 309: it! Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first
LINE 310: marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one
LINE 311: living: but I pity him, for my part."
LINE 312: "You said he was alive?" I exclaimed.
LINE 313: "Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead."
LINE 314: "Why? How?" My blood was again running cold. "Where is he?" I demanded.
LINE 315: "Is he in England?"
LINE 316: "Ay—ay—he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy—he's a
LINE 317: fixture now."
LINE 318: What agony was this! And the man seemed resolved to protract it.
LINE 319: "He is stone-blind," he said at last. "Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr.
LINE 320: Edward."
LINE 321: I had dreaded worse. I had dreaded he was mad. I summoned strength to
LINE 322: ask what had caused this calamity.
LINE 323: "It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a
LINE 324: way, ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out
LINE 325: before him. As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs.
LINE 326: Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great
LINE 327: crash—all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly
LINE 328: hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one
LINE 329: eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the
LINE 330: surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he lost
LINE 331: the sight of that also. He is now helpless, indeed—blind and a
LINE 332: cripple."
LINE 333: "Where is he? Where does he now live?"
LINE 334: "At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off:
LINE 335: quite a desolate spot."
LINE 336: "Who is with him?"
LINE 337: "Old John and his wife: he would have none else. He is quite broken
LINE 338: down, they say."
LINE 339: "Have you any sort of conveyance?"
LINE 340: "We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise."
LINE 341: "Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to
LINE 342: Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire
LINE 343: you usually demand."
