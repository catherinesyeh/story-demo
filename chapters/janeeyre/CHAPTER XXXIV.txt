LINE 1: It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of
LINE 2: general holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care
LINE 3: that the parting should not be barren on my side. Good fortune opens
LINE 4: the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we
LINE 5: have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual
LINE 6: ebullition of the sensations. I had long felt with pleasure that many
LINE 7: of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness
LINE 8: was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.
LINE 9: Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their
LINE 10: unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass
LINE 11: in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching
LINE 12: in their school.
LINE 13: Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty
LINE 14: girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in
LINE 15: my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some
LINE 16: half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and
LINE 17: well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British
LINE 18: peasantry. And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British
LINE 19: peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of
LINE 20: any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bäuerinnen;
LINE 21: and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted,
LINE 22: compared with my Morton girls.
LINE 23: "Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?"
LINE 24: asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone. "Does not the consciousness of
LINE 25: having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?"
LINE 26: "Doubtless."
LINE 27: "And you have only toiled a few months! Would not a life devoted to the
LINE 28: task of regenerating your race be well spent?"
LINE 29: "Yes," I said; "but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my
LINE 30: own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. I must
LINE 31: enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am
LINE 32: out of it and disposed for full holiday."
LINE 33: He looked grave. "What now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince?
LINE 34: What are you going to do?"
LINE 35: "To be active: as active as I can. And first I must beg you to set
LINE 36: Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you."
LINE 37: "Do you want her?"
LINE 38: "Yes, to go with me to Moor House. Diana and Mary will be at home in a
LINE 39: week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival."
LINE 40: "I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion. It
LINE 41: is better so: Hannah shall go with you."
LINE 42: "Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom
LINE 43: key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning."
LINE 44: He took it. "You give it up very gleefully," said he; "I don't quite
LINE 45: understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what
LINE 46: employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are
LINE 47: relinquishing. What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you
LINE 48: now?"
LINE 49: "My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force
LINE 50: of the expression?)—to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar;
LINE 51: my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of
LINE 52: cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair,
LINE 53: table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go
LINE 54: near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room;
LINE 55: and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are
LINE 56: expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs,
LINE 57: sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes,
LINE 58: chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other
LINE 59: culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the
LINE 60: uninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an
LINE 61: absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next
LINE 62: Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome
LINE 63: when they come."
LINE 64: St. John smiled slightly: still he was dissatisfied.
LINE 65: "It is all very well for the present," said he; "but seriously, I trust
LINE 66: that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little
LINE 67: higher than domestic endearments and household joys."
LINE 68: "The best things the world has!" I interrupted.
LINE 69: "No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt
LINE 70: to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful."
LINE 71: "I mean, on the contrary, to be busy."
LINE 72: "Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for
LINE 73: the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with
LINE 74: this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will
LINE 75: begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and
LINE 76: the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence. I hope
LINE 77: your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength."
LINE 78: I looked at him with surprise. "St. John," I said, "I think you are
LINE 79: almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen,
LINE 80: and you try to stir me up to restlessness! To what end?"
LINE 81: "To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to
LINE 82: your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict
LINE 83: account. Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously—I warn you of
LINE 84: that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you
LINE 85: throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures. Don't cling so
LINE 86: tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an
LINE 87: adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects. Do
LINE 88: you hear, Jane?"
LINE 89: "Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause
LINE 90: to be happy, and I _will_ be happy. Goodbye!"
LINE 91: Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she
LINE 92: was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house
LINE 93: turned topsy-turvy—how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.
LINE 94: And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was
LINE 95: delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had
LINE 96: made. I had previously taken a journey to S—— to purchase some new
LINE 97: furniture: my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what
LINE 98: alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that
LINE 99: purpose. The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they
LINE 100: were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing
LINE 101: again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the
LINE 102: spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was
LINE 103: necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it
LINE 104: to be invested. Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement
LINE 105: of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,
LINE 106: new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables,
LINE 107: answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare
LINE 108: parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and
LINE 109: crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the
LINE 110: stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model
LINE 111: of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen
LINE 112: of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.
LINE 113: The eventful Thursday at length came. They were expected about dark,
LINE 114: and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in
LINE 115: perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
LINE 116: St. John arrived first. I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the
LINE 117: house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the
LINE 118: commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls
LINE 119: sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen,
LINE 120: watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.
LINE 121: Approaching the hearth, he asked, "If I was at last satisfied with
LINE 122: housemaid's work?" I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a
LINE 123: general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I
LINE 124: got him to make the tour of the house. He just looked in at the doors I
LINE 125: opened; and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he said I
LINE 126: must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have
LINE 127: effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a
LINE 128: syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his
LINE 129: abode.
LINE 130: This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed
LINE 131: some old associations he valued. I inquired whether this was the case:
LINE 132: no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.
LINE 133: "Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously
LINE 134: respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed
LINE 135: more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for
LINE 136: instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very
LINE 137: room?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?"
LINE 138: I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing
LINE 139: to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
LINE 140: Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began
LINE 141: to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and
LINE 142: cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for
LINE 143: him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to
LINE 144: aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would
LINE 145: never rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his
LINE 146: lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments
LINE 147: fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a
LINE 148: good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I
LINE 149: understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;
LINE 150: I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended
LINE 151: how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised
LINE 152: over him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should
LINE 153: mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I
LINE 154: saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian
LINE 155: and Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast
LINE 156: bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too
LINE 157: often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.
LINE 158: "This parlour is not his sphere," I reflected: "the Himalayan ridge or
LINE 159: Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him
LINE 160: better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his
LINE 161: element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to
LINE 162: advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is
LINE 163: proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak
LINE 164: and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the
LINE 165: advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary's
LINE 166: career—I see it now."
LINE 167: "They are coming! they are coming!" cried Hannah, throwing open the
LINE 168: parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran.
LINE 169: It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had
LINE 170: a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened
LINE 171: the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a
LINE 172: minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's
LINE 173: soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls. They laughed—kissed
LINE 174: me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked
LINE 175: eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened
LINE 176: into the house.
LINE 177: They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and
LINE 178: chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances
LINE 179: expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought
LINE 180: in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from
LINE 181: the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once. He gave
LINE 182: each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a
LINE 183: while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would
LINE 184: soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
LINE 185: I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give
LINE 186: hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
LINE 187: They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;
LINE 188: with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:
LINE 189: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of
LINE 190: feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I
LINE 191: had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
LINE 192: Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so
LINE 193: eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St.
LINE 194: John's taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in
LINE 195: their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The
LINE 196: event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but
LINE 197: the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee
LINE 198: of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In
LINE 199: the very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a
LINE 200: rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that "a
LINE 201: poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see
LINE 202: his mother, who was drawing away."
LINE 203: "Where does she live, Hannah?"
LINE 204: "Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss
LINE 205: all the way."
LINE 206: "Tell him I will go."
LINE 207: "I'm sure, sir, you had better not. It's the worst road to travel after
LINE 208: dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog. And then it is
LINE 209: such a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send
LINE 210: word, sir, that you will be there in the morning."
LINE 211: But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without
LINE 212: one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o'clock: he
LINE 213: did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he
LINE 214: looked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty;
LINE 215: made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on
LINE 216: better terms with himself.
LINE 217: I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was
LINE 218: Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a
LINE 219: sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom
LINE 220: of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like
LINE 221: some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from
LINE 222: noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty,
LINE 223: pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to,
LINE 224: and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our
LINE 225: vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his
LINE 226: parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business
LINE 227: in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
LINE 228: One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for
LINE 229: some minutes, asked him, "If his plans were yet unchanged."
LINE 230: "Unchanged and unchangeable," was the reply. And he proceeded to inform
LINE 231: us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the
LINE 232: ensuing year.
LINE 233: "And Rosamond Oliver?" suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her
LINE 234: lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a
LINE 235: gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his
LINE 236: hand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and
LINE 237: looked up.
LINE 238: "Rosamond Oliver," said he, "is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one
LINE 239: of the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grandson and
LINE 240: heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father
LINE 241: yesterday."
LINE 242: His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:
LINE 243: he was serene as glass.
LINE 244: "The match must have been got up hastily," said Diana: "they cannot
LINE 245: have known each other long."
LINE 246: "But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. But
LINE 247: where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where
LINE 248: the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary:
LINE 249: they will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up
LINE 250: to them, can be refitted for their reception."
LINE 251: The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt
LINE 252: tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little
LINE 253: to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I
LINE 254: experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already
LINE 255: hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve
LINE 256: was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He
LINE 257: had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he
LINE 258: continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not
LINE 259: at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was
LINE 260: acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I
LINE 261: felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known
LINE 262: me only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had
LINE 263: once been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his
LINE 264: present frigidity.
LINE 265: Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his
LINE 266: head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said—
LINE 267: "You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won."
LINE 268: Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a
LINE 269: moment's hesitation I answered—
LINE 270: "But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose
LINE 271: triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?"
LINE 272: "I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be
LINE 273: called upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is
LINE 274: decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!" So saying, he
LINE 275: returned to his papers and his silence.
LINE 276: As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled
LINE 277: into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular
LINE 278: studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room,
LINE 279: sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course
LINE 280: of encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken,
LINE 281: and I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that
LINE 282: of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary
LINE 283: to his plans.
LINE 284: Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and
LINE 285: absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the
LINE 286: outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing
LINE 287: upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:
LINE 288: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it
LINE 289: returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I
LINE 290: wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit
LINE 291: on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly
LINE 292: visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day
LINE 293: was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his
LINE 294: sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their
LINE 295: solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to
LINE 296: the elements.
LINE 297: "Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her," he would say: "she
LINE 298: can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as
LINE 299: well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;—better
LINE 300: calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust."
LINE 301: And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little
LINE 302: weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur
LINE 303: would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the
LINE 304: reverse was a special annoyance.
LINE 305: One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really
LINE 306: had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading
LINE 307: Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged
LINE 308: a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I
LINE 309: found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How
LINE 310: long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I
LINE 311: cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment
LINE 312: superstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
LINE 313: "Jane, what are you doing?"
LINE 314: "Learning German."
LINE 315: "I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee."
LINE 316: "You are not in earnest?"
LINE 317: "In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why."
LINE 318: He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was
LINE 319: himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget
LINE 320: the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with
LINE 321: whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them
LINE 322: thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time
LINE 323: between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw
LINE 324: I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him this
LINE 325: favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it
LINE 326: wanted now barely three months to his departure.
LINE 327: St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every
LINE 328: impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved
LINE 329: and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former
LINE 330: found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and
LINE 331: both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them
LINE 332: to such a step. He answered quietly—
LINE 333: "I know it."
LINE 334: I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting
LINE 335: master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his
LINE 336: expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By
LINE 337: degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my
LINE 338: liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his
LINE 339: indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,
LINE 340: because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at
LINE 341: least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only
LINE 342: serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence
LINE 343: every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a
LINE 344: freezing spell. When he said "go," I went; "come," I came; "do this," I
LINE 345: did it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had
LINE 346: continued to neglect me.
LINE 347: One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him,
LINE 348: bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and,
LINE 349: as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to
LINE 350: be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his
LINE 351: will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—
LINE 352: "St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat
LINE 353: her as such: you should kiss her too."
LINE 354: She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt
LINE 355: uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.
LINE 356: John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine,
LINE 357: his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no such
LINE 358: things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my
LINE 359: ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but
LINE 360: there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When
LINE 361: given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure
LINE 362: I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt
LINE 363: as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the
LINE 364: ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I
LINE 365: underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.
LINE 366: As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt
LINE 367: daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my
LINE 368: faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to
LINE 369: the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted
LINE 370: to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to
LINE 371: aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to
LINE 372: mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give
LINE 373: to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his
LINE 374: own.
LINE 375: Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of
LINE 376: late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat
LINE 377: at my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of
LINE 378: suspense.
LINE 379: Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these
LINE 380: changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with
LINE 381: me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a
LINE 382: sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a
LINE 383: tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving
LINE 384: to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at
LINE 385: Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now
LINE 386: at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
LINE 387: In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the
LINE 388: will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present
LINE 389: residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was
LINE 390: quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,
LINE 391: entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty
LINE 392: on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early
LINE 393: answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but
LINE 394: when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and
LINE 395: brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
LINE 396: I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
LINE 397: Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some
LINE 398: weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word
LINE 399: reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died
LINE 400: out, and then I felt dark indeed.
LINE 401: A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer
LINE 402: approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished
LINE 403: to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did
LINE 404: not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too
LINE 405: purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying
LINE 406: deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and
LINE 407: grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,
LINE 408: never thought of resisting him—I could not resist him.
LINE 409: One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb
LINE 410: was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me
LINE 411: in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take
LINE 412: it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me
LINE 413: at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.
LINE 414: The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring
LINE 415: over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe,
LINE 416: my eyes filled again.
LINE 417: St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my
LINE 418: voice failed me: words were lost in sobs. He and I were the only
LINE 419: occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the
LINE 420: drawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear,
LINE 421: sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,
LINE 422: nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—
LINE 423: "We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed." And
LINE 424: while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,
LINE 425: leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye
LINE 426: of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's
LINE 427: malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something
LINE 428: about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and
LINE 429: succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and his, locked
LINE 430: his desk, and said—
LINE 431: "Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me."
LINE 432: "I will call Diana and Mary."
LINE 433: "No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. Put
LINE 434: on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the
LINE 435: head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
LINE 436: I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my
LINE 437: dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own,
LINE 438: between absolute submission and determined revolt. I have always
LINE 439: faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting,
LINE 440: sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither
LINE 441: present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to
LINE 442: mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and in
LINE 443: ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side
LINE 444: with him.
LINE 445: The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents
LINE 446: of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending
LINE 447: the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and
LINE 448: clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the
LINE 449: firmament. As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf,
LINE 450: mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white
LINE 451: flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills,
LINE 452: meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to
LINE 453: their very core.
LINE 454: "Let us rest here," said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers
LINE 455: of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck
LINE 456: rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the
LINE 457: mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag
LINE 458: for gem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the
LINE 459: fresh for the frowning—where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude,
LINE 460: and a last refuge for silence.
LINE 461: I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He looked up the pass and down
LINE 462: the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to
LINE 463: traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat,
LINE 464: let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion
LINE 465: with the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to
LINE 466: something.
LINE 467: "And I shall see it again," he said aloud, "in dreams when I sleep by
LINE 468: the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour—when another slumber
LINE 469: overcomes me—on the shore of a darker stream!"
LINE 470: Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot's passion for his
LINE 471: fatherland! He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to
LINE 472: me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced—
LINE 473: "Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman
LINE 474: which sails on the 20th of June."
LINE 475: "God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work," I answered.
LINE 476: "Yes," said he, "there is my glory and joy. I am the servant of an
LINE 477: infallible Master. I am not going out under human guidance, subject to
LINE 478: the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my
LINE 479: king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect. It seems strange to
LINE 480: me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,—to
LINE 481: join in the same enterprise."
LINE 482: "All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish
LINE 483: to march with the strong."
LINE 484: "I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as
LINE 485: are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it."
LINE 486: "Those are few in number, and difficult to discover."
LINE 487: "You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up—to urge and
LINE 488: exhort them to the effort—to show them what their gifts are, and why
LINE 489: they were given—to speak Heaven's message in their ear,—to offer them,
LINE 490: direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen."
LINE 491: "If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts
LINE 492: be the first to inform them of it?"
LINE 493: I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I
LINE 494: trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and
LINE 495: rivet the spell.
LINE 496: "And what does _your_ heart say?" demanded St. John.
LINE 497: "My heart is mute,—my heart is mute," I answered, struck and thrilled.
LINE 498: "Then I must speak for it," continued the deep, relentless voice.
LINE 499: "Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer."
LINE 500: The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved! It was as if I had heard
LINE 501: a summons from Heaven—as if a visionary messenger, like him of
LINE 502: Macedonia, had enounced, "Come over and help us!" But I was no
LINE 503: apostle,—I could not behold the herald,—I could not receive his call.
LINE 504: "Oh, St. John!" I cried, "have some mercy!"
LINE 505: I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,
LINE 506: knew neither mercy nor remorse. He continued—
LINE 507: "God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. It is not
LINE 508: personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for
LINE 509: labour, not for love. A missionary's wife you must—shall be. You shall
LINE 510: be mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's
LINE 511: service."
LINE 512: "I am not fit for it: I have no vocation," I said.
LINE 513: He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by
LINE 514: them. Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his
LINE 515: arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for
LINE 516: a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to
LINE 517: last him to its close—resolved, however, that that close should be
LINE 518: conquest for him.
LINE 519: "Humility, Jane," said he, "is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you
LINE 520: say right that you are not fit for the work. Who is fit for it? Or who,
LINE 521: that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I,
LINE 522: for instance, am but dust and ashes. With St. Paul, I acknowledge
LINE 523: myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my
LINE 524: personal vileness to daunt me. I know my Leader: that He is just as
LINE 525: well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform
LINE 526: a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence,
LINE 527: supply the inadequacy of the means to the end. Think like me,
LINE 528: Jane—trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not
LINE 529: doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness."
LINE 530: "I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary
LINE 531: labours."
LINE 532: "There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you
LINE 533: your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment
LINE 534: to moment. This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your
LINE 535: powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require
LINE 536: my help."
LINE 537: "But my powers—where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them.
LINE 538: Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk. I am sensible of no light
LINE 539: kindling—no life quickening—no voice counselling or cheering. Oh, I
LINE 540: wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a
LINE 541: rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths—the
LINE 542: fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!"
LINE 543: "I have an answer for you—hear it. I have watched you ever since we
LINE 544: first met: I have made you my study for ten months. I have proved you
LINE 545: in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? In the
LINE 546: village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly,
LINE 547: labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could
LINE 548: perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.
LINE 549: In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read
LINE 550: a mind clear of the vice of Demas:—lucre had no undue power over you.
LINE 551: In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four
LINE 552: shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others
LINE 553: to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in
LINE 554: the flame and excitement of sacrifice. In the tractability with which,
LINE 555: at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and
LINE 556: adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity
LINE 557: with which you have since persevered in it—in the unflagging energy and
LINE 558: unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties—I acknowledge
LINE 559: the complement of the qualities I seek. Jane, you are docile, diligent,
LINE 560: disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and
LINE 561: very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself—I can trust you unreservedly.
LINE 562: As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women,
LINE 563: your assistance will be to me invaluable."
LINE 564: My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure
LINE 565: step. Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in
LINE 566: making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear. My
LINE 567: work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed
LINE 568: itself as he proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his shaping
LINE 569: hand. He waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to
LINE 570: think, before I again hazarded a reply.
LINE 571: "Very willingly," he rejoined; and rising, he strode a little distance
LINE 572: up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay
LINE 573: still.
LINE 574: He threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still
LINE 575: "I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge
LINE 576: that," I meditated,—"that is, if life be spared me. But I feel mine is
LINE 577: not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun. What then?
LINE 578: He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign
LINE 579: me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me. The case is
LINE 580: very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but
LINE 581: empty land—Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what
LINE 582: can that ever be to me? My business is to live without him now: nothing
LINE 583: so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting
LINE 584: some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.
LINE 585: Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life
LINE 586: to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly
LINE 587: the most glorious man can adopt or God assign? Is it not, by its noble
LINE 588: cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void
LINE 589: left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes? I believe I must say,
LINE 590: Yes—and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself:
LINE 591: if I go to India, I go to premature death. And how will the interval
LINE 592: between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?
LINE 593: Oh, I know well! That, too, is very clear to my vision. By straining to
LINE 594: satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him—to the
LINE 595: finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.
LINE 596: If I _do_ go with him—if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will
LINE 597: make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar—heart, vitals, the
LINE 598: entire victim. He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will
LINE 599: show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never
LINE 600: suspected. Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little
LINE 601: grudging.
LINE 602: "Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item—one
LINE 603: dreadful item. It is—that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of
LINE 604: a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which
LINE 605: the stream is foaming in yonder gorge. He prizes me as a soldier would
LINE 606: a good weapon; and that is all. Unmarried to him, this would never
LINE 607: grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations—coolly put into
LINE 608: practice his plans—go through the wedding ceremony? Can I receive from
LINE 609: him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he
LINE 610: would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?
LINE 611: Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a
LINE 612: sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous. I
LINE 613: will never undergo it. As his sister, I might accompany him—not as his
LINE 614: wife: I will tell him so."
LINE 615: I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;
LINE 616: his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen. He started to
LINE 617: his feet and approached me.
LINE 618: "I am ready to go to India, if I may go free."
LINE 619: "Your answer requires a commentary," he said; "it is not clear."
LINE 620: "You have hitherto been my adopted brother—I, your adopted sister: let
LINE 621: us continue as such: you and I had better not marry."
LINE 622: He shook his head. "Adopted fraternity will not do in this case. If you
LINE 623: were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek
LINE 624: no wife. But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed
LINE 625: by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves
LINE 626: to any other plan. Do you not see it, Jane? Consider a moment—your
LINE 627: strong sense will guide you."
LINE 628: I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to
LINE 629: the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and
LINE 630: therefore it inferred we ought not to marry. I said so. "St. John," I
LINE 631: returned, "I regard you as a brother—you, me as a sister: so let us
LINE 632: continue."
LINE 633: "We cannot—we cannot," he answered, with short, sharp determination:
LINE 634: "it would not do. You have said you will go with me to India:
LINE 635: remember—you have said that."
LINE 636: "Conditionally."
LINE 637: "Well—well. To the main point—the departure with me from England, the
LINE 638: co-operation with me in my future labours—you do not object. You have
LINE 639: already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent
LINE 640: to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view—how the work you
LINE 641: have undertaken can best be done. Simplify your complicated interests,
LINE 642: feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one
LINE 643: purpose: that of fulfilling with effect—with power—the mission of your
LINE 644: great Master. To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother—that
LINE 645: is a loose tie—but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister: a sister
LINE 646: might any day be taken from me. I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can
LINE 647: influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death."
LINE 648: I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow—his hold on
LINE 649: my limbs.
LINE 650: "Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you."
LINE 651: "One fitted to my purpose, you mean—fitted to my vocation. Again I tell
LINE 652: you it is not the insignificant private individual—the mere man, with
LINE 653: the man's selfish senses—I wish to mate: it is the missionary."
LINE 654: "And I will give the missionary my energies—it is all he wants—but not
LINE 655: myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel. For
LINE 656: them he has no use: I retain them."
LINE 657: "You cannot—you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half
LINE 658: an oblation? Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of
LINE 659: God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you. I cannot accept
LINE 660: on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire."
LINE 661: "Oh! I will give my heart to God," I said. "_You_ do not want it."
LINE 662: I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed
LINE 663: sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the
LINE 664: feeling that accompanied it. I had silently feared St. John till now,
LINE 665: because I had not understood him. He had held me in awe, because he had
LINE 666: held me in doubt. How much of him was saint, how much mortal, I could
LINE 667: not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this
LINE 668: conference: the analysis of his nature was proceeding before my eyes. I
LINE 669: saw his fallibilities: I comprehended them. I understood that, sitting
LINE 670: there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form
LINE 671: before me, I sat at the feet of a man, erring as I. The veil fell from
LINE 672: his hardness and despotism. Having felt in him the presence of these
LINE 673: qualities, I felt his imperfection and took courage. I was with an
LINE 674: equal—one with whom I might argue—one whom, if I saw good, I might
LINE 675: resist.
LINE 676: He was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently
LINE 677: risked an upward glance at his countenance. His eye, bent on me,
LINE 678: expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry. "Is she sarcastic,
LINE 679: and sarcastic to _me!_" it seemed to say. "What does this signify?"
LINE 680: "Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter," he said ere long;
LINE 681: "one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin. I
LINE 682: trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart
LINE 683: to God: it is all I want. Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it
LINE 684: on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on
LINE 685: earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do
LINE 686: at once whatever furthers that end. You will see what impetus would be
LINE 687: given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in
LINE 688: marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity
LINE 689: to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all
LINE 690: minor caprices—all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling—all
LINE 691: scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal
LINE 692: inclination—you will hasten to enter into that union at once."
LINE 693: "Shall I?" I said briefly; and I looked at his features, beautiful in
LINE 694: their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his
LINE 695: brow, commanding but not open; at his eyes, bright and deep and
LINE 696: searching, but never soft; at his tall imposing figure; and fancied
LINE 697: myself in idea _his wife_. Oh! it would never do! As his curate, his
LINE 698: comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that
LINE 699: capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that
LINE 700: office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;
LINE 701: accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his
LINE 702: ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:
LINE 703: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other. I should
LINE 704: suffer often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity: my body
LINE 705: would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be
LINE 706: free. I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural
LINE 707: unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.
LINE 708: There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which
LINE 709: he never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which
LINE 710: his austerity could never blight, nor his measured warrior-march
LINE 711: trample down: but as his wife—at his side always, and always
LINE 712: restrained, and always checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature
LINE 713: continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry,
LINE 714: though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital—_this_ would be
LINE 715: unendurable.
LINE 716: "St. John!" I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
LINE 717: "Well?" he answered icily.
LINE 718: "I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary,
LINE 719: but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you."
LINE 720: "A part of me you must become," he answered steadily; "otherwise the
LINE 721: whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with
LINE 722: me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me? How can we
LINE 723: be for ever together—sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage
LINE 724: tribes—and unwed?"
LINE 725: "Very well," I said shortly; "under the circumstances, quite as well as
LINE 726: if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like
LINE 727: yourself."
LINE 728: "It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as
LINE 729: such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.
LINE 730: And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a
LINE 731: woman's heart and—it would not do."
LINE 732: "It would do," I affirmed with some disdain, "perfectly well. I have a
LINE 733: woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a
LINE 734: comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity,
LINE 735: fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his
LINE 736: hierophant: nothing more—don't fear."
LINE 737: "It is what I want," he said, speaking to himself; "it is just what I
LINE 738: want. And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane,
LINE 739: you would not repent marrying me—be certain of that; we _must_ be
LINE 740: married. I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of
LINE 741: love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your
LINE 742: eyes."
LINE 743: "I scorn your idea of love," I could not help saying, as I rose up and
LINE 744: stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. "I scorn the
LINE 745: counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when
LINE 746: you offer it."
LINE 747: He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
LINE 748: Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:
LINE 749: he could command his countenance thoroughly.
LINE 750: "I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you," he said: "I
LINE 751: think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn."
LINE 752: I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.
LINE 753: "Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have
LINE 754: been roused to speak so unguardedly. You have introduced a topic on
LINE 755: which our natures are at variance—a topic we should never discuss: the
LINE 756: very name of love is an apple of discord between us. If the reality
LINE 757: were required, what should we do? How should we feel? My dear cousin,
LINE 758: abandon your scheme of marriage—forget it."
LINE 759: "No," said he; "it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which
LINE 760: can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.
LINE 761: To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to
LINE 762: whom I should wish to say farewell. I shall be absent a fortnight—take
LINE 763: that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you
LINE 764: reject it, it is not me you deny, but God. Through my means, He opens
LINE 765: to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to
LINE 766: be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease
LINE 767: and barren obscurity. Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered
LINE 768: with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!"
LINE 769: He had done. Turning from me, he once more
LINE 770: "Looked to river, looked to hill."
LINE 771: But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy
LINE 772: to hear them uttered. As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in
LINE 773: his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an
LINE 774: austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected
LINE 775: submission—the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has
LINE 776: detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to
LINE 777: sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into
LINE 778: obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with
LINE 779: my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and
LINE 780: repentance.
LINE 781: That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to
LINE 782: forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.
LINE 783: I—who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him—was hurt by
LINE 784: the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
LINE 785: "I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane," said Diana,
LINE 786: "during your walk on the moor. But go after him; he is now lingering in
LINE 787: the passage expecting you—he will make it up."
LINE 788: I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather
LINE 789: be happy than dignified; and I ran after him—he stood at the foot of
LINE 790: the stairs.
LINE 791: "Good-night, St. John," said I.
LINE 792: "Good-night, Jane," he replied calmly.
LINE 793: "Then shake hands," I added.
LINE 794: What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers! He was deeply
LINE 795: displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm,
LINE 796: nor tears move him. No happy reconciliation was to be had with him—no
LINE 797: cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient
LINE 798: and placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he
LINE 799: was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he
LINE 800: had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
LINE 801: And with that answer he left me. I would much rather he had knocked me
LINE 802: down.
