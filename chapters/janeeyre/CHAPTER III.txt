LINE 1: The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had
LINE 2: a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare,
LINE 3: crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a
LINE 4: hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,
LINE 5: uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my
LINE 6: faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;
LINE 7: lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more
LINE 8: tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head
LINE 9: against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
LINE 10: In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite
LINE 11: well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery
LINE 12: fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the
LINE 13: bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near
LINE 14: my pillow, leaning over me.
LINE 15: I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and
LINE 16: security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an
LINE 17: individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
LINE 18: Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me
LINE 19: than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the
LINE 20: face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,
LINE 21: sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for
LINE 22: herself and the children she employed a physician.
LINE 23: "Well, who am I?" he asked.
LINE 24: I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took
LINE 25: it, smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by." Then he laid
LINE 26: me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I
LINE 27: was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further
LINE 28: directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he
LINE 29: departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat
LINE 30: in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all
LINE 31: the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness
LINE 32: weighed it down.
LINE 33: "Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?" asked Bessie, rather
LINE 34: softly.
LINE 35: Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be
LINE 36: rough. "I will try."
LINE 37: "Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
LINE 38: "No, thank you, Bessie."
LINE 39: "Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you
LINE 40: may call me if you want anything in the night."
LINE 41: Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question.
LINE 42: "Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?"
LINE 43: "You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be
LINE 44: better soon, no doubt."
LINE 45: Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near. I heard her
LINE 46: say—
LINE 47: "Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be
LINE 48: alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange
LINE 49: thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis
LINE 50: was rather too hard."
LINE 51: Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
LINE 52: together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of
LINE 53: their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer
LINE 54: the main subject discussed.
LINE 55: "Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished"—"A great
LINE 56: black dog behind him"—"Three loud raps on the chamber door"—"A light in
LINE 57: the churchyard just over his grave," &c., &c.
LINE 58: At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the
LINE 59: watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and
LINE 60: mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can
LINE 61: feel.
LINE 62: No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the
LINE 63: red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the
LINE 64: reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful
LINE 65: pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not
LINE 66: what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only
LINE 67: uprooting my bad propensities.
LINE 68: Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by
LINE 69: the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my
LINE 70: worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness
LINE 71: which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt
LINE 72: drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to
LINE 73: have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone
LINE 74: out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another
LINE 75: room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys
LINE 76: and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of
LINE 77: unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a
LINE 78: paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand
LINE 79: and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such
LINE 80: a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them
LINE 81: agreeably.
LINE 82: Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a
LINE 83: tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,
LINE 84: nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir
LINE 85: in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had
LINE 86: often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine
LINE 87: it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a
LINE 88: privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was
LINE 89: cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain
LINE 90: favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished
LINE 91: for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,
LINE 92: the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and
LINE 93: tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted
LINE 94: as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels
LINE 95: from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight.
LINE 96: I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of
LINE 97: interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,
LINE 98: having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under
LINE 99: mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at
LINE 100: length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of
LINE 101: England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,
LINE 102: and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being,
LINE 103: in my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I
LINE 104: might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little
LINE 105: fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep,
LINE 106: and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty
LINE 107: mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.
LINE 108: Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned
LINE 109: over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had,
LINE 110: till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants
LINE 111: were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a
LINE 112: most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed
LINE 113: the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table,
LINE 114: beside the untasted tart.
LINE 115: Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed
LINE 116: her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds
LINE 117: of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
LINE 118: Meantime she sang: her song was—
LINE 119: "In the days when we went gipsying,
LINE 120: A long time ago."
LINE 121: I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for
LINE 122: Bessie had a sweet voice,—at least, I thought so. But now, though her
LINE 123: voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
LINE 124: Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low,
LINE 125: very lingeringly; "A long time ago" came out like the saddest cadence
LINE 126: of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really
LINE 127: doleful one.
LINE 128: "My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
LINE 129: Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
LINE 130: Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
LINE 131: Over the path of the poor orphan child.
LINE 132: Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
LINE 133: Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
LINE 134: Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only
LINE 135: Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
LINE 136: Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,
LINE 137: Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,
LINE 138: God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
LINE 139: Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
LINE 140: Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
LINE 141: Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,
LINE 142: Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
LINE 143: Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
LINE 144: There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
LINE 145: Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;
LINE 146: Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me;
LINE 147: God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
LINE 148: "Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished. She might as
LINE 149: well have said to the fire, "don't burn!" but how could she divine the
LINE 150: morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning
LINE 151: Mr. Lloyd came again.
LINE 152: "What, already up!" said he, as he entered the nursery. "Well, nurse,
LINE 153: how is she?"
LINE 154: Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
LINE 155: "Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name
LINE 156: is Jane, is it not?"
LINE 157: "Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
LINE 158: "Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what
LINE 159: about? Have you any pain?"
LINE 160: "No, sir."
LINE 161: "Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis
LINE 162: in the carriage," interposed Bessie.
LINE 163: "Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness."
LINE 164: I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge,
LINE 165: I answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate
LINE 166: going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable."
LINE 167: "Oh fie, Miss!" said Bessie.
LINE 168: The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before
LINE 169: him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and
LINE 170: grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now:
LINE 171: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered
LINE 172: me at leisure, he said—
LINE 173: "What made you ill yesterday?"
LINE 174: "She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
LINE 175: "Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can't she manage to walk at her
LINE 176: age? She must be eight or nine years old."
LINE 177: "I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by
LINE 178: another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill," I
LINE 179: added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
LINE 180: As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang
LINE 181: for the servants' dinner; he knew what it was. "That's for you, nurse,"
LINE 182: said he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come
LINE 183: back."
LINE 184: Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
LINE 185: punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
LINE 186: "The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when
LINE 187: Bessie was gone.
LINE 188: "I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
LINE 189: I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
LINE 190: "Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?"
LINE 191: "Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out
LINE 192: there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if
LINE 193: they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a
LINE 194: candle,—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it."
LINE 195: "Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in
LINE 196: daylight?"
LINE 197: "No: but night will come again before long: and besides,—I am
LINE 198: unhappy,—very unhappy, for other things."
LINE 199: "What other things? Can you tell me some of them?"
LINE 200: How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was
LINE 201: to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their
LINE 202: feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they
LINE 203: know not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful,
LINE 204: however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my
LINE 205: grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a
LINE 206: meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.
LINE 207: "For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters."
LINE 208: "You have a kind aunt and cousins."
LINE 209: Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced—
LINE 210: "But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the
LINE 211: red-room."
LINE 212: Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
LINE 213: "Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?" asked he. "Are
LINE 214: you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?"
LINE 215: "It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here
LINE 216: than a servant."
LINE 217: "Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid
LINE 218: place?"
LINE 219: "If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can
LINE 220: never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman."
LINE 221: "Perhaps you may—who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?"
LINE 222: "I think not, sir."
LINE 223: "None belonging to your father?"
LINE 224: "I don't know: I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might
LINE 225: have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about
LINE 226: them."
LINE 227: "If you had such, would you like to go to them?"
LINE 228: I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to
LINE 229: children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable
LINE 230: poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,
LINE 231: scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty
LINE 232: for me was synonymous with degradation.
LINE 233: "No; I should not like to belong to poor people," was my reply.
LINE 234: "Not even if they were kind to you?"
LINE 235: I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being
LINE 236: kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to
LINE 237: be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes
LINE 238: nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of
LINE 239: the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase
LINE 240: liberty at the price of caste.
LINE 241: "But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?"
LINE 242: "I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly
LINE 243: set: I should not like to go a begging."
LINE 244: "Would you like to go to school?"
LINE 245: Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes
LINE 246: spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore
LINE 247: backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise:
LINE 248: John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed's
LINE 249: tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of
LINE 250: school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she
LINE 251: had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her
LINE 252: details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies
LINE 253: were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings
LINE 254: of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing
LINE 255: and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books
LINE 256: they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I
LINE 257: listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long
LINE 258: journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new
LINE 259: life.
LINE 260: "I should indeed like to go to school," was the audible conclusion of
LINE 261: my musings.
LINE 262: "Well, well! who knows what may happen?" said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up.
LINE 263: "The child ought to have change of air and scene," he added, speaking
LINE 264: to himself; "nerves not in a good state."
LINE 265: Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling
LINE 266: up the gravel-walk.
LINE 267: "Is that your mistress, nurse?" asked Mr. Lloyd. "I should like to
LINE 268: speak to her before I go."
LINE 269: Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way
LINE 270: out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I
LINE 271: presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to
LINE 272: recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt
LINE 273: readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject
LINE 274: with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was
LINE 275: in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, "Missis was, she dared say, glad
LINE 276: enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always
LINE 277: looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots
LINE 278: underhand." Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of
LINE 279: infantine Guy Fawkes.
LINE 280: On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's
LINE 281: communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman;
LINE 282: that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who
LINE 283: considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so
LINE 284: irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that
LINE 285: after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught
LINE 286: the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing
LINE 287: town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then
LINE 288: prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died
LINE 289: within a month of each other.
LINE 290: Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, "Poor Miss Jane
LINE 291: is to be pitied, too, Abbot."
LINE 292: "Yes," responded Abbot; "if she were a nice, pretty child, one might
LINE 293: compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a
LINE 294: little toad as that."
LINE 295: "Not a great deal, to be sure," agreed Bessie: "at any rate, a beauty
LINE 296: like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition."
LINE 297: "Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!" cried the fervent Abbot. "Little
LINE 298: darling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour
LINE 299: as she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh
LINE 300: rabbit for supper."
LINE 301: "So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down." They went.
