LINE 1: The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to
LINE 2: Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer
LINE 3: acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to
LINE 4: be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of
LINE 5: competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively
LINE 6: child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes
LINE 7: wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no
LINE 8: injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for
LINE 9: her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient
LINE 10: and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character,
LINE 11: no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch
LINE 12: above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any
LINE 13: deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable
LINE 14: progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very
LINE 15: profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to
LINE 16: please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient
LINE 17: to make us both content in each other's society.
LINE 18: This, _par parenthèse_, will be thought cool language by persons who
LINE 19: entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and
LINE 20: the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an
LINE 21: idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism,
LINE 22: to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt
LINE 23: a conscientious solicitude for Adèle's welfare and progress, and a
LINE 24: quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs.
LINE 25: Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society
LINE 26: proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation
LINE 27: of her mind and character.
LINE 28: Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,
LINE 29: when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the
LINE 30: gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle
LINE 31: played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,
LINE 32: I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and
LINE 33: having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and
LINE 34: hill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision
LINE 35: which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,
LINE 36: towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I
LINE 37: desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of
LINE 38: intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,
LINE 39: than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,
LINE 40: and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other
LINE 41: and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to
LINE 42: behold.
LINE 43: Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I
LINE 44: could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to
LINE 45: pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of
LINE 46: the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and
LINE 47: solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever
LINE 48: bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and
LINE 49: glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which,
LINE 50: while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of
LINE 51: all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my
LINE 52: imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of
LINE 53: incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual
LINE 54: existence.
LINE 55: It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with
LINE 56: tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they
LINE 57: cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and
LINE 58: millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many
LINE 59: rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life
LINE 60: which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but
LINE 61: women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties,
LINE 62: and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they
LINE 63: suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely
LINE 64: as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged
LINE 65: fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making
LINE 66: puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and
LINE 67: embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them,
LINE 68: if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced
LINE 69: necessary for their sex.
LINE 70: When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same
LINE 71: peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled
LINE 72: me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There
LINE 73: were days when she was quite silent; but there were others when I could
LINE 74: not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I saw her: she would
LINE 75: come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand,
LINE 76: go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally (oh, romantic
LINE 77: reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of
LINE 78: porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised
LINE 79: by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to
LINE 80: which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into
LINE 81: conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic
LINE 82: reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.
LINE 83: The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the
LINE 84: housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no
LINE 85: respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I
LINE 86: asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a
LINE 87: descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and
LINE 88: confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage
LINE 89: inquiry.
LINE 90: October, November, December passed away. One afternoon in January, Mrs.
LINE 91: Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adèle, because she had a cold; and, as
LINE 92: Adèle seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious
LINE 93: occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,
LINE 94: deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a
LINE 95: fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the
LINE 96: library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fairfax had just written a
LINE 97: letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak
LINE 98: and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a
LINE 99: pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adèle comfortably seated in
LINE 100: her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her her
LINE 101: best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a
LINE 102: drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and
LINE 103: having replied to her "Revenez bientôt, ma bonne amie, ma chère Mdlle.
LINE 104: Jeannette," with a kiss, I set out.
LINE 105: The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked
LINE 106: fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the
LINE 107: species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was
LINE 108: three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the
LINE 109: charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding
LINE 110: and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for
LINE 111: wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now
LINE 112: possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best
LINE 113: winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a
LINE 114: breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a
LINE 115: holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel
LINE 116: bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the
LINE 117: middle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields,
LINE 118: where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred
LINE 119: occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had
LINE 120: forgotten to drop.
LINE 121: This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the
LINE 122: middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering
LINE 123: my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel
LINE 124: the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice
LINE 125: covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had
LINE 126: overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could
LINE 127: look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the
LINE 128: principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose
LINE 129: against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees,
LINE 130: and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.
LINE 131: On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but
LINE 132: brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in
LINE 133: trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile
LINE 134: distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs
LINE 135: of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and
LINE 136: depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and
LINE 137: doubtless many becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed
LINE 138: alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.
LINE 139: A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so
LINE 140: far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,
LINE 141: which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid
LINE 142: mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and
LINE 143: strong on the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill,
LINE 144: sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
LINE 145: The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the
LINE 146: lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet,
LINE 147: as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I
LINE 148: was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind:
LINE 149: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and
LINE 150: when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness
LINE 151: beyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and as I
LINE 152: watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of
LINE 153: Bessie's tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a
LINE 154: "Gytrash," which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted
LINE 155: solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this
LINE 156: horse was now coming upon me.
LINE 157: It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,
LINE 158: tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel
LINE 159: stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a
LINE 160: distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie's
LINE 161: Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed
LINE 162: me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange
LINE 163: pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse
LINE 164: followed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human
LINE 165: being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was
LINE 166: always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the
LINE 167: dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace
LINE 168: human form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut
LINE 169: to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a
LINE 170: sliding sound and an exclamation of "What the deuce is to do now?" and
LINE 171: a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down;
LINE 172: they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog
LINE 173: came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing
LINE 174: the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which
LINE 175: was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate
LINE 176: group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no
LINE 177: other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the
LINE 178: traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His
LINE 179: efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I
LINE 180: asked him the question—
LINE 181: "Are you injured, sir?"
LINE 182: I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was
LINE 183: pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me
LINE 184: directly.
LINE 185: "Can I do anything?" I asked again.
LINE 186: "You must just stand on one side," he answered as he rose, first to his
LINE 187: knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,
LINE 188: stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which
LINE 189: removed me effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven
LINE 190: quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse
LINE 191: was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a "Down, Pilot!" The
LINE 192: traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether
LINE 193: they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the
LINE 194: stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.
LINE 195: I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for
LINE 196: I now drew near him again.
LINE 197: "If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from
LINE 198: Thornfield Hall or from Hay."
LINE 199: "Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;" and
LINE 200: again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an
LINE 201: involuntary "Ugh!"
LINE 202: Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I
LINE 203: could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur
LINE 204: collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced
LINE 205: the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.
LINE 206: He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and
LINE 207: gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past
LINE 208: youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.
LINE 209: I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome,
LINE 210: heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus
LINE 211: questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I
LINE 212: had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.
LINE 213: I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance,
LINE 214: gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in
LINE 215: masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither
LINE 216: had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have
LINE 217: shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is
LINE 218: bright but antipathetic.
LINE 219: If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I
LINE 220: addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with
LINE 221: thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew
LINE 222: inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my
LINE 223: ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—
LINE 224: "I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this
LINE 225: solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse."
LINE 226: He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my
LINE 227: direction before.
LINE 228: "I should think you ought to be at home yourself," said he, "if you
LINE 229: have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?"
LINE 230: "From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it
LINE 231: is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish
LINE 232: it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter."
LINE 233: "You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?"
LINE 234: pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,
LINE 235: bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with
LINE 236: the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.
LINE 237: "Yes, sir."
LINE 238: "Whose house is it?"
LINE 239: "Mr. Rochester's."
LINE 240: "Do you know Mr. Rochester?"
LINE 241: "No, I have never seen him."
LINE 242: "He is not resident, then?"
LINE 243: "No."
LINE 244: "Can you tell me where he is?"
LINE 245: "I cannot."
LINE 246: "You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—" He stopped,
LINE 247: ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black
LINE 248: merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough
LINE 249: for a lady's-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped
LINE 250: him.
LINE 251: "I am the governess."
LINE 252: "Ah, the governess!" he repeated; "deuce take me, if I had not
LINE 253: forgotten! The governess!" and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In
LINE 254: two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he
LINE 255: tried to move.
LINE 256: "I cannot commission you to fetch help," he said; "but you may help me
LINE 257: a little yourself, if you will be so kind."
LINE 258: "Yes, sir."
LINE 259: "You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?"
LINE 260: "No."
LINE 261: "Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not
LINE 262: afraid?"
LINE 263: I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to
LINE 264: do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and
LINE 265: went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it
LINE 266: was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made
LINE 267: effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of
LINE 268: its trampling fore-feet. The traveller waited and watched for some
LINE 269: time, and at last he laughed.
LINE 270: I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet
LINE 271: "I see," he said, "the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so
LINE 272: all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of
LINE 273: you to come here."
LINE 274: I came. "Excuse me," he continued: "necessity compels me to make you
LINE 275: useful." He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder, and leaning on me with
LINE 276: some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he
LINE 277: mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he
LINE 278: made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.
LINE 279: "Now," said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, "just hand me
LINE 280: my whip; it lies there under the hedge."
LINE 281: I sought it and found it.
LINE 282: "Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast
LINE 283: as you can."
LINE 284: A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then
LINE 285: bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,
LINE 286: "Like heath that, in the wilderness,
LINE 287: The wild wind whirls away."
LINE 288: I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone
LINE 289: for me: it _was_ an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a
LINE 290: sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.
LINE 291: My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to
LINE 292: have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was
LINE 293: yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The
LINE 294: new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of
LINE 295: memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly,
LINE 296: because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong,
LINE 297: and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the
LINE 298: letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all
LINE 299: the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked
LINE 300: round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the
LINE 301: causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like
LINE 302: Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a
LINE 303: pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the
LINE 304: moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among
LINE 305: the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in
LINE 306: the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught
LINE 307: a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I
LINE 308: hurried on.
LINE 309: I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to
LINE 310: return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome
LINE 311: staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil
LINE 312: Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,
LINE 313: was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip
LINE 314: again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too
LINE 315: still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and
LINE 316: ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have
LINE 317: done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain
LINE 318: struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience
LINE 319: to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good
LINE 320: as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a "too easy chair" to
LINE 321: take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my
LINE 322: circumstances, as it would be under his.
LINE 323: I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and
LINE 324: forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I
LINE 325: could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed
LINE 326: drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey hollow filled with rayless
LINE 327: cells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea
LINE 328: absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march;
LINE 329: her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which
LINE 330: she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith,
LINE 331: midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for
LINE 332: those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart
LINE 333: tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to
LINE 334: earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon
LINE 335: and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.
LINE 336: The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze
LINE 337: lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak
LINE 338: staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose
LINE 339: two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate,
LINE 340: glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple
LINE 341: draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance. It
LINE 342: revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it,
LINE 343: and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst
LINE 344: which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.
LINE 345: I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no
LINE 346: candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the
LINE 347: rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and
LINE 348: white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so
LINE 349: like it that I went forward and said—"Pilot," and the thing got up and
LINE 350: came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great
LINE 351: tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not
LINE 352: tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I
LINE 353: wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.
LINE 354: "What dog is this?"
LINE 355: "He came with master."
LINE 356: "With whom?"
LINE 357: "With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived."
LINE 358: "Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?"
LINE 359: "Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for
LINE 360: a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle
LINE 361: is sprained."
LINE 362: "Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?"
LINE 363: "Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice."
LINE 364: "Ah! Bring me a candle will you Leah?"
LINE 365: Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated
LINE 366: the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with
LINE 367: Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I
LINE 368: went upstairs to take off my things.
