LINE 1: Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how
LINE 2: different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and
LINE 3: solitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now
LINE 4: driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was
LINE 5: life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the
LINE 6: gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so
LINE 7: tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
LINE 8: The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance
LINE 9: hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still
LINE 10: when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather
LINE 11: called their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was
LINE 12: broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast
LINE 13: over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied,
LINE 14: in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
LINE 15: I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of
LINE 16: entertainment was proposed: they spoke of "playing charades," but in my
LINE 17: ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in,
LINE 18: the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the
LINE 19: chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester
LINE 20: and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were
LINE 21: running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was
LINE 22: summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in
LINE 23: shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the
LINE 24: third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of
LINE 25: brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace
LINE 26: lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a
LINE 27: selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the
LINE 28: boudoir within the drawing-room.
LINE 29: Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and
LINE 30: was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. "Miss Ingram
LINE 31: is mine, of course," said he: afterwards he named the two Misses
LINE 32: Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I
LINE 33: had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got
LINE 34: loose.
LINE 35: "Will you play?" he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I
LINE 36: rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my
LINE 37: usual seat.
LINE 38: He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which
LINE 39: was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of
LINE 40: the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I
LINE 41: should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the
LINE 42: notion.
LINE 43: "No," I heard her say: "she looks too stupid for any game of the sort."
LINE 44: Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the
LINE 45: bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise
LINE 46: chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table,
LINE 47: lay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr.
LINE 48: Rochester's cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,
LINE 49: rang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her
LINE 50: guardian's party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents
LINE 51: of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the
LINE 52: magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her
LINE 53: head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.
LINE 54: Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while
LINE 55: Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their
LINE 56: stations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it
LINE 57: was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination,
LINE 58: Colonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then
LINE 59: the Colonel called out—
LINE 60: "Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
LINE 61: A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising
LINE 62: displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The
LINE 63: drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the
LINE 64: dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two
LINE 65: back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised
LINE 66: as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded
LINE 67: by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been
LINE 68: transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
LINE 69: Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr.
LINE 70: Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes
LINE 71: and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he
LINE 72: looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the
LINE 73: bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was
LINE 74: attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the
LINE 75: waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her
LINE 76: beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of
LINE 77: supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of
LINE 78: form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the
LINE 79: idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was
LINE 80: doubtless the character she intended to represent.
LINE 81: She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;
LINE 82: she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now
LINE 83: seemed to accost her; to make some request:—"She hasted, let down her
LINE 84: pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink." From the bosom of his robe
LINE 85: he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets
LINE 86: and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid
LINE 87: the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her
LINE 88: looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and
LINE 89: the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were
LINE 90: wanting.
LINE 91: The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they
LINE 92: could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.
LINE 93: Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;"
LINE 94: whereupon the curtain again descended.
LINE 95: On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;
LINE 96: the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and
LINE 97: coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a
LINE 98: deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very
LINE 99: dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all
LINE 100: extinguished.
LINE 101: Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on
LINE 102: his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;
LINE 103: though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose
LINE 104: from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a
LINE 105: scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling
LINE 106: hair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to
LINE 107: his wrists were attached fetters.
LINE 108: "Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
LINE 109: A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their
LINE 110: ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in
LINE 111: Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.
LINE 112: "Do you know," said she, "that, of the three characters, I liked you in
LINE 113: the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a
LINE 114: gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!"
LINE 115: "Is all the soot washed from my face?" he asked, turning it towards
LINE 116: her.
LINE 117: "Alas! yes: the more's the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your
LINE 118: complexion than that ruffian's rouge."
LINE 119: "You would like a hero of the road then?"
LINE 120: "An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian
LINE 121: bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate."
LINE 122: "Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour
LINE 123: since, in the presence of all these witnesses." She giggled, and her
LINE 124: colour rose.
LINE 125: "Now, Dent," continued Mr. Rochester, "it is your turn." And as the
LINE 126: other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss
LINE 127: Ingram placed herself at her leader's right hand; the other diviners
LINE 128: filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the
LINE 129: actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my
LINE 130: attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on
LINE 131: the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.
LINE 132: What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose,
LINE 133: how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see
LINE 134: the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to
LINE 135: Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards
LINE 136: him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against
LINE 137: his cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged
LINE 138: glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle
LINE 139: returns in memory at this moment.
LINE 140: I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I
LINE 141: could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to
LINE 142: notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would
LINE 143: never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his
LINE 144: attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with
LINE 145: the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious
LINE 146: eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object
LINE 147: too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt
LINE 148: sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a
LINE 149: proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed
LINE 150: hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing
LINE 151: rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness,
LINE 152: captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.
LINE 153: There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though
LINE 154: much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender
LINE 155: jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a
LINE 156: woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the
LINE 157: nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss
LINE 158: Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the
LINE 159: feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very
LINE 160: showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant
LINE 161: attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing
LINE 162: bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted
LINE 163: by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to
LINE 164: repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an
LINE 165: opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did
LINE 166: not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were
LINE 167: not in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to
LINE 168: a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing
LINE 169: her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach
LINE 170: her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with
LINE 171: coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these
LINE 172: manifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.
LINE 173: Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his
LINE 174: intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this
LINE 175: guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's
LINE 176: defects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her,
LINE 177: that my ever-torturing pain arose.
LINE 178: I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,
LINE 179: because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given
LINE 180: her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from
LINE 181: him that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve was
LINE 182: touched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she
LINE 183: could not charm him_.
LINE 184: If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and
LINE 185: sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face,
LINE 186: turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss
LINE 187: Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour,
LINE 188: kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two
LINE 189: tigers—jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I
LINE 190: should have admired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for
LINE 191: the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper
LINE 192: would have been my admiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence.
LINE 193: But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at
LINE 194: fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—herself
LINE 195: unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft
LINE 196: launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success,
LINE 197: when her pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what
LINE 198: she wished to allure—to witness _this_, was to be at once under
LINE 199: ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
LINE 200: Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows
LINE 201: that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell
LINE 202: harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have
LINE 203: quivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye,
LINE 204: and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons
LINE 205: a silent conquest might have been won.
LINE 206: "Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so
LINE 207: near to him?" I asked myself. "Surely she cannot truly like him, or not
LINE 208: like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles
LINE 209: so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so
LINE 210: elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by
LINE 211: merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get
LINE 212: nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression
LINE 213: from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting
LINE 214: him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious
LINE 215: arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer
LINE 216: what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without
LINE 217: grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed
LINE 218: one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when
LINE 219: they are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might
LINE 220: be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest
LINE 221: woman the sun shines on."
LINE 222: I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of
LINE 223: marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first
LINE 224: discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man
LINE 225: unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a
LINE 226: wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the
LINE 227: parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or
LINE 228: Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled
LINE 229: into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these
LINE 230: principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as
LINE 231: I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him,
LINE 232: I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very
LINE 233: obviousness of the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by
LINE 234: this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general
LINE 235: adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the
LINE 236: world would act as I wished to act.
LINE 237: But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my
LINE 238: master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a
LINE 239: sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of
LINE 240: his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just
LINE 241: weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The
LINE 242: sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once,
LINE 243: were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was
LINE 244: pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And
LINE 245: as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a
LINE 246: designing or a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful
LINE 247: observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could
LINE 248: fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used
LINE 249: to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst
LINE 250: volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and
LINE 251: seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with
LINE 252: throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to
LINE 253: shun, I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram
LINE 254: happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure,
LINE 255: explore its secrets and analyse their nature.
LINE 256: Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride—saw
LINE 257: only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their
LINE 258: movements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with their
LINE 259: own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram
LINE 260: continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two
LINE 261: turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting
LINE 262: gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on
LINE 263: which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs.
LINE 264: Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes
LINE 265: bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel
LINE 266: Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice
LINE 267: business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang
LINE 268: to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly
LINE 269: to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one
LINE 270: consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal
LINE 271: actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected
LINE 272: with him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was
LINE 273: absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal
LINE 274: over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a
LINE 275: fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.
LINE 276: The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one
LINE 277: day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not
LINE 278: likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had
LINE 279: proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond
LINE 280: Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the
LINE 281: stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were
LINE 282: playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn
LINE 283: sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having
LINE 284: repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and
LINE 285: Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some
LINE 286: sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a
LINE 287: novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a
LINE 288: sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious
LINE 289: hours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then
LINE 290: the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
LINE 291: It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the
LINE 292: hour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the
LINE 293: drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—
LINE 294: "Voilà Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!"
LINE 295: I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others,
LINE 296: too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a
LINE 297: crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible
LINE 298: on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.
LINE 299: "What can possess him to come home in that style?" said Miss Ingram.
LINE 300: "He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and
LINE 301: Pilot was with him:—what has he done with the animals?"
LINE 302: As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so
LINE 303: near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking
LINE 304: of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when
LINE 305: she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement. The
LINE 306: post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman
LINE 307: alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it
LINE 308: was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
LINE 309: "How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!"
LINE 310: (apostrophising Adèle), "who perched you up in the window to give false
LINE 311: intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in
LINE 312: fault.
LINE 313: Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
LINE 314: He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.
LINE 315: "It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam," said he, "when my
LINE 316: friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long
LINE 317: journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate
LINE 318: acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns."
LINE 319: His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being
LINE 320: somewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether
LINE 321: English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester's,—between thirty and
LINE 322: forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a
LINE 323: fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you
LINE 324: detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed
LINE 325: to please. His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was
LINE 326: large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant
LINE 327: life—at least so I thought.
LINE 328: The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till
LINE 329: after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.
LINE 330: But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as
LINE 331: being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and
LINE 332: had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I
LINE 333: never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an
LINE 334: unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power
LINE 335: in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that
LINE 336: aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low,
LINE 337: even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
LINE 338: As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the
LINE 339: girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an
LINE 340: arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as
LINE 341: if he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with
LINE 342: deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between
LINE 343: a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the
LINE 344: rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
LINE 345: He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship
LINE 346: theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage
LINE 347: that "extremes meet."
LINE 348: Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times
LINE 349: scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make
LINE 350: much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary
LINE 351: Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that
LINE 352: reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they
LINE 353: both called him "a beautiful man." Louisa said he was "a love of a
LINE 354: creature," and she "adored him;" and Mary instanced his "pretty little
LINE 355: mouth, and nice nose," as her ideal of the charming.
LINE 356: "And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!" cried Louisa,—"so
LINE 357: smooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and
LINE 358: such a placid eye and smile!"
LINE 359: And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other
LINE 360: side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to
LINE 361: Hay Common.
LINE 362: I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire,
LINE 363: and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then
LINE 364: I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came
LINE 365: from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so
LINE 366: sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the
LINE 367: house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated
LINE 368: the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I
LINE 369: gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted
LINE 370: with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend's dislike of the burning
LINE 371: heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr.
LINE 372: Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought
LINE 373: the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had
LINE 374: never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
LINE 375: I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat
LINE 376: unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as
LINE 377: some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the
LINE 378: fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still
LINE 379: shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out,
LINE 380: stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him in a low
LINE 381: voice, of which I heard only the words, "old woman,"—"quite
LINE 382: troublesome."
LINE 383: "Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself
LINE 384: off," replied the magistrate.
LINE 385: "No—stop!" interrupted Colonel Dent. "Don't send her away, Eshton; we
LINE 386: might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies." And
LINE 387: speaking aloud, he continued—"Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common
LINE 388: to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother
LINE 389: Bunches is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being
LINE 390: brought in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes. Would you
LINE 391: like to see her?"
LINE 392: "Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a
LINE 393: low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!"
LINE 394: "But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady," said the footman; "nor
LINE 395: can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating
LINE 396: her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and
LINE 397: says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in
LINE 398: here."
LINE 399: "What does she want?" asked Mrs. Eshton.
LINE 400: "'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears
LINE 401: she must and will do it."
LINE 402: "What is she like?" inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.
LINE 403: "A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock."
LINE 404: "Why, she's a real sorceress!" cried Frederick Lynn. "Let us have her
LINE 405: in, of course."
LINE 406: "To be sure," rejoined his brother; "it would be a thousand pities to
LINE 407: throw away such a chance of fun."
LINE 408: "My dear boys, what are you thinking about?" exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.
LINE 409: "I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,"
LINE 410: chimed in the Dowager Ingram.
LINE 411: "Indeed, mama, but you can—and will," pronounced the haughty voice of
LINE 412: Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had
LINE 413: sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. "I have a
LINE 414: curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame
LINE 415: forward."
LINE 416: "My darling Blanche! recollect—"
LINE 417: "I do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will—quick,
LINE 418: Sam!"
LINE 419: "Yes—yes—yes!" cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. "Let
LINE 420: her come—it will be excellent sport!"
LINE 421: The footman still lingered. "She looks such a rough one," said he.
LINE 422: "Go!" ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.
LINE 423: Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery
LINE 424: and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
LINE 425: "She won't come now," said he. "She says it's not her mission to appear
LINE 426: before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words). I must show her into a
LINE 427: room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her
LINE 428: one by one."
LINE 429: "You see now, my queenly Blanche," began Lady Ingram, "she encroaches.
LINE 430: Be advised, my angel girl—and—"
LINE 431: "Show her into the library, of course," cut in the "angel girl." "It is
LINE 432: not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean
LINE 433: to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?"
LINE 434: "Yes, ma'am—but she looks such a tinkler."
LINE 435: "Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding."
LINE 436: Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full
LINE 437: flow once more.
LINE 438: "She's ready now," said the footman, as he reappeared. "She wishes to
LINE 439: know who will be her first visitor."
LINE 440: "I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies
LINE 441: go," said Colonel Dent.
LINE 442: "Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming."
LINE 443: Sam went and returned.
LINE 444: "She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble
LINE 445: themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty
LINE 446: suppressing a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and
LINE 447: single."
LINE 448: "By Jove, she has taste!" exclaimed Henry Lynn.
LINE 449: Miss Ingram rose solemnly: "I go first," she said, in a tone which
LINE 450: might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in
LINE 451: the van of his men.
LINE 452: "Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!" was her mama's cry; but
LINE 453: she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which
LINE 454: Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.
LINE 455: A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it "le cas" to wring
LINE 456: her hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for
LINE 457: her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under
LINE 458: their breath, and looked a little frightened.
LINE 459: The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the
LINE 460: library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
LINE 461: Would she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a
LINE 462: glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and
LINE 463: coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to
LINE 464: her seat, and took it in silence.
LINE 465: "Well, Blanche?" said Lord Ingram.
LINE 466: "What did she say, sister?" asked Mary.
LINE 467: "What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?"
LINE 468: demanded the Misses Eshton.
LINE 469: "Now, now, good people," returned Miss Ingram, "don't press upon me.
LINE 470: Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you
LINE 471: seem, by the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to
LINE 472: this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the
LINE 473: house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a
LINE 474: gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of
LINE 475: palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is
LINE 476: gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in
LINE 477: the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened."
LINE 478: Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined
LINE 479: further conversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all
LINE 480: that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker,
LINE 481: more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She
LINE 482: had obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me,
LINE 483: from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,
LINE 484: notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance
LINE 485: to whatever revelations had been made her.
LINE 486: During all that time she never turned a page
LINE 487: Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not
LINE 488: go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened
LINE 489: through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and
LINE 490: fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the
LINE 491: exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from
LINE 492: the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.
LINE 493: Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard
LINE 494: hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and
LINE 495: at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came
LINE 496: running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
LINE 497: "I am sure she is something not right!" they cried, one and all. "She
LINE 498: told us such things! She knows all about us!" and they sank breathless
LINE 499: into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.
LINE 500: Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of
LINE 501: things they had said and done when they were mere children; described
LINE 502: books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that
LINE 503: different relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she had
LINE 504: even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the
LINE 505: name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of
LINE 506: what they most wished for.
LINE 507: Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further
LINE 508: enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,
LINE 509: ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.
LINE 510: The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again
LINE 511: and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning
LINE 512: had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the
LINE 513: younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
LINE 514: In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully
LINE 515: engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I
LINE 516: turned, and saw Sam.
LINE 517: "If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young
LINE 518: single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she
LINE 519: will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is
LINE 520: no one else for it. What shall I tell her?"
LINE 521: "Oh, I will go by all means," I answered: and I was glad of the
LINE 522: unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped
LINE 523: out of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in
LINE 524: one mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door
LINE 525: quietly behind me.
LINE 526: "If you like, miss," said Sam, "I'll wait in the hall for you; and if
LINE 527: she frightens you, just call and I'll come in."
LINE 528: "No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid." Nor was
LINE 529: I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
