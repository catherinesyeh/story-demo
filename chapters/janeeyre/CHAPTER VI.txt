LINE 1: The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;
LINE 2: but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of
LINE 3: washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place
LINE 4: in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,
LINE 5: whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long,
LINE 6: had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to
LINE 7: ice.
LINE 8: Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over,
LINE 9: I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this
LINE 10: morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the
LINE 11: quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been
LINE 12: doubled.
LINE 13: In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class,
LINE 14: and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had
LINE 15: only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become
LINE 16: an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart,
LINE 17: the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change
LINE 18: from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three
LINE 19: o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of
LINE 20: muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me
LINE 21: to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the
LINE 22: same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one
LINE 23: class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was
LINE 24: quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the
LINE 25: manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or
LINE 26: commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English
LINE 27: history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah:
LINE 28: at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the
LINE 29: class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to
LINE 30: stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure
LINE 31: position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant
LINE 32: notice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the
LINE 33: following:—
LINE 34: "Burns" (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by
LINE 35: their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), "Burns, you are standing on the
LINE 36: side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately." "Burns, you poke
LINE 37: your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in." "Burns, I insist on your
LINE 38: holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,"
LINE 39: &c. &c.
LINE 40: A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the
LINE 41: girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles
LINE 42: I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and
LINE 43: ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every
LINE 44: little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her
LINE 45: memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and
LINE 46: she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss
LINE 47: Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she
LINE 48: suddenly cried out—
LINE 49: "You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this
LINE 50: morning!"
LINE 51: Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.
LINE 52: "Why," thought I, "does she not explain that she could neither clean
LINE 53: her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?"
LINE 54: My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a
LINE 55: skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time
LINE 56: to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I
LINE 57: could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not
LINE 58: pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements. When I returned
LINE 59: to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not
LINE 60: catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into
LINE 61: the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a
LINE 62: minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one
LINE 63: end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a
LINE 64: respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed
LINE 65: her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her
LINE 66: neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns'
LINE 67: eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at
LINE 68: this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a
LINE 69: feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.
LINE 70: "Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of
LINE 71: your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
LINE 72: Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the
LINE 73: book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her
LINE 74: pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.
LINE 75: The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the
LINE 76: day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at
LINE 77: five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the
LINE 78: long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer
LINE 79: than in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more
LINE 80: brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet
LINE 81: introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of
LINE 82: many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.
LINE 83: On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her
LINE 84: pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and
LINE 85: laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I
LINE 86: passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it
LINE 87: snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;
LINE 88: putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the
LINE 89: gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
LINE 90: Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would
LINE 91: have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the
LINE 92: separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure
LINE 93: chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a
LINE 94: strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to
LINE 95: howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to
LINE 96: rise to clamour.
LINE 97: Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of
LINE 98: the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found
LINE 99: Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the
LINE 100: companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
LINE 101: "Is it still 'Rasselas'?" I asked, coming behind her.
LINE 102: "Yes," she said, "and I have just finished it."
LINE 103: And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.
LINE 104: "Now," thought I, "I can perhaps get her to talk." I sat down by her on
LINE 105: the floor.
LINE 106: "What is your name besides Burns?"
LINE 107: "Helen."
LINE 108: "Do you come a long way from here?"
LINE 109: "I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
LINE 110: "Will you ever go back?"
LINE 111: "I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future."
LINE 112: "You must wish to leave Lowood?"
LINE 113: "No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it
LINE 114: would be of no use going away until I have attained that object."
LINE 115: "But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?"
LINE 116: "Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults."
LINE 117: "And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her.
LINE 118: If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should
LINE 119: break it under her nose."
LINE 120: "Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr.
LINE 121: Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great
LINE 122: grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart
LINE 123: which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose
LINE 124: evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides,
LINE 125: the Bible bids us return good for evil."
LINE 126: "But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand
LINE 127: in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl:
LINE 128: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it."
LINE 129: "Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is
LINE 130: weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be
LINE 131: required to bear."
LINE 132: I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of
LINE 133: endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the
LINE 134: forbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen
LINE 135: Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected
LINE 136: she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter
LINE 137: deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
LINE 138: "You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very
LINE 139: good."
LINE 140: "Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss
LINE 141: Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things in
LINE 142: order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my
LINE 143: lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot
LINE 144: _bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very
LINE 145: provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and
LINE 146: particular."
LINE 147: "And cross and cruel," I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my
LINE 148: addition: she kept silence.
LINE 149: "Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?"
LINE 150: At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her
LINE 151: grave face.
LINE 152: "Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one,
LINE 153: even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them
LINE 154: gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed
LINE 155: liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that
LINE 156: even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to
LINE 157: cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most
LINE 158: highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight."
LINE 159: "That is curious," said I, "it is so easy to be careful."
LINE 160: "For _you_ I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this
LINE 161: morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed
LINE 162: to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.
LINE 163: Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss
LINE 164: Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the
LINE 165: very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think
LINE 166: I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the
LINE 167: bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our
LINE 168: house;—then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened;
LINE 169: and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the
LINE 170: visionary brook, I have no answer ready."
LINE 171: "Yet how well you replied this afternoon."
LINE 172: "It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had
LINE 173: interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was
LINE 174: wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and
LINE 175: unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity
LINE 176: it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no
LINE 177: farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to
LINE 178: look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age
LINE 179: was tending! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor
LINE 180: murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they
LINE 181: had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!"
LINE 182: Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very
LINE 183: well understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject
LINE 184: she discussed. I recalled her to my level.
LINE 185: "And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?"
LINE 186: "No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something
LINE 187: to say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is
LINE 188: singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is
LINE 189: often just what I wished to gain."
LINE 190: "Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?"
LINE 191: "Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination
LINE 192: guides me. There is no merit in such goodness."
LINE 193: "A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I
LINE 194: ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who
LINE 195: are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own
LINE 196: way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but
LINE 197: would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we
LINE 198: should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to
LINE 199: teach the person who struck us never to do it again."
LINE 200: "You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are
LINE 201: but a little untaught girl."
LINE 202: "But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to
LINE 203: please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me
LINE 204: unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show me
LINE 205: affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved."
LINE 206: "Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and
LINE 207: civilised nations disown it."
LINE 208: "How? I don't understand."
LINE 209: "It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor vengeance that most
LINE 210: certainly heals injury."
LINE 211: "What then?"
LINE 212: "Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts;
LINE 213: make His word your rule, and His conduct your example."
LINE 214: "What does He say?"
LINE 215: "Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that
LINE 216: hate you and despitefully use you."
LINE 217: "Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her
LINE 218: son John, which is impossible."
LINE 219: In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith
LINE 220: to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
LINE 221: Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve
LINE 222: or softening.
LINE 223: Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she would then make a
LINE 224: remark, but she said nothing.
LINE 225: "Well," I asked impatiently, "is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad
LINE 226: woman?"
LINE 227: "She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes
LINE 228: your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely
LINE 229: you remember all she has done and said to you! What a singularly deep
LINE 230: impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage
LINE 231: so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you
LINE 232: tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it
LINE 233: excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity
LINE 234: or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with
LINE 235: faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we
LINE 236: shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when
LINE 237: debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh,
LINE 238: and only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle
LINE 239: of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the
LINE 240: creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be
LINE 241: communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through
LINE 242: gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the
LINE 243: seraph! Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to
LINE 244: degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another
LINE 245: creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in
LINE 246: which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it
LINE 247: makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.
LINE 248: Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the
LINE 249: criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I
LINE 250: abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart,
LINE 251: degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me
LINE 252: too low: I live in calm, looking to the end."
LINE 253: Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this
LINE 254: sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but
LINE 255: rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time
LINE 256: for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up,
LINE 257: exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—
LINE 258: "Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up
LINE 259: your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at
LINE 260: it!"
LINE 261: Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor
LINE 262: without reply as without delay.
