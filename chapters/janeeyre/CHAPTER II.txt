LINE 1: I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which
LINE 2: greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were
LINE 3: disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself;
LINE 4: or rather _out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious
LINE 5: that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange
LINE 6: penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my
LINE 7: desperation, to go all lengths.
LINE 8: "Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."
LINE 9: "For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid. "What shocking conduct,
LINE 10: Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son! Your
LINE 11: young master."
LINE 12: "Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?"
LINE 13: "No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
LINE 14: There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."
LINE 15: They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,
LINE 16: and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a
LINE 17: spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
LINE 18: "If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie. "Miss
LINE 19: Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."
LINE 20: Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This
LINE 21: preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a
LINE 22: little of the excitement out of me.
LINE 23: "Don't take them off," I cried; "I will not stir."
LINE 24: In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.
LINE 25: "Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was
LINE 26: really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot
LINE 27: stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as
LINE 28: incredulous of my sanity.
LINE 29: "She never did so before," at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
LINE 30: "But it was always in her," was the reply. "I've told Missis often my
LINE 31: opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She's an underhand
LINE 32: little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover."
LINE 33: Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—
LINE 34: "You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs.
LINE 35: Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go
LINE 36: to the poorhouse."
LINE 37: I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very
LINE 38: first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This
LINE 39: reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very
LINE 40: painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—
LINE 41: "And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses
LINE 42: Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up
LINE 43: with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have
LINE 44: none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself
LINE 45: agreeable to them."
LINE 46: "What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice,
LINE 47: "you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would
LINE 48: have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will
LINE 49: send you away, I am sure."
LINE 50: "Besides," said Miss Abbot, "God will punish her: He might strike her
LINE 51: dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come,
LINE 52: Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything. Say
LINE 53: your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't
LINE 54: repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and
LINE 55: fetch you away."
LINE 56: They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
LINE 57: The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say
LINE 58: never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead
LINE 59: Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it
LINE 60: contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the
LINE 61: mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with
LINE 62: curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;
LINE 63: the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half
LINE 64: shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;
LINE 65: the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the
LINE 66: walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,
LINE 67: the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out
LINE 68: of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the
LINE 69: piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy
LINE 70: Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned
LINE 71: easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool
LINE 72: before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
LINE 73: This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,
LINE 74: because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was
LINE 75: known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on
LINE 76: Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet
LINE 77: dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the
LINE 78: contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored
LINE 79: divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased
LINE 80: husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the
LINE 81: spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.
LINE 82: Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed
LINE 83: his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the
LINE 84: undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration
LINE 85: had guarded it from frequent intrusion.
LINE 86: My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,
LINE 87: was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before
LINE 88: me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued,
LINE 89: broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the
LINE 90: muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant
LINE 91: majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had
LINE 92: locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas!
LINE 93: yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the
LINE 94: looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it
LINE 95: revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in
LINE 96: reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white
LINE 97: face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving
LINE 98: where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it
LINE 99: like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening
LINE 100: stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and
LINE 101: appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my
LINE 102: stool.
LINE 103: Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour
LINE 104: for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted
LINE 105: slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a
LINE 106: rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal
LINE 107: present.
LINE 108: All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his sisters' proud indifference,
LINE 109: all his mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in
LINE 110: my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I
LINE 111: always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever
LINE 112: condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win
LINE 113: any one's favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.
LINE 114: Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and
LINE 115: insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink
LINE 116: cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at
LINE 117: her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted,
LINE 118: much less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed
LINE 119: the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse
LINE 120: vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the
LINE 121: conservatory: he called his mother "old girl," too; sometimes reviled
LINE 122: her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her
LINE 123: wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was
LINE 124: still "her own darling." I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil
LINE 125: every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking,
LINE 126: from morning to noon, and from noon to night.
LINE 127: My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no
LINE 128: one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had
LINE 129: turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded
LINE 130: with general opprobrium.
LINE 131: "Unjust!—unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into
LINE 132: precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up,
LINE 133: instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable
LINE 134: oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never
LINE 135: eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
LINE 136: What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my
LINE 137: brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what
LINE 138: darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could
LINE 139: not answer the ceaseless inward question—_why_ I thus suffered; now, at
LINE 140: the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
LINE 141: I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had
LINE 142: nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her children, or her chosen
LINE 143: vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them.
LINE 144: They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not
LINE 145: sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to
LINE 146: them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing,
LINE 147: incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a
LINE 148: noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment,
LINE 149: of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine,
LINE 150: brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally
LINE 151: dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more
LINE 152: complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the
LINE 153: cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone
LINE 154: to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
LINE 155: Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and
LINE 156: the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain
LINE 157: still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind
LINE 158: howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a
LINE 159: stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,
LINE 160: self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying
LINE 161: ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had
LINE 162: I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly
LINE 163: was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel
LINE 164: of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? In such vault I had been told
LINE 165: did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I
LINE 166: dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew
LINE 167: that he was my own uncle—my mother's brother—that he had taken me when
LINE 168: a parentless infant to his house; and that in his last moments he had
LINE 169: required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as
LINE 170: one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept
LINE 171: this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would
LINE 172: permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her
LINE 173: race, and unconnected with her, after her husband's death, by any tie?
LINE 174: It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung
LINE 175: pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could
LINE 176: not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her
LINE 177: own family group.
LINE 178: A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not—never doubted—that if
LINE 179: Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I
LINE 180: sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also
LINE 181: turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to
LINE 182: recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the
LINE 183: violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the
LINE 184: perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit,
LINE 185: harassed by the wrongs of his sister's child, might quit its
LINE 186: abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the
LINE 187: departed—and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and
LINE 188: hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a
LINE 189: preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed
LINE 190: face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in
LINE 191: theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I
LINE 192: endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from
LINE 193: my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;
LINE 194: at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a
LINE 195: ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight
LINE 196: was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling
LINE 197: and quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this
LINE 198: streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried
LINE 199: by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for
LINE 200: horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift
LINE 201: darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My
LINE 202: heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I
LINE 203: deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed,
LINE 204: suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the
LINE 205: lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage;
LINE 206: the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.
LINE 207: "Miss Eyre, are you ill?" said Bessie.
LINE 208: "What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!" exclaimed Abbot.
LINE 209: "Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!" was my cry.
LINE 210: "What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?" again demanded
LINE 211: Bessie.
LINE 212: "Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come." I had now got
LINE 213: hold of Bessie's hand, and she did not snatch it from me.
LINE 214: "She has screamed out on purpose," declared Abbot, in some disgust.
LINE 215: "And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have
LINE 216: excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her
LINE 217: naughty tricks."
LINE 218: "What is all this?" demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed
LINE 219: came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling
LINE 220: stormily. "Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre
LINE 221: should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself."
LINE 222: "Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
LINE 223: "Let her go," was the only answer. "Loose Bessie's hand, child: you
LINE 224: cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor
LINE 225: artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that
LINE 226: tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it
LINE 227: is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall
LINE 228: liberate you then."
LINE 229: "O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it—let me be punished
LINE 230: some other way! I shall be killed if—"
LINE 231: "Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:" and so, no doubt, she
LINE 232: felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked
LINE 233: on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous
LINE 234: duplicity.
LINE 235: Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now
LINE 236: frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me
LINE 237: in, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after
LINE 238: she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed
LINE 239: the scene.
