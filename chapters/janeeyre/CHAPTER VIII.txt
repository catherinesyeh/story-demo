LINE 1: Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and
LINE 2: all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it
LINE 3: was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The
LINE 4: spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction
LINE 5: took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I
LINE 6: sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was
LINE 7: not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and
LINE 8: my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so
LINE 9: much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win
LINE 10: affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had
LINE 11: reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss
LINE 12: Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing,
LINE 13: and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement
LINE 14: two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils;
LINE 15: treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any;
LINE 16: now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise
LINE 17: more?
LINE 18: "Never," I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out
LINE 19: this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again
LINE 20: Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the
LINE 21: long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.
LINE 22: "Come, eat something," she said; but I put both away from me, feeling
LINE 23: as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.
LINE 24: Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my
LINE 25: agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down
LINE 26: on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her
LINE 27: head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I
LINE 28: was the first who spoke—
LINE 29: "Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a
LINE 30: liar?"
LINE 31: "Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you
LINE 32: called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions."
LINE 33: "But what have I to do with millions? The eighty I know despise me."
LINE 34: "Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises
LINE 35: or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much."
LINE 36: "How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?"
LINE 37: "Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:
LINE 38: he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had
LINE 39: he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,
LINE 40: declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would
LINE 41: offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly
LINE 42: on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their
LINE 43: hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere
LINE 44: long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
LINE 45: Besides, Jane"—she paused.
LINE 46: "Well, Helen?" said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers
LINE 47: gently to warm them, and went on—
LINE 48: "If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own
LINE 49: conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be
LINE 50: without friends."
LINE 51: "No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if
LINE 52: others don't love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be
LINE 53: solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from
LINE 54: you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly
LINE 55: submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or
LINE 56: to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—"
LINE 57: "Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are
LINE 58: too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your
LINE 59: frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than
LINE 60: your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth,
LINE 61: and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom
LINE 62: of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those
LINE 63: spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were
LINE 64: dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred
LINE 65: crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if
LINE 66: innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst
LINE 67: has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I
LINE 68: read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and
LINE 69: God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a
LINE 70: full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress,
LINE 71: when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to
LINE 72: happiness—to glory?"
LINE 73: I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted
LINE 74: there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of
LINE 75: woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having
LINE 76: done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I
LINE 77: momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.
LINE 78: Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she
LINE 79: drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus,
LINE 80: when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a
LINE 81: rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in
LINE 82: through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching
LINE 83: figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
LINE 84: "I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre," said she; "I want you in my
LINE 85: room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too."
LINE 86: We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some
LINE 87: intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her
LINE 88: apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple
LINE 89: told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the
LINE 90: hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.
LINE 91: "Is it all over?" she asked, looking down at my face. "Have you cried
LINE 92: your grief away?"
LINE 93: "I am afraid I never shall do that."
LINE 94: "Why?"
LINE 95: "Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody
LINE 96: else, will now think me wicked."
LINE 97: "We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue
LINE 98: to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
LINE 99: "Shall I, Miss Temple?"
LINE 100: "You will," said she, passing her arm round me. "And now tell me who is
LINE 101: the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?"
LINE 102: "Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her
LINE 103: care."
LINE 104: "Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?"
LINE 105: "No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have
LINE 106: often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that
LINE 107: she would always keep me."
LINE 108: "Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a
LINE 109: criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.
LINE 110: You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as
LINE 111: you can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and
LINE 112: exaggerate nothing."
LINE 113: I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most
LINE 114: moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to
LINE 115: arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my
LINE 116: sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than
LINE 117: it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of
LINE 118: Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into
LINE 119: the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus
LINE 120: restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went
LINE 121: on that Miss Temple fully believed me.
LINE 122: In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to
LINE 123: see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode
LINE 124: of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some
LINE 125: degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection
LINE 126: the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my
LINE 127: wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark
LINE 128: and haunted chamber.
LINE 129: I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she
LINE 130: then said—
LINE 131: "I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply
LINE 132: agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every
LINE 133: imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now."
LINE 134: She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well
LINE 135: contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the
LINE 136: contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her
LINE 137: white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark
LINE 138: eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.
LINE 139: "How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?"
LINE 140: "Not quite so much, I think, ma'am."
LINE 141: "And the pain in your chest?"
LINE 142: "It is a little better."
LINE 143: Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she
LINE 144: returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She
LINE 145: was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—
LINE 146: "But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such." She
LINE 147: rang her bell.
LINE 148: "Barbara," she said to the servant who answered it, "I have not yet had
LINE 149: tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies."
LINE 150: And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups
LINE 151: and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
LINE 152: How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
LINE 153: of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)
LINE 154: discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
LINE 155: "Barbara," said she, "can you not bring a little more bread and butter?
LINE 156: There is not enough for three."
LINE 157: Barbara went out: she returned soon—
LINE 158: "Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity."
LINE 159: Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.
LINE 160: Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
LINE 161: "Oh, very well!" returned Miss Temple; "we must make it do, Barbara, I
LINE 162: suppose." And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I
LINE 163: have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
LINE 164: Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before
LINE 165: each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast,
LINE 166: she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in
LINE 167: paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
LINE 168: "I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you," said she,
LINE 169: "but as there is so little toast, you must have it now," and she
LINE 170: proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
LINE 171: We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least
LINE 172: delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which
LINE 173: our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the
LINE 174: delicate fare she liberally supplied.
LINE 175: Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we
LINE 176: sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between
LINE 177: her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
LINE 178: Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in
LINE 179: her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded
LINE 180: deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which
LINE 181: chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,
LINE 182: by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to
LINE 183: Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.
LINE 184: The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of
LINE 185: her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something
LINE 186: in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke,
LINE 187: they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which
LINE 188: till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone
LINE 189: in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty
LINE 190: more singular than that of Miss Temple's—a beauty neither of fine
LINE 191: colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of
LINE 192: movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language
LINE 193: flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart
LINE 194: large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure,
LINE 195: full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen's
LINE 196: discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed
LINE 197: hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during
LINE 198: a protracted existence.
LINE 199: They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times
LINE 200: past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed
LINE 201: at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of
LINE 202: knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French
LINE 203: names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss
LINE 204: Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the
LINE 205: Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade
LINE 206: her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of
LINE 207: veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished
LINE 208: ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple
LINE 209: embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—
LINE 210: "God bless you, my children!"
LINE 211: Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more
LINE 212: reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was for her
LINE 213: she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from
LINE 214: her cheek.
LINE 215: On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was
LINE 216: examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we
LINE 217: entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that
LINE 218: to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles
LINE 219: pinned to her shoulder.
LINE 220: "My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in
LINE 221: a low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
LINE 222: Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece
LINE 223: of pasteboard the word "Slattern," and bound it like a phylactery round
LINE 224: Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead. She wore
LINE 225: it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved
LINE 226: punishment. The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school,
LINE 227: I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of
LINE 228: which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears,
LINE 229: hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the
LINE 230: spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the
LINE 231: heart.
LINE 232: About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple,
LINE 233: who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that
LINE 234: what he said went to corroborate my account. Miss Temple, having
LINE 235: assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into
LINE 236: the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to
LINE 237: be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. The
LINE 238: teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of
LINE 239: pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.
LINE 240: Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,
LINE 241: resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty: I toiled hard, and
LINE 242: my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally
LINE 243: tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few
LINE 244: weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was
LINE 245: allowed to commence French and drawing. I learned the first two tenses
LINE 246: of the verb _Etre_, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls,
LINE 247: by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa),
LINE 248: on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in
LINE 249: imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread
LINE 250: and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I
LINE 251: feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the
LINE 252: dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees,
LINE 253: picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet
LINE 254: paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking
LINE 255: at ripe cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed
LINE 256: about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the
LINE 257: possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain
LINE 258: little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was
LINE 259: that problem solved to my satisfaction ere I fell sweetly asleep.
LINE 260: Well has Solomon said—"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than
LINE 261: a stalled ox and hatred therewith."
LINE 262: I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for
LINE 263: Gateshead and its daily luxuries.
