LINE 1: The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very
LINE 2: dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but
LINE 3: few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small
LINE 4: room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on
LINE 5: it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been
LINE 6: almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change
LINE 7: from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one
LINE 8: entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could
LINE 9: understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could
LINE 10: not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
LINE 11: Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed
LINE 12: me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not
LINE 13: understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.
LINE 14: Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would
LINE 15: whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside—
LINE 16: "It is very well we took her in."
LINE 17: "Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the
LINE 18: morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone
LINE 19: through?"
LINE 20: "Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!"
LINE 21: "She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of
LINE 22: speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off,
LINE 23: though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine."
LINE 24: "She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like
LINE 25: it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy
LINE 26: would be agreeable."
LINE 27: Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the
LINE 28: hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion
LINE 29: to, myself. I was comforted.
LINE 30: Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of
LINE 31: lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted
LINE 32: fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was
LINE 33: sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been
LINE 34: overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a
LINE 35: while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid
LINE 36: enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words,
LINE 37: in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man
LINE 38: little accustomed to expansive comment, "Rather an unusual physiognomy;
LINE 39: certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation."
LINE 40: "Far otherwise," responded Diana. "To speak truth, St. John, my heart
LINE 41: rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit
LINE 42: her permanently."
LINE 43: "That is hardly likely," was the reply. "You will find she is some
LINE 44: young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has
LINE 45: probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring
LINE 46: her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her
LINE 47: face which make me sceptical of her tractability." He stood considering
LINE 48: me some minutes; then added, "She looks sensible, but not at all
LINE 49: handsome."
LINE 50: "She is so ill, St. John."
LINE 51: "Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of
LINE 52: beauty are quite wanting in those features."
LINE 53: On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise
LINE 54: in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast,
LINE 55: about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the
LINE 56: food was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned
LINE 57: what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and
LINE 58: revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. I
LINE 59: wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired
LINE 60: apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. I
LINE 61: felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the
LINE 62: humiliation.
LINE 63: On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My
LINE 64: black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were
LINE 65: removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite
LINE 66: decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered
LINE 67: presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb
LINE 68: and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every
LINE 69: five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on
LINE 70: me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and
LINE 71: once more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace
LINE 72: of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—I
LINE 73: crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow
LINE 74: low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
LINE 75: It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous
LINE 76: fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most
LINE 77: difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been
LINE 78: loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds
LINE 79: among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first:
LINE 80: latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in
LINE 81: tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.
LINE 82: "What, you have got up!" she said. "You are better, then. You may sit
LINE 83: you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will."
LINE 84: She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about,
LINE 85: examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to
LINE 86: me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—
LINE 87: "Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?"
LINE 88: I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the
LINE 89: question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered
LINE 90: quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—
LINE 91: "You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more
LINE 92: than yourself or your young ladies."
LINE 93: After a pause she said, "I dunnut understand that: you've like no
LINE 94: house, nor no brass, I guess?"
LINE 95: "The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does
LINE 96: not make a beggar in your sense of the word."
LINE 97: "Are you book-learned?" she inquired presently.
LINE 98: "Yes, very."
LINE 99: "But you've never been to a boarding-school?"
LINE 100: "I was at a boarding-school eight years."
LINE 101: She opened her eyes wide. "Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?"
LINE 102: "I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are
LINE 103: you going to do with these gooseberries?" I inquired, as she brought
LINE 104: out a basket of the fruit.
LINE 105: "Mak' 'em into pies."
LINE 106: "Give them to me and I'll pick them."
LINE 107: "Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought."
LINE 108: "But I must do something. Let me have them."
LINE 109: She consented; and she even brought me a clean towel to spread over my
LINE 110: dress, "lest," as she said, "I should mucky it."
LINE 111: "Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands," she
LINE 112: remarked. "Happen ye've been a dressmaker?"
LINE 113: "No, you are wrong. And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble
LINE 114: your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we
LINE 115: are."
LINE 116: "Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House."
LINE 117: "And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?"
LINE 118: "Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while. When he is at
LINE 119: home, he is in his own parish at Morton."
LINE 120: "That village a few miles off?
LINE 121: "Aye."
LINE 122: "And what is he?"
LINE 123: "He is a parson."
LINE 124: I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I
LINE 125: had asked to see the clergyman. "This, then, was his father's
LINE 126: residence?"
LINE 127: "Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and
LINE 128: gurt (great) grandfather afore him."
LINE 129: "The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?"
LINE 130: "Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name."
LINE 131: "And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?"
LINE 132: "Yes."
LINE 133: "Their father is dead?"
LINE 134: "Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke."
LINE 135: "They have no mother?"
LINE 136: "The mistress has been dead this mony a year."
LINE 137: "Have you lived with the family long?"
LINE 138: "I've lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three."
LINE 139: "That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant. I will
LINE 140: say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a
LINE 141: beggar."
LINE 142: She again regarded me with a surprised stare. "I believe," she said, "I
LINE 143: was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats
LINE 144: goes about, you mun forgie me."
LINE 145: "And though," I continued, rather severely, "you wished to turn me from
LINE 146: the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog."
LINE 147: "Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o' th'
LINE 148: childer nor of mysel: poor things! They've like nobody to tak' care on
LINE 149: 'em but me. I'm like to look sharpish."
LINE 150: I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
LINE 151: "You munnut think too hardly of me," she again remarked.
LINE 152: "But I do think hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why—not so
LINE 153: much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an
LINE 154: impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I
LINE 155: had no 'brass' and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived
LINE 156: have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought
LINE 157: not to consider poverty a crime."
LINE 158: "No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I
LINE 159: wor wrang—but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
LINE 160: You look a raight down dacent little crater."
LINE 161: "That will do—I forgive you now. Shake hands."
LINE 162: She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile
LINE 163: illumined her rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
LINE 164: Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she
LINE 165: made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details
LINE 166: about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she
LINE 167: called the young people.
LINE 168: Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and
LINE 169: of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the
LINE 170: Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, "aboon two
LINE 171: hundred year old—for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to
LINE 172: compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale. But she could
LINE 173: remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers
LINE 174: wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by
LINE 175: looking into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry." Still, she
LINE 176: allowed, "the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o' t'
LINE 177: common way: stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like." The
LINE 178: mistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and
LINE 179: the "bairns" had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these
LINE 180: parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost
LINE 181: from the time they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of
LINE 182: their own." Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a
LINE 183: parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places
LINE 184: as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago
LINE 185: lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt;
LINE 186: and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must
LINE 187: provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long
LINE 188: while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their
LINE 189: father's death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all
LINE 190: these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many other
LINE 191: grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and
LINE 192: then they were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor
LINE 193: "threaped." She did not know where there was such a family for being
LINE 194: united.
LINE 195: Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two
LINE 196: ladies and their brother were now.
LINE 197: "Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour
LINE 198: to tea."
LINE 199: They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by
LINE 200: the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed
LINE 201: through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and
LINE 202: calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be
LINE 203: able to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.
LINE 204: "You should have waited for my leave to descend," she said. "You still
LINE 205: look very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!"
LINE 206: Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She
LINE 207: possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face
LINE 208: seemed to me full of charm. Mary's countenance was equally
LINE 209: intelligent—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more
LINE 210: reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked
LINE 211: and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently. It was
LINE 212: my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like
LINE 213: hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to
LINE 214: an active will.
LINE 215: "And what business have you here?" she continued. "It is not your
LINE 216: place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like
LINE 217: to be free, even to license—but you are a visitor, and must go into the
LINE 218: parlour."
LINE 219: "I am very well here."
LINE 220: "Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour."
LINE 221: "Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
LINE 222: "To be sure," added her sister. "Come, you must be obedient." And still
LINE 223: holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
LINE 224: "Sit there," she said, placing me on the sofa, "while we take our
LINE 225: things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise
LINE 226: in our little moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so
LINE 227: inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing."
LINE 228: She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat
LINE 229: opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined, first, the
LINE 230: parlour, and then its occupant.
LINE 231: The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet
LINE 232: comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very
LINE 233: bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few
LINE 234: strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated
LINE 235: the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and
LINE 236: an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the
LINE 237: room—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a
LINE 238: lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:
LINE 239: everything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn
LINE 240: and well saved.
LINE 241: Mr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the
LINE 242: walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips
LINE 243: mutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead
LINE 244: of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young—perhaps from
LINE 245: twenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was
LINE 246: like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic
LINE 247: nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an
LINE 248: English face comes so near the antique models as did his. He might well
LINE 249: be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being
LINE 250: so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his
LINE 251: high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by
LINE 252: careless locks of fair hair.
LINE 253: This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it
LINE 254: describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,
LINE 255: an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat,
LINE 256: there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to
LINE 257: my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or
LINE 258: eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one
LINE 259: glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in
LINE 260: the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top
LINE 261: of the oven.
LINE 262: "Eat that now," she said: "you must be hungry. Hannah says you have had
LINE 263: nothing but some gruel since breakfast."
LINE 264: I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers
LINE 265: now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat,
LINE 266: fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an
LINE 267: unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his
LINE 268: gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto
LINE 269: kept it averted from the stranger.
LINE 270: "You are very hungry," he said.
LINE 271: "I am, sir." It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to
LINE 272: meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
LINE 273: "It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the
LINE 274: last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the
LINE 275: cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not
LINE 276: immoderately."
LINE 277: "I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir," was my very
LINE 278: clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.
LINE 279: "No," he said coolly: "when you have indicated to us the residence of
LINE 280: your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home."
LINE 281: "That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being
LINE 282: absolutely without home and friends."
LINE 283: The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no
LINE 284: suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak
LINE 285: particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes, though clear enough
LINE 286: in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He
LINE 287: seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's
LINE 288: thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of
LINE 289: keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than
LINE 290: to encourage.
LINE 291: "Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you are completely isolated from
LINE 292: every connection?"
LINE 293: "I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess
LINE 294: to admittance under any roof in England."
LINE 295: "A most singular position at your age!"
LINE 296: Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the
LINE 297: table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon
LINE 298: explained the quest.
LINE 299: "You have never been married? You are a spinster?"
LINE 300: Diana laughed. "Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years
LINE 301: old, St. John," said she.
LINE 302: "I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No."
LINE 303: I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating
LINE 304: recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw
LINE 305: the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by
LINE 306: turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the
LINE 307: colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had
LINE 308: excited forced out tears as well as colour.
LINE 309: "Where did you last reside?" he now asked.
LINE 310: "You are too inquisitive, St. John," murmured Mary in a low voice; but
LINE 311: he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and
LINE 312: piercing look.
LINE 313: "The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is
LINE 314: my secret," I replied concisely.
LINE 315: "Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both
LINE 316: from St. John and every other questioner," remarked Diana.
LINE 317: "Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,"
LINE 318: he said. "And you need help, do you not?"
LINE 319: "I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist
LINE 320: will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the
LINE 321: remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries
LINE 322: of life."
LINE 323: "I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid
LINE 324: you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell
LINE 325: me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do."
LINE 326: I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage;
LINE 327: as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung
LINE 328: nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge
LINE 329: steadily.
LINE 330: "Mr. Rivers," I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked
LINE 331: at me, openly and without diffidence, "you and your sisters have done
LINE 332: me a great service—the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have
LINE 333: rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit
LINE 334: conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to
LINE 335: a certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the
LINE 336: history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without
LINE 337: compromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical,
LINE 338: and that of others.
LINE 339: "I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I
LINE 340: could know them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable
LINE 341: institution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where
LINE 342: I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan
LINE 343: Asylum, ——shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert
LINE 344: Brocklehurst is the treasurer."
LINE 345: "I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school."
LINE 346: "I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I
LINE 347: obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to
LINE 348: leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot
LINE 349: and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would
LINE 350: sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from
LINE 351: culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a
LINE 352: time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a
LINE 353: paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points
LINE 354: in planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to
LINE 355: leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in
LINE 356: my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that
LINE 357: brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite
LINE 358: destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two
LINE 359: days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did
LINE 360: I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and
LINE 361: despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to
LINE 362: perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your
LINE 363: roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not
LINE 364: been insensible during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their
LINE 365: spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your
LINE 366: evangelical charity."
LINE 367: "Don't make her talk any more now, St. John," said Diana, as I paused;
LINE 368: "she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit
LINE 369: down now, Miss Elliott."
LINE 370: I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had
LINE 371: forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,
LINE 372: noticed it at once.
LINE 373: "You said your name was Jane Elliott?" he observed.
LINE 374: "I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be
LINE 375: called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it
LINE 376: sounds strange to me."
LINE 377: "Your real name you will not give?"
LINE 378: "No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would
LINE 379: lead to it, I avoid."
LINE 380: "You are quite right, I am sure," said Diana. "Now do, brother, let her
LINE 381: be at peace a while."
LINE 382: But when St. John had mused a few moments he recommenced as
LINE 383: imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.
LINE 384: "You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you would
LINE 385: wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion,
LINE 386: and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the
LINE 387: distinction drawn, nor do I resent it—it is just): you desire to be
LINE 388: independent of us?"
LINE 389: "I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek
LINE 390: work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the
LINE 391: meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another
LINE 392: essay of the horrors of homeless destitution."
LINE 393: "Indeed you _shall_ stay here," said Diana, putting her white hand on
LINE 394: my head. "You _shall_," repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative
LINE 395: sincerity which seemed natural to her.
LINE 396: "My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you," said Mr. St.
LINE 397: John, "as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a
LINE 398: half-frozen bird some wintry wind might have driven through their
LINE 399: casement. _I_ feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping
LINE 400: yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is
LINE 401: narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be
LINE 402: of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of
LINE 403: small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can
LINE 404: offer."
LINE 405: "She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she
LINE 406: _can_ do," answered Diana for me; "and you know, St. John, she has no
LINE 407: choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as
LINE 408: you."
LINE 409: "I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a
LINE 410: servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better," I answered.
LINE 411: "Right," said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. "If such is your spirit, I
LINE 412: promise to aid you, in my own time and way."
LINE 413: He now resumed the book with which he had been occupied before tea. I
LINE 414: soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my
LINE 415: present strength would permit.
