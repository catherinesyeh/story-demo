LINE 1: He did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he had said he would.
LINE 2: He deferred his departure a whole week, and during that time he made me
LINE 3: feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet
LINE 4: implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him. Without one
LINE 5: overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he contrived to impress me
LINE 6: momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his
LINE 7: favour.
LINE 8: Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness—not
LINE 9: that he would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in
LINE 10: his power to do so. Both by nature and principle, he was superior to
LINE 11: the mean gratification of vengeance: he had forgiven me for saying I
LINE 12: scorned him and his love, but he had not forgotten the words; and as
LINE 13: long as he and I lived he never would forget them. I saw by his look,
LINE 14: when he turned to me, that they were always written on the air between
LINE 15: me and him; whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his ear, and
LINE 16: their echo toned every answer he gave me.
LINE 17: He did not abstain from conversing with me: he even called me as usual
LINE 18: each morning to join him at his desk; and I fear the corrupt man within
LINE 19: him had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian,
LINE 20: in evincing with what skill he could, while acting and speaking
LINE 21: apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the
LINE 22: spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a
LINE 23: certain austere charm to his language and manner. To me, he was in
LINE 24: reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his eye was a cold, bright,
LINE 25: blue gem; his tongue a speaking instrument—nothing more.
LINE 26: All this was torture to me—refined, lingering torture. It kept up a
LINE 27: slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which
LINE 28: harassed and crushed me altogether. I felt how—if I were his wife, this
LINE 29: good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without
LINE 30: drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own
LINE 31: crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime. Especially I felt this
LINE 32: when I made any attempt to propitiate him. No ruth met my ruth. _He_
LINE 33: experienced no suffering from estrangement—no yearning after
LINE 34: reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears
LINE 35: blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more
LINE 36: effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or
LINE 37: metal. To his sisters, meantime, he was somewhat kinder than usual: as
LINE 38: if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how
LINE 39: completely I was banished and banned, he added the force of contrast;
LINE 40: and this I am sure he did not by malice, but on principle.
LINE 41: The night before he left home, happening to see him walking in the
LINE 42: garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him, that this
LINE 43: man, alienated as he now was, had once saved my life, and that we were
LINE 44: near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his
LINE 45: friendship. I went out and approached him as he stood leaning over the
LINE 46: little gate; I spoke to the point at once.
LINE 47: "St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me. Let us be
LINE 48: friends."
LINE 49: "I hope we are friends," was the unmoved reply; while he still watched
LINE 50: the rising of the moon, which he had been contemplating as I
LINE 51: approached.
LINE 52: "No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that."
LINE 53: "Are we not? That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all
LINE 54: good."
LINE 55: "I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing
LINE 56: any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more
LINE 57: of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere
LINE 58: strangers."
LINE 59: "Of course," he said. "Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from
LINE 60: regarding you as a stranger."
LINE 61: This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling
LINE 62: enough. Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should
LINE 63: immediately have left him; but something worked within me more strongly
LINE 64: than those feelings could. I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and
LINE 65: principle. His friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me
LINE 66: severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
LINE 67: "Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you
LINE 68: leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?"
LINE 69: He now turned quite from the moon and faced me.
LINE 70: "When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you! What! do you not go to
LINE 71: India?"
LINE 72: "You said I could not unless I married you."
LINE 73: "And you will not marry me! You adhere to that resolution?"
LINE 74: Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put
LINE 75: into the ice of their questions? How much of the fall of the avalanche
LINE 76: is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their
LINE 77: displeasure?
LINE 78: "No. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution."
LINE 79: The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet
LINE 80: crash down.
LINE 81: "Once more, why this refusal?" he asked.
LINE 82: "Formerly," I answered, "because you did not love me; now, I reply,
LINE 83: because you almost hate me. If I were to marry you, you would kill me.
LINE 84: You are killing me now."
LINE 85: His lips and cheeks turned white—quite white.
LINE 86: "_I should kill you_—_I am killing you_? Your words are such as ought
LINE 87: not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue. They betray an
LINE 88: unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem
LINE 89: inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even
LINE 90: until seventy-and-seven times."
LINE 91: I had finished the business now. While earnestly wishing to erase from
LINE 92: his mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that
LINE 93: tenacious surface another and far deeper impression: I had burnt it in.
LINE 94: "Now you will indeed hate me," I said. "It is useless to attempt to
LINE 95: conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you."
LINE 96: A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched
LINE 97: on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew
LINE 98: the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung.
LINE 99: "You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand:
LINE 100: "I have no intention to grieve or pain you—indeed, I have not."
LINE 101: Most bitterly he smiled—most decidedly he withdrew his hand from mine.
LINE 102: "And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I
LINE 103: presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
LINE 104: "Yes, I will, as your assistant," I answered.
LINE 105: A very long silence succeeded. What struggle there was in him between
LINE 106: Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams
LINE 107: scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He
LINE 108: spoke at last.
LINE 109: "I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age
LINE 110: proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine. I proved it to you
LINE 111: in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever
LINE 112: again alluding to the plan. That you have done so, I regret—for your
LINE 113: sake."
LINE 114: I interrupted him. Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at
LINE 115: once. "Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense. You
LINE 116: pretend to be shocked by what I have said. You are not really shocked:
LINE 117: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so
LINE 118: conceited as to misunderstand my meaning. I say again, I will be your
LINE 119: curate, if you like, but never your wife."
LINE 120: Again he turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his passion
LINE 121: perfectly. He answered emphatically but calmly—
LINE 122: "A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me. With me,
LINE 123: then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I
LINE 124: will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a
LINE 125: coadjutor. Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's
LINE 126: aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your
LINE 127: promise and deserting the band you engaged to join."
LINE 128: Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise
LINE 129: or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard
LINE 130: and much too despotic for the occasion. I replied—
LINE 131: "There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.
LINE 132: I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with
LINE 133: strangers. With you I would have ventured much, because I admire,
LINE 134: confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go
LINE 135: when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate."
LINE 136: "Ah! you are afraid of yourself," he said, curling his lip.
LINE 137: "I am. God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish
LINE 138: me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
LINE 139: Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will
LINE 140: know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it
LINE 141: than by leaving it."
LINE 142: "What do you mean?"
LINE 143: "It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on
LINE 144: which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by
LINE 145: some means that doubt is removed."
LINE 146: "I know where your heart turns and to what it clings. The interest you
LINE 147: cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have
LINE 148: crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it. You think of Mr.
LINE 149: Rochester?"
LINE 150: It was true. I confessed it by silence.
LINE 151: "Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?"
LINE 152: "I must find out what is become of him."
LINE 153: "It remains for me, then," he said, "to remember you in my prayers, and
LINE 154: to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed
LINE 155: become a castaway. I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen.
LINE 156: But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done—"
LINE 157: He opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen.
LINE 158: He was soon out of sight.
LINE 159: On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window,
LINE 160: looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put
LINE 161: her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.
LINE 162: "Jane," she said, "you are always agitated and pale now. I am sure
LINE 163: there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John and you
LINE 164: have on hands. I have watched you this half hour from the window; you
LINE 165: must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I
LINE 166: hardly know what. St. John is a strange being—"
LINE 167: She paused—I did not speak: soon she resumed—
LINE 168: "That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting
LINE 169: you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest
LINE 170: he never showed to any one else—to what end? I wish he loved you—does
LINE 171: he, Jane?"
LINE 172: I put her cool hand to my hot forehead; "No, Die, not one whit."
LINE 173: "Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so
LINE 174: frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?
LINE 175: Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him."
LINE 176: "He does—he has asked me to be his wife."
LINE 177: Diana clapped her hands. "That is just what we hoped and thought! And
LINE 178: you will marry him, Jane, won't you? And then he will stay in England."
LINE 179: "Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a
LINE 180: fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils."
LINE 181: "What! He wishes you to go to India?"
LINE 182: "Yes."
LINE 183: "Madness!" she exclaimed. "You would not live three months there, I am
LINE 184: certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?"
LINE 185: "I have refused to marry him—"
LINE 186: "And have consequently displeased him?" she suggested.
LINE 187: "Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany
LINE 188: him as his sister."
LINE 189: "It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you
LINE 190: undertook—one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the
LINE 191: strong, and you are weak. St. John—you know him—would urge you to
LINE 192: impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during
LINE 193: the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts,
LINE 194: you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to
LINE 195: refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?"
LINE 196: "Not as a husband."
LINE 197: "Yet he is a handsome fellow."
LINE 198: "And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit."
LINE 199: "Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good,
LINE 200: to be grilled alive in Calcutta." And again she earnestly conjured me
LINE 201: to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
LINE 202: "I must indeed," I said; "for when just now I repeated the offer of
LINE 203: serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of
LINE 204: decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing
LINE 205: to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to
LINE 206: find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such."
LINE 207: "What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?"
LINE 208: "You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again
LINE 209: explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He
LINE 210: has told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no
LINE 211: doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that
LINE 212: I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be
LINE 213: chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?"
LINE 214: "Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!"
LINE 215: "And then," I continued, "though I have only sisterly affection for him
LINE 216: now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of
LINE 217: conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,
LINE 218: because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur
LINE 219: in his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would
LINE 220: become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I
LINE 221: showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a
LINE 222: superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he would."
LINE 223: "And yet St. John is a good man," said Diana.
LINE 224: "He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings
LINE 225: and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is
LINE 226: better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest,
LINE 227: in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I will
LINE 228: leave you, Diana." And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the
LINE 229: garden.
LINE 230: But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he
LINE 231: appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak
LINE 232: to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial
LINE 233: scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed
LINE 234: me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his
LINE 235: ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the
LINE 236: help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and
LINE 237: now believed he had forgiven me once more.
LINE 238: For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first
LINE 239: chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while
LINE 240: from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice
LINE 241: sound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so
LINE 242: impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of
LINE 243: God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more
LINE 244: thrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the
LINE 245: May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering
LINE 246: almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat
LINE 247: there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page
LINE 248: the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come
LINE 249: to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes,
LINE 250: and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor
LINE 251: crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.
LINE 252: The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially
LINE 253: as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in
LINE 254: uttering them, his eye had turned on me.
LINE 255: "He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,
LINE 256: and he shall be my son. But," was slowly, distinctly read, "the
LINE 257: fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which
LINE 258: burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
LINE 259: Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.
LINE 260: A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his
LINE 261: enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader
LINE 262: believed his name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and
LINE 263: he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which
LINE 264: the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need
LINE 265: of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it,
LINE 266: and the Lamb is the light thereof.
LINE 267: In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his
LINE 268: stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and
LINE 269: resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted;
LINE 270: guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh
LINE 271: hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were
LINE 272: luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of
LINE 273: a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn:
LINE 274: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it
LINE 275: continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the
LINE 276: greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard
LINE 277: him plead for it, could not but feel it too.
LINE 278: The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early
LINE 279: hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in
LINE 280: compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my
LINE 281: hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.
LINE 282: "Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a
LINE 283: fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I
LINE 284: listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with
LINE 285: me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to
LINE 286: do all things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so
LINE 287: will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:
LINE 288: repent—resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work
LINE 289: while it is day—warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.'
LINE 290: Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God
LINE 291: give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken
LINE 292: from you!"
LINE 293: He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken
LINE 294: earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding
LINE 295: his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering
LINE 296: sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is
LINE 297: responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;
LINE 298: whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be
LINE 299: sincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt
LINE 300: veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me
LINE 301: at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease
LINE 302: struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf
LINE 303: of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by
LINE 304: him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I
LINE 305: was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of
LINE 306: principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So
LINE 307: I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet
LINE 308: medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
LINE 309: I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch. My refusals were
LINE 310: forgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralysed. The
LINE 311: Impossible—_i.e._, my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the
LINE 312: Possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion
LINE 313: called—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a
LINE 314: scroll—death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that
LINE 315: for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.
LINE 316: The dim room was full of visions.
LINE 317: "Could you decide now?" asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in
LINE 318: gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far
LINE 319: more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew
LINE 320: pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I
LINE 321: yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my
LINE 322: former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn
LINE 323: prayer: it was only elevated.
LINE 324: "I could decide if I were but certain," I answered: "were I but
LINE 325: convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to
LINE 326: marry you here and now—come afterwards what would!"
LINE 327: "My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer
LINE 328: on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm,
LINE 329: _almost_ as if he loved me (I say _almost_—I knew the difference—for I
LINE 330: had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out
LINE 331: of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward
LINE 332: dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply,
LINE 333: fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. "Show me, show me
LINE 334: the path!" I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever
LINE 335: been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader
LINE 336: shall judge.
LINE 337: All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,
LINE 338: were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was
LINE 339: full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
LINE 340: Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it
LINE 341: through, and passed at once to my head and extremities. The feeling was
LINE 342: not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as
LINE 343: startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto
LINE 344: had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to
LINE 345: wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered
LINE 346: on my bones.
LINE 347: "What have you heard? What do you see?" asked St. John. I saw nothing,
LINE 348: but I heard a voice somewhere cry—
LINE 349: "Jane! Jane! Jane!"—nothing more.
LINE 350: "O God! what is it?" I gasped.
LINE 351: I might have said, "Where is it?" for it did not seem in the room—nor
LINE 352: in the house—nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor from
LINE 353: under the earth—nor from overhead. I had heard it—where, or whence, for
LINE 354: ever impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human being—a known,
LINE 355: loved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it
LINE 356: spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
LINE 357: "I am coming!" I cried. "Wait for me! Oh, I will come!" I flew to the
LINE 358: door and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the
LINE 359: garden: it was void.
LINE 360: "Where are you?" I exclaimed.
LINE 361: The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—"Where are
LINE 362: you?" I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland
LINE 363: loneliness and midnight hush.
LINE 364: "Down superstition!" I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the
LINE 365: black yew at the gate. "This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:
LINE 366: it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did—no miracle—but her
LINE 367: best."
LINE 368: I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It
LINE 369: was _my_ time to assume ascendency. _My_ powers were in play and in
LINE 370: force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave
LINE 371: me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy
