LINE 1: From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported
LINE 2: conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to
LINE 3: suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I
LINE 4: desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks
LINE 5: passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion
LINE 6: was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at
LINE 7: times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she
LINE 8: had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her
LINE 9: own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself,
LINE 10: condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the
LINE 11: nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a
LINE 12: hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an
LINE 13: instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same
LINE 14: roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me,
LINE 15: expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.
LINE 16: Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me
LINE 17: as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he
LINE 18: saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned
LINE 19: against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate
LINE 20: revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to
LINE 21: desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst
LINE 22: his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a
LINE 23: blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or
LINE 24: my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my
LINE 25: advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in
LINE 26: a blubbering tone commence the tale of how "that nasty Jane Eyre" had
LINE 27: flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—
LINE 28: "Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she
LINE 29: is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your
LINE 30: sisters should associate with her."
LINE 31: Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at
LINE 32: all deliberating on my words—
LINE 33: "They are not fit to associate with me."
LINE 34: Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and
LINE 35: audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a
LINE 36: whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my
LINE 37: crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter
LINE 38: one syllable during the remainder of the day.
LINE 39: "What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?" was my scarcely
LINE 40: voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my
LINE 41: tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:
LINE 42: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
LINE 43: "What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey
LINE 44: eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my
LINE 45: arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child
LINE 46: or fiend. I was now in for it.
LINE 47: "My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so
LINE 48: can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how
LINE 49: you wish me dead."
LINE 50: Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she
LINE 51: boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied
LINE 52: the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond
LINE 53: a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared
LINE 54: under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings
LINE 55: surging in my breast.
LINE 56: November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the
LINE 57: New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;
LINE 58: presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From
LINE 59: every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety
LINE 60: consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,
LINE 61: and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin
LINE 62: frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and
LINE 63: afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played
LINE 64: below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the
LINE 65: jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken
LINE 66: hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When
LINE 67: tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the
LINE 68: solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not
LINE 69: miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,
LINE 70: for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been
LINE 71: kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the
LINE 72: evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable
LINE 73: eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie,
LINE 74: as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off
LINE 75: to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally
LINE 76: bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee
LINE 77: till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that
LINE 78: nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers
LINE 79: sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings
LINE 80: as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.
LINE 81: To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,
LINE 82: and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to
LINE 83: find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby
LINE 84: as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what
LINE 85: absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive
LINE 86: and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my
LINE 87: night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively
LINE 88: happy, believing it to be happy likewise.
LINE 89: Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company,
LINE 90: and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes
LINE 91: she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors,
LINE 92: or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a
LINE 93: cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I
LINE 94: had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed
LINE 95: me, and said, "Good night, Miss Jane." When thus gentle, Bessie seemed
LINE 96: to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished
LINE 97: most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and
LINE 98: never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too
LINE 99: often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good
LINE 100: natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a
LINE 101: remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the
LINE 102: impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my
LINE 103: recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a
LINE 104: slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and
LINE 105: good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and
LINE 106: indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I
LINE 107: preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.
LINE 108: It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning:
LINE 109: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned
LINE 110: to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to
LINE 111: go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not
LINE 112: less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the
LINE 113: money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked
LINE 114: propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and
LINE 115: chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about
LINE 116: flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having
LINE 117: orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her
LINE 118: parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her
LINE 119: head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money,
LINE 120: she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old
LINE 121: curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the
LINE 122: housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure,
LINE 123: consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of
LINE 124: interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every
LINE 125: quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.
LINE 126: Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and
LINE 127: interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of
LINE 128: which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my
LINE 129: bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged
LINE 130: before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of
LINE 131: under-nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having
LINE 132: spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat
LINE 133: to put in order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered
LINE 134: there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone
LINE 135: (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her
LINE 136: property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other
LINE 137: occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the
LINE 138: window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through
LINE 139: which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and
LINE 140: petrified under the influence of a hard frost.
LINE 141: From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,
LINE 142: and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling
LINE 143: the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a
LINE 144: carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with
LINE 145: indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought
LINE 146: visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house,
LINE 147: the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being
LINE 148: nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in
LINE 149: the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the
LINE 150: twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the
LINE 151: casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the
LINE 152: table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash
LINE 153: to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running
LINE 154: upstairs into the nursery.
LINE 155: "Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you
LINE 156: washed your hands and face this morning?" I gave another tug before I
LINE 157: answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash
LINE 158: yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the
LINE 159: cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—
LINE 160: "No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting."
LINE 161: "Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look
LINE 162: quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you
LINE 163: opening the window for?"
LINE 164: I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a
LINE 165: hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand,
LINE 166: inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands
LINE 167: with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a
LINE 168: bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the
LINE 169: top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the
LINE 170: breakfast-room.
LINE 171: I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed
LINE 172: was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door
LINE 173: upon me. I slowly descended. For nearly three months, I had never been
LINE 174: called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the
LINE 175: breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions,
LINE 176: on which it dismayed me to intrude.
LINE 177: I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door,
LINE 178: and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little
LINE 179: poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those
LINE 180: days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to
LINE 181: the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement
LINE 182: ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.
LINE 183: "Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the
LINE 184: stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.
LINE 185: "What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a
LINE 186: woman?" The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and
LINE 187: curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared
LINE 188: to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing
LINE 189: erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,
LINE 190: placed above the shaft by way of capital.
LINE 191: Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to
LINE 192: me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger
LINE 193: with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to
LINE 194: you."
LINE 195: _He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood,
LINE 196: and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which
LINE 197: twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass
LINE 198: voice, "Her size is small: what is her age?"
LINE 199: "Ten years."
LINE 200: "So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for
LINE 201: some minutes. Presently he addressed me—"Your name, little girl?"
LINE 202: "Jane Eyre, sir."
LINE 203: In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;
LINE 204: but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all
LINE 205: the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.
LINE 206: "Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"
LINE 207: Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a
LINE 208: contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an
LINE 209: expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on
LINE 210: that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."
LINE 211: "Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending
LINE 212: from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair
LINE 213: opposite Mrs. Reed's. "Come here," he said.
LINE 214: I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him.
LINE 215: What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a
LINE 216: great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!
LINE 217: "No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a
LINE 218: naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?"
LINE 219: "They go to hell," was my ready and orthodox answer.
LINE 220: "And what is hell? Can you tell me that?"
LINE 221: "A pit full of fire."
LINE 222: "And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for
LINE 223: ever?"
LINE 224: "No, sir."
LINE 225: "What must you do to avoid it?"
LINE 226: I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable:
LINE 227: "I must keep in good health, and not die."
LINE 228: "How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily.
LINE 229: I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a
LINE 230: good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the
LINE 231: same could not be said of you were you to be called hence."
LINE 232: Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down
LINE 233: on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself
LINE 234: far enough away.
LINE 235: "I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having
LINE 236: been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress."
LINE 237: "Benefactress! benefactress!" said I inwardly: "they all call Mrs. Reed
LINE 238: my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing."
LINE 239: "Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
LINE 240: "Yes, sir."
LINE 241: "Do you read your Bible?"
LINE 242: "Sometimes."
LINE 243: "With pleasure? Are you fond of it?"
LINE 244: "I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel,
LINE 245: and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and
LINE 246: Job and Jonah."
LINE 247: "And the Psalms? I hope you like them?"
LINE 248: "No, sir."
LINE 249: "No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six
LINE 250: Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a
LINE 251: gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh!
LINE 252: the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a
LINE 253: little angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his
LINE 254: infant piety."
LINE 255: "Psalms are not interesting," I remarked.
LINE 256: "That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to
LINE 257: change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of
LINE 258: stone and give you a heart of flesh."
LINE 259: I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that
LINE 260: operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed
LINE 261: interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the
LINE 262: conversation herself.
LINE 263: "Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to
LINE 264: you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character
LINE 265: and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school,
LINE 266: I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to
LINE 267: keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst
LINE 268: fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that
LINE 269: you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst."
LINE 270: Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her
LINE 271: nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however
LINE 272: carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my
LINE 273: efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.
LINE 274: Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I
LINE 275: dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new
LINE 276: phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I
LINE 277: could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and
LINE 278: unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.
LINE 279: Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do
LINE 280: to remedy the injury?
LINE 281: "Nothing, indeed," thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and
LINE 282: hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
LINE 283: "Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child," said Mr. Brocklehurst; "it
LINE 284: is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake
LINE 285: burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.
LINE 286: Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers."
LINE 287: "I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,"
LINE 288: continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as
LINE 289: for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at
LINE 290: Lowood."
LINE 291: "Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam," returned Mr.
LINE 292: Brocklehurst. "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly
LINE 293: appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial
LINE 294: care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied
LINE 295: how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only
LINE 296: the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second
LINE 297: daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her
LINE 298: return she exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls
LINE 299: at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their
LINE 300: long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their
LINE 301: frocks—they are almost like poor people's children! and,' said she,
LINE 302: 'they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk
LINE 303: gown before.'"
LINE 304: "This is the state of things I quite approve," returned Mrs. Reed; "had
LINE 305: I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more
LINE 306: exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr.
LINE 307: Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things."
LINE 308: "Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been
LINE 309: observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of
LINE 310: Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,
LINE 311: hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and
LINE 312: its inhabitants."
LINE 313: "Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as
LINE 314: a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her
LINE 315: position and prospects?"
LINE 316: "Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,
LINE 317: and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable
LINE 318: privilege of her election."
LINE 319: "I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I
LINE 320: assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was
LINE 321: becoming too irksome."
LINE 322: "No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall
LINE 323: return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good
LINE 324: friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall
LINE 325: send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there
LINE 326: will be no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye."
LINE 327: "Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst,
LINE 328: and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst."
LINE 329: "I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's
LINE 330: Guide'; read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An
LINE 331: account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G——, a naughty child
LINE 332: addicted to falsehood and deceit.'"
LINE 333: With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn
LINE 334: in a cover, and having rung for his carriage, he departed.
LINE 335: Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she
LINE 336: was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some
LINE 337: six or seven and thirty; she was a woman of robust frame,
LINE 338: square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not
LINE 339: obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much
LINE 340: developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and
LINE 341: prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light
LINE 342: eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque,
LINE 343: her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness
LINE 344: never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household
LINE 345: and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at
LINE 346: times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well,
LINE 347: and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.
LINE 348: Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her
LINE 349: figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing
LINE 350: the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been
LINE 351: pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs.
LINE 352: Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of
LINE 353: their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had
LINE 354: felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of
LINE 355: resentment fomented now within me.
LINE 356: Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers
LINE 357: at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
LINE 358: "Go out of the room; return to the nursery," was her mandate. My look
LINE 359: or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with
LINE 360: extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I
LINE 361: came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up
LINE 362: to her.
LINE 363: _Speak_ I must: I had been trodden on severely, and _must_ turn: but
LINE 364: how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist? I
LINE 365: gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—
LINE 366: "I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved _you;_ but I
LINE 367: declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the
LINE 368: world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to
LINE 369: your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I."
LINE 370: Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice
LINE 371: continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
LINE 372: "What more have you to say?" she asked, rather in the tone in which a
LINE 373: person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is
LINE 374: ordinarily used to a child.
LINE 375: That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking
LINE 376: from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—
LINE 377: "I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt
LINE 378: again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown
LINE 379: up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I
LINE 380: will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me
LINE 381: with miserable cruelty."
LINE 382: "How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?"
LINE 383: "How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the _truth_. You
LINE 384: think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or
LINE 385: kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember
LINE 386: how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the
LINE 387: red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in
LINE 388: agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have
LINE 389: mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!' And that punishment you made me suffer
LINE 390: because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will
LINE 391: tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a
LINE 392: good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted. _You_ are deceitful!"
LINE 393: How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth
LINE 394: Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with
LINE 395: the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as
LINE 396: if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into
LINE 397: unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed
LINE 398: looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting
LINE 399: up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as
LINE 400: if she would cry.
LINE 401: "Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you
LINE 402: tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?"
LINE 403: "No, Mrs. Reed."
LINE 404: "Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to
LINE 405: be your friend."
LINE 406: "Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful
LINE 407: disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and
LINE 408: what you have done."
LINE 409: "Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected
LINE 410: for their faults."
LINE 411: "Deceit is not my fault!" I cried out in a savage, high voice.
LINE 412: "But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to
LINE 413: the nursery—there's a dear—and lie down a little."
LINE 414: "I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.
LINE 415: Reed, for I hate to live here."
LINE 416: "I will indeed send her to school soon," murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto
LINE 417: voce_; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.
LINE 418: I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I
LINE 419: had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the
LINE 420: rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's
LINE 421: solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce
LINE 422: pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my
LINE 423: pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot
LINE 424: give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,
LINE 425: without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of
LINE 426: reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would
LINE 427: have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs.
LINE 428: Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead,
LINE 429: would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when
LINE 430: half-an-hour's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my
LINE 431: conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.
LINE 432: Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic
LINE 433: wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,
LINE 434: metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.
LINE 435: Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I
LINE 436: knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way
LINE 437: to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every
LINE 438: turbulent impulse of my nature.
LINE 439: I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;
LINE 440: fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of
LINE 441: sombre indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and
LINE 442: endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own
LINE 443: thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found
LINE 444: fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the
LINE 445: shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or
LINE 446: breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt
LINE 447: of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was
LINE 448: quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the
LINE 449: falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept
LINE 450: by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a
LINE 451: gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where
LINE 452: the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most
LINE 453: opaque sky, "onding on snaw," canopied all; thence flakes fell at
LINE 454: intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without
LINE 455: melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over
LINE 456: and over again, "What shall I do?—what shall I do?"
LINE 457: All at once I heard a clear voice call, "Miss Jane! where are you? Come
LINE 458: to lunch!"
LINE 459: It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step
LINE 460: came tripping down the path.
LINE 461: "You naughty little thing!" she said. "Why don't you come when you are
LINE 462: called?"
LINE 463: Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been
LINE 464: brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat
LINE 465: cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,
LINE 466: I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger;
LINE 467: and I _was_ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just
LINE 468: put my two arms round her and said, "Come, Bessie! don't scold."
LINE 469: The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to
LINE 470: indulge in: somehow it pleased her.
LINE 471: "You are a strange child, Miss Jane," she said, as she looked down at
LINE 472: me; "a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I
LINE 473: suppose?"
LINE 474: I nodded.
LINE 475: "And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?"
LINE 476: "What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me."
LINE 477: "Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should
LINE 478: be bolder."
LINE 479: "What! to get more knocks?"
LINE 480: "Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that's certain. My mother said,
LINE 481: when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one
LINE 482: of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I've some good news
LINE 483: for you."
LINE 484: "I don't think you have, Bessie."
LINE 485: "Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but
LINE 486: Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this
LINE 487: afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I'll ask cook to bake you a
LINE 488: little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for
LINE 489: I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in
LINE 490: a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with
LINE 491: you."
LINE 492: "Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go."
LINE 493: "Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid
LINE 494: of me. Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so
LINE 495: provoking."
LINE 496: "I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I
LINE 497: have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to
LINE 498: dread."
LINE 499: "If you dread them they'll dislike you."
LINE 500: "As you do, Bessie?"
LINE 501: "I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all
LINE 502: the others."
LINE 503: "You don't show it."
LINE 504: "You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking. What
LINE 505: makes you so venturesome and hardy?"
LINE 506: "Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides"—I was going to say
LINE 507: something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second
LINE 508: thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
LINE 509: "And so you're glad to leave me?"
LINE 510: "Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry."
LINE 511: "Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I dare say
LINE 512: now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say
LINE 513: you'd _rather_ not."
LINE 514: "I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down." Bessie stooped; we
LINE 515: mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.
LINE 516: That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie
LINE 517: told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her
LINE 518: sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.
