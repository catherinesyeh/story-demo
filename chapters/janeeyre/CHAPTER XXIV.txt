LINE 1: As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered
LINE 2: if it were a dream. I could not be certain of the reality till I had
LINE 3: seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and
LINE 4: promise.
LINE 5: While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it
LINE 6: was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its
LINE 7: colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition,
LINE 8: and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple. I had often been unwilling
LINE 9: to look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my
LINE 10: look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his
LINE 11: affection by its expression. I took a plain but clean and light summer
LINE 12: dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so
LINE 13: well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
LINE 14: I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a
LINE 15: brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and
LINE 16: to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and
LINE 17: fragrant breeze. Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. A
LINE 18: beggar-woman and her little boy—pale, ragged objects both—were coming
LINE 19: up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to
LINE 20: have in my purse—some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must
LINE 21: partake of my jubilee. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but
LINE 22: nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.
LINE 23: Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad
LINE 24: countenance, and saying gravely—"Miss Eyre, will you come to
LINE 25: breakfast?" During the meal she was quiet and cool: but I could not
LINE 26: undeceive her then. I must wait for my master to give explanations; and
LINE 27: so must she. I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met
LINE 28: Adèle leaving the schoolroom.
LINE 29: "Where are you going? It is time for lessons."
LINE 30: "Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery."
LINE 31: "Where is he?"
LINE 32: "In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and
LINE 33: there he stood.
LINE 34: "Come and bid me good-morning," said he. I gladly advanced; and it was
LINE 35: not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I
LINE 36: received, but an embrace and a kiss. It seemed natural: it seemed
LINE 37: genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him.
LINE 38: "Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly
LINE 39: pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf? Is this my
LINE 40: mustard-seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and
LINE 41: rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?" (I
LINE 42: had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him they
LINE 43: were new-dyed, I suppose.)
LINE 44: "It is Jane Eyre, sir."
LINE 45: "Soon to be Jane Rochester," he added: "in four weeks, Janet; not a day
LINE 46: more. Do you hear that?"
LINE 47: I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy. The
LINE 48: feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than
LINE 49: was consistent with joy—something that smote and stunned: it was, I
LINE 50: think, almost fear.
LINE 51: "You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?"
LINE 52: "Because you gave me a new name—Jane Rochester; and it seems so
LINE 53: strange."
LINE 54: "Yes, Mrs. Rochester," said he; "young Mrs. Rochester—Fairfax
LINE 55: Rochester's girl-bride."
LINE 56: "It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely. Human beings never
LINE 57: enjoy complete happiness in this world. I was not born for a different
LINE 58: destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me
LINE 59: is a fairy tale—a day-dream."
LINE 60: "Which I can and will realise. I shall begin to-day. This morning I
LINE 61: wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his
LINE 62: keeping,—heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield. In a day or two I hope
LINE 63: to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall
LINE 64: be yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her."
LINE 65: "Oh, sir!—never rain jewels! I don't like to hear them spoken of.
LINE 66: Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not
LINE 67: have them."
LINE 68: "I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet
LINE 69: on your forehead,—which it will become: for nature, at least, has
LINE 70: stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the
LINE 71: bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with
LINE 72: rings."
LINE 73: "No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and
LINE 74: in another strain. Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your
LINE 75: plain, Quakerish governess."
LINE 76: "You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my
LINE 77: heart,—delicate and aërial."
LINE 78: "Puny and insignificant, you mean. You are dreaming, sir,—or you are
LINE 79: sneering. For God's sake, don't be ironical!"
LINE 80: "I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too," he went on,
LINE 81: while I really became uneasy at the strain he had adopted, because I
LINE 82: felt he was either deluding himself or trying to delude me. "I will
LINE 83: attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair;
LINE 84: and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil."
LINE 85: "And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any
LINE 86: longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket—a jay in borrowed plumes. I
LINE 87: would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings,
LINE 88: as myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome,
LINE 89: sir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.
LINE 90: Don't flatter me."
LINE 91: He pursued his theme, however, without noticing my deprecation. "This
LINE 92: very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must
LINE 93: choose some dresses for yourself. I told you we shall be married in
LINE 94: four weeks. The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down
LINE 95: below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town. After a
LINE 96: brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun:
LINE 97: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is
LINE 98: famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the
LINE 99: life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison
LINE 100: with others."
LINE 101: "Shall I travel?—and with you, sir?"
LINE 102: "You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and
LINE 103: Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you:
LINE 104: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also. Ten
LINE 105: years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and
LINE 106: rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with
LINE 107: a very angel as my comforter."
LINE 108: I laughed at him as he said this. "I am not an angel," I asserted; "and
LINE 109: I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must
LINE 110: neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me—for you will not get
LINE 111: it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all
LINE 112: anticipate."
LINE 113: "What do you anticipate of me?"
LINE 114: "For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,—a very little
LINE 115: while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious;
LINE 116: and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you:
LINE 117: but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me
LINE 118: again,—_like_ me, I say, not _love_ me. I suppose your love will
LINE 119: effervesce in six months, or less. I have observed in books written by
LINE 120: men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's ardour
LINE 121: extends. Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to
LINE 122: become quite distasteful to my dear master."
LINE 123: "Distasteful! and like you again! I think I shall like you again, and
LINE 124: yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_
LINE 125: you—with truth, fervour, constancy."
LINE 126: "Yet are you not capricious, sir?"
LINE 127: "To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I
LINE 128: find out they have neither souls nor hearts—when they open to me a
LINE 129: perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility,
LINE 130: coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue,
LINE 131: to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not
LINE 132: break—at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent—I am ever
LINE 133: tender and true."
LINE 134: "Had you ever experience of such a character, sir? Did you ever love
LINE 135: such an one?"
LINE 136: "I love it now."
LINE 137: "But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult
LINE 138: standard?"
LINE 139: "I never met your likeness. Jane, you please me, and you master me—you
LINE 140: seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I
LINE 141: am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up
LINE 142: my arm to my heart. I am influenced—conquered; and the influence is
LINE 143: sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery
LINE 144: beyond any triumph I can win. Why do you smile, Jane? What does that
LINE 145: inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?"
LINE 146: "I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I
LINE 147: was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers—"
LINE 148: "You were, you little elfish—"
LINE 149: "Hush, sir! You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those
LINE 150: gentlemen acted very wisely. However, had they been married, they would
LINE 151: no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness
LINE 152: as suitors; and so will you, I fear. I wonder how you will answer me a
LINE 153: year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or
LINE 154: pleasure to grant."
LINE 155: "Ask me something now, Janet,—the least thing: I desire to be
LINE 156: entreated—"
LINE 157: "Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready."
LINE 158: "Speak! But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall
LINE 159: swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of
LINE 160: me."
LINE 161: "Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't
LINE 162: crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round
LINE 163: that plain pocket handkerchief you have there."
LINE 164: "I might as well 'gild refined gold.' I know it: your request is
LINE 165: granted then—for the time. I will remand the order I despatched to my
LINE 166: banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift
LINE 167: to be withdrawn: try again."
LINE 168: "Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is
LINE 169: much piqued on one point."
LINE 170: He looked disturbed. "What? what?" he said hastily. "Curiosity is a
LINE 171: dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every
LINE 172: request—"
LINE 173: "But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir."
LINE 174: "Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into,
LINE 175: perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate."
LINE 176: "Now, King Ahasuerus! What do I want with half your estate? Do you
LINE 177: think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land? I would much
LINE 178: rather have all your confidence. You will not exclude me from your
LINE 179: confidence if you admit me to your heart?"
LINE 180: "You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but
LINE 181: for God's sake, don't desire a useless burden! Don't long for
LINE 182: poison—don't turn out a downright Eve on my hands!"
LINE 183: "Why not, sir? You have just been telling me how much you liked to be
LINE 184: conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you. Don't you think
LINE 185: I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and
LINE 186: entreat—even cry and be sulky if necessary—for the sake of a mere essay
LINE 187: of my power?"
LINE 188: "I dare you to any such experiment. Encroach, presume, and the game is
LINE 189: up."
LINE 190: "Is it, sir? You soon give in. How stern you look now! Your eyebrows
LINE 191: have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in
LINE 192: some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled
LINE 193: thunderloft.' That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?"
LINE 194: "If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give
LINE 195: up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander. But what
LINE 196: had you to ask, thing,—out with it?"
LINE 197: "There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal
LINE 198: better than flattery. I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel. This is
LINE 199: what I have to ask,—Why did you take such pains to make me believe you
LINE 200: wished to marry Miss Ingram?"
LINE 201: "Is that all? Thank God it is no worse!" And now he unknit his black
LINE 202: brows; looked down, smiling at me, and stroked my hair, as if well
LINE 203: pleased at seeing a danger averted. "I think I may confess," he
LINE 204: continued, "even although I should make you a little indignant,
LINE 205: Jane—and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are
LINE 206: indignant. You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you
LINE 207: mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal. Janet,
LINE 208: by-the-bye, it was you who made me the offer."
LINE 209: "Of course I did. But to the point if you please, sir—Miss Ingram?"
LINE 210: "Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render
LINE 211: you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy
LINE 212: would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that
LINE 213: end."
LINE 214: "Excellent! Now you are small—not one whit bigger than the end of my
LINE 215: little finger. It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act
LINE 216: in that way. Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?"
LINE 217: "Her feelings are concentrated in one—pride; and that needs humbling.
LINE 218: Were you jealous, Jane?"
LINE 219: "Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know
LINE 220: that. Answer me truly once more. Do you think Miss Ingram will not
LINE 221: suffer from your dishonest coquetry? Won't she feel forsaken and
LINE 222: deserted?"
LINE 223: "Impossible!—when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the
LINE 224: idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a
LINE 225: moment."
LINE 226: "You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester. I am afraid your
LINE 227: principles on some points are eccentric."
LINE 228: "My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little
LINE 229: awry for want of attention."
LINE 230: "Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been
LINE 231: vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the
LINE 232: bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?"
LINE 233: "That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the
LINE 234: world has the same pure love for me as yourself—for I lay that pleasant
LINE 235: unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection."
LINE 236: I turned my lips to the hand that lay on my shoulder. I loved him very
LINE 237: much—more than I could trust myself to say—more than words had power to
LINE 238: express.
LINE 239: "Ask something more," he said presently; "it is my delight to be
LINE 240: entreated, and to yield."
LINE 241: I was again ready with my request. "Communicate your intentions to Mrs.
LINE 242: Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was
LINE 243: shocked. Give her some explanation before I see her again. It pains me
LINE 244: to be misjudged by so good a woman."
LINE 245: "Go to your room, and put on your bonnet," he replied. "I mean you to
LINE 246: accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the
LINE 247: drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding. Did she think,
LINE 248: Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?"
LINE 249: "I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir."
LINE 250: "Station! station!—your station is in my heart, and on the necks of
LINE 251: those who would insult you, now or hereafter.—Go."
LINE 252: I was soon dressed; and when I heard Mr. Rochester quit Mrs. Fairfax's
LINE 253: parlour, I hurried down to it. The old lady had been reading her
LINE 254: morning portion of Scripture—the Lesson for the day; her Bible lay open
LINE 255: before her, and her spectacles were upon it. Her occupation, suspended
LINE 256: by Mr. Rochester's announcement, seemed now forgotten: her eyes, fixed
LINE 257: on the blank wall opposite, expressed the surprise of a quiet mind
LINE 258: stirred by unwonted tidings. Seeing me, she roused herself: she made a
LINE 259: sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but
LINE 260: the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put
LINE 261: up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the
LINE 262: table.
LINE 263: "I feel so astonished," she began, "I hardly know what to say to you,
LINE 264: Miss Eyre. I have surely not been dreaming, have I? Sometimes I half
LINE 265: fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never
LINE 266: happened. It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a
LINE 267: doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in
LINE 268: and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my
LINE 269: name, Alice, as he used to do. Now, can you tell me whether it is
LINE 270: actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don't
LINE 271: laugh at me. But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and
LINE 272: said that in a month you would be his wife."
LINE 273: "He has said the same thing to me," I replied.
LINE 274: "He has! Do you believe him? Have you accepted him?"
LINE 275: "Yes."
LINE 276: She looked at me bewildered.
LINE 277: "I could never have thought it. He is a proud man: all the Rochesters
LINE 278: were proud: and his father, at least, liked money. He, too, has always
LINE 279: been called careful. He means to marry you?"
LINE 280: "He tells me so."
LINE 281: She surveyed my whole person: in her eyes I read that they had there
LINE 282: found no charm powerful enough to solve the enigma.
LINE 283: "It passes me!" she continued; "but no doubt it is true since you say
LINE 284: so. How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know. Equality of
LINE 285: position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are
LINE 286: twenty years of difference in your ages. He might almost be your
LINE 287: father."
LINE 288: "No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like
LINE 289: my father! No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an
LINE 290: instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at
LINE 291: five-and-twenty."
LINE 292: "Is it really for love he is going to marry you?" she asked.
LINE 293: I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my
LINE 294: eyes.
LINE 295: "I am sorry to grieve you," pursued the widow; "but you are so young,
LINE 296: and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.
LINE 297: It is an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this
LINE 298: case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what
LINE 299: either you or I expect."
LINE 300: "Why?—am I a monster?" I said: "is it impossible that Mr. Rochester
LINE 301: should have a sincere affection for me?"
LINE 302: "No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I
LINE 303: daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of
LINE 304: pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little
LINE 305: uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your
LINE 306: guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I
LINE 307: knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so
LINE 308: discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be
LINE 309: trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I
LINE 310: suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,
LINE 311: nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in
LINE 312: with him."
LINE 313: "Well, never mind that now," I interrupted impatiently; "it is enough
LINE 314: that all was right."
LINE 315: "I hope all will be right in the end," she said: "but believe me, you
LINE 316: cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:
LINE 317: distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not
LINE 318: accustomed to marry their governesses."
LINE 319: I was growing truly irritated: happily, Adèle ran in.
LINE 320: "Let me go,—let me go to Millcote too!" she cried. "Mr. Rochester
LINE 321: won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let
LINE 322: me go, mademoiselle."
LINE 323: "That I will, Adèle;" and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my
LINE 324: gloomy monitress. The carriage was ready: they were bringing it round
LINE 325: to the front, and my master was pacing the pavement, Pilot following
LINE 326: him backwards and forwards.
LINE 327: "Adèle may accompany us, may she not, sir?"
LINE 328: "I told her no. I'll have no brats!—I'll have only you."
LINE 329: "Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better."
LINE 330: "Not it: she will be a restraint."
LINE 331: He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs.
LINE 332: Fairfax's warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something
LINE 333: of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the
LINE 334: sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without
LINE 335: further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked
LINE 336: at my face.
LINE 337: "What is the matter?" he asked; "all the sunshine is gone. Do you
LINE 338: really wish the bairn to go? Will it annoy you if she is left behind?"
LINE 339: "I would far rather she went, sir."
LINE 340: "Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried
LINE 341: he to Adèle.
LINE 342: She obeyed him with what speed she might.
LINE 343: "After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much," said
LINE 344: he, "when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and
LINE 345: company—for life."
LINE 346: Adèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her
LINE 347: gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a
LINE 348: corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where I sat;
LINE 349: so stern a neighbour was too restrictive: to him, in his present
LINE 350: fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any
LINE 351: information.
LINE 352: "Let her come to me," I entreated: "she will, perhaps, trouble you,
LINE 353: sir: there is plenty of room on this side."
LINE 354: He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. "I'll send her to
LINE 355: school yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
LINE 356: Adèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school "sans
LINE 357: mademoiselle?"
LINE 358: "Yes," he replied, "absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take
LINE 359: mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the
LINE 360: white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with
LINE 361: me there, and only me."
LINE 362: "She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her," observed Adèle.
LINE 363: "I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and
LINE 364: hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adèle."
LINE 365: "She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?"
LINE 366: "Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry
LINE 367: her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater."
LINE 368: "Oh, qu'elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will
LINE 369: wear out: how can she get new ones?"
LINE 370: Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. "Hem!" said he. "What would you
LINE 371: do, Adèle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a
LINE 372: pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty
LINE 373: enough scarf out of a rainbow."
LINE 374: "She is far better as she is," concluded Adèle, after musing some time:
LINE 375: "besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon. If I
LINE 376: were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you."
LINE 377: "She has consented: she has pledged her word."
LINE 378: "But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all
LINE 379: air; and neither you nor she can fly."
LINE 380: "Adèle, look at that field." We were now outside Thornfield gates, and
LINE 381: bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was
LINE 382: well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty
LINE 383: timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
LINE 384: "In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight
LINE 385: since—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard
LINE 386: meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me
LINE 387: on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began
LINE 388: to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had
LINE 389: for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight
LINE 390: was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped
LINE 391: two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of
LINE 392: gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at
LINE 393: my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I
LINE 394: read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to
LINE 395: this effect—
LINE 396: "It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to
LINE 397: make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely
LINE 398: place—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her
LINE 399: horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver
LINE 400: vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it,
LINE 401: as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
LINE 402: "'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify! Here is a talisman
LINE 403: will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.
LINE 404: 'Put it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am
LINE 405: yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own
LINE 406: heaven yonder.' She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my
LINE 407: breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to
LINE 408: change it to a ring again."
LINE 409: "But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don't care for the fairy:
LINE 410: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?"
LINE 411: "Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon
LINE 412: I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a
LINE 413: fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai
LINE 414: menteur," and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his
LINE 415: "contes de fée," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fées, et quand
LINE 416: même il y en avait:" she was sure they would never appear to him, nor
LINE 417: ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.
LINE 418: The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr.
LINE 419: Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was
LINE 420: ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged
LINE 421: leave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of
LINE 422: entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to
LINE 423: two: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I
LINE 424: watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of
LINE 425: the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in
LINE 426: a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and
LINE 427: a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his
LINE 428: choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I
LINE 429: persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and
LINE 430: pearl-grey silk. "It might pass for the present," he said; "but he
LINE 431: would yet see me glittering like a parterre."
LINE 432: Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a
LINE 433: jeweller's shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a
LINE 434: sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and
LINE 435: I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of
LINE 436: events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle,
LINE 437: John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his
LINE 438: legatee. "It would, indeed, be a relief," I thought, "if I had ever so
LINE 439: small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by
LINE 440: Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower
LINE 441: falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home,
LINE 442: and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had
LINE 443: but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of
LINE 444: fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now." And somewhat
LINE 445: relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I
LINE 446: ventured once more to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most
LINE 447: pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He
LINE 448: smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a
LINE 449: blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had
LINE 450: enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously,
LINE 451: and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.
LINE 452: "You need not look in that way," I said; "if you do, I'll wear nothing
LINE 453: but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I'll be married in
LINE 454: this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of
LINE 455: the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the
LINE 456: black satin."
LINE 457: He chuckled; he rubbed his hands. "Oh, it is rich to see and hear her!"
LINE 458: he exclaimed. "Is she original? Is she piquant? I would not exchange
LINE 459: this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio,
LINE 460: gazelle-eyes, houri forms, and all!"
LINE 461: The Eastern allusion bit me again. "I'll not stand you an inch in the
LINE 462: stead of a seraglio," I said; "so don't consider me an equivalent for
LINE 463: one. If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir,
LINE 464: to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive
LINE 465: slave-purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend
LINE 466: satisfactorily here."
LINE 467: "And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of
LINE 468: flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?"
LINE 469: "I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty
LINE 470: to them that are enslaved—your harem inmates amongst the rest. I'll get
LINE 471: admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw
LINE 472: as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our
LINE 473: hands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have
LINE 474: signed a charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred."
LINE 475: "I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane."
LINE 476: "I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with
LINE 477: an eye like that. While you looked so, I should be certain that
LINE 478: whatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when
LINE 479: released, would be to violate its conditions."
LINE 480: "Why, Jane, what would you have? I fear you will compel me to go
LINE 481: through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the
LINE 482: altar. You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms—what will they
LINE 483: be?"
LINE 484: "I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations. Do
LINE 485: you remember what you said of Céline Varens?—of the diamonds, the
LINE 486: cashmeres you gave her? I will not be your English Céline Varens. I
LINE 487: shall continue to act as Adèle's governess; by that I shall earn my
LINE 488: board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides. I'll furnish my
LINE 489: own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but—"
LINE 490: "Well, but what?"
LINE 491: "Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be
LINE 492: quit."
LINE 493: "Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't
LINE 494: your equal," said he. We were now approaching Thornfield. "Will it
LINE 495: please you to dine with me to-day?" he asked, as we re-entered the
LINE 496: gates.
LINE 497: "No, thank you, sir."
LINE 498: "And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire."
LINE 499: "I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should
LINE 500: now: till—"
LINE 501: "Till what? You delight in half-phrases."
LINE 502: "Till I can't help it."
LINE 503: "Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the
LINE 504: companion of my repast?"
LINE 505: "I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on
LINE 506: as usual for another month."
LINE 507: "You will give up your governessing slavery at once."
LINE 508: "Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not. I shall just go on with
LINE 509: it as usual. I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been
LINE 510: accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel
LINE 511: disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time."
LINE 512: "I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all
LINE 513: this, 'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adèle would say; and
LINE 514: unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box. But
LINE 515: listen—whisper. It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine
LINE 516: presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold,
LINE 517: I'll just—figuratively speaking—attach you to a chain like this"
LINE 518: (touching his watch-guard). "Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my
LINE 519: bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne."
LINE 520: He said this as he helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he
LINE 521: afterwards lifted out Adèle, I entered the house, and made good my
LINE 522: retreat upstairs.
LINE 523: He duly summoned me to his presence in the evening. I had prepared an
LINE 524: occupation for him; for I was determined not to spend the whole time in
LINE 525: a _tête-à-tête_ conversation. I remembered his fine voice; I knew he
LINE 526: liked to sing—good singers generally do. I was no vocalist myself, and,
LINE 527: in his fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in
LINE 528: listening when the performance was good. No sooner had twilight, that
LINE 529: hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the
LINE 530: lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love
LINE 531: of heaven, to give me a song. He said I was a capricious witch, and
LINE 532: that he would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was
LINE 533: like the present.
LINE 534: "Did I like his voice?" he asked.
LINE 535: "Very much." I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of
LINE 536: his; but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e'en soothe
LINE 537: and stimulate it.
LINE 538: "Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment."
LINE 539: "Very well, sir, I will try."
LINE 540: I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated "a
LINE 541: little bungler." Being pushed unceremoniously to one side—which was
LINE 542: precisely what I wished—he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany
LINE 543: himself: for he could play as well as sing. I hied me to the
LINE 544: window-recess. And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees
LINE 545: and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following
LINE 546: strain:—
LINE 547: "The truest love that ever heart
LINE 548: Felt at its kindled core,
LINE 549: Did through each vein, in quickened start,
LINE 550: The tide of being pour.
LINE 551: Her coming was my hope each day,
LINE 552: Her parting was my pain;
LINE 553: The chance that did her steps delay
LINE 554: Was ice in every vein.
LINE 555: I dreamed it would be nameless bliss,
LINE 556: As I loved, loved to be;
LINE 557: And to this object did I press
LINE 558: As blind as eagerly.
LINE 559: But wide as pathless was the space
LINE 560: That lay our lives between,
LINE 561: And dangerous as the foamy race
LINE 562: Of ocean-surges green.
LINE 563: And haunted as a robber-path
LINE 564: Through wilderness or wood;
LINE 565: For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath,
LINE 566: Between our spirits stood.
LINE 567: I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned;
LINE 568: I omens did defy:
LINE 569: Whatever menaced, harassed, warned,
LINE 570: I passed impetuous by.
LINE 571: On sped my rainbow, fast as light;
LINE 572: I flew as in a dream;
LINE 573: For glorious rose upon my sight
LINE 574: That child of Shower and Gleam.
LINE 575: Still bright on clouds of suffering dim
LINE 576: Shines that soft, solemn joy;
LINE 577: Nor care I now, how dense and grim
LINE 578: Disasters gather nigh.
LINE 579: I care not in this moment sweet,
LINE 580: Though all I have rushed o'er
LINE 581: Should come on pinion, strong and fleet,
LINE 582: Proclaiming vengeance sore:
LINE 583: Though haughty Hate should strike me down,
LINE 584: Right, bar approach to me,
LINE 585: And grinding Might, with furious frown,
LINE 586: Swear endless enmity.
LINE 587: My love has placed her little hand
LINE 588: With noble faith in mine,
LINE 589: And vowed that wedlock's sacred band
LINE 590: Our nature shall entwine.
LINE 591: My love has sworn, with sealing kiss,
LINE 592: With me to live—to die;
LINE 593: I have at last my nameless bliss.
LINE 594: As I love—loved am I!"
LINE 595: He rose and came towards me, and I saw his face all kindled, and his
LINE 596: full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every
LINE 597: lineament. I quailed momentarily—then I rallied. Soft scene, daring
LINE 598: demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: a weapon
LINE 599: of defence must be prepared—I whetted my tongue: as he reached me, I
LINE 600: asked with asperity, "whom he was going to marry now?"
LINE 601: "That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane."
LINE 602: "Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had
LINE 603: talked of his future wife dying with him. What did he mean by such a
LINE 604: pagan idea? _I_ had no intention of dying with him—he might depend on
LINE 605: that."
LINE 606: "Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him!
LINE 607: Death was not for such as I."
LINE 608: "Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he
LINE 609: had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee."
LINE 610: "Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a
LINE 611: reconciling kiss?"
LINE 612: "No: I would rather be excused."
LINE 613: Here I heard myself apostrophised as a "hard little thing;" and it was
LINE 614: added, "any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing
LINE 615: such stanzas crooned in her praise."
LINE 616: I assured him I was naturally hard—very flinty, and that he would often
LINE 617: find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him divers
LINE 618: rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed: he
LINE 619: should know fully what sort of a bargain he had made, while there was
LINE 620: yet time to rescind it.
LINE 621: "Would I be quiet and talk rationally?"
LINE 622: "I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I
LINE 623: flattered myself I was doing that now."
LINE 624: He fretted, pished, and pshawed. "Very good," I thought; "you may fume
LINE 625: and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you,
LINE 626: I am certain. I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a
LINE 627: bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you
LINE 628: from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent
LINE 629: aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real
LINE 630: mutual advantage."
LINE 631: From less to more, I worked him up to considerable irritation; then,
LINE 632: after he had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I
LINE 633: got up, and saying, "I wish you good-night, sir," in my natural and
LINE 634: wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
LINE 635: The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of
LINE 636: probation; and with the best success. He was kept, to be sure, rather
LINE 637: cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he was excellently
LINE 638: entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove
LINE 639: sensibility, while fostering his despotism more, would have pleased his
LINE 640: judgment, satisfied his common-sense, and even suited his taste less.
LINE 641: In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet;
LINE 642: any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the
LINE 643: evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him. He continued to
LINE 644: send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I
LINE 645: appeared before him now, he had no such honeyed terms as "love" and
LINE 646: "darling" on his lips: the best words at my service were "provoking
LINE 647: puppet," "malicious elf," "sprite," "changeling," &c. For caresses,
LINE 648: too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the
LINE 649: arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear. It was all
LINE 650: right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to
LINE 651: anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her anxiety on
LINE 652: my account vanished; therefore I was certain I did well. Meantime, Mr.
LINE 653: Rochester affirmed I was wearing him to skin and bone, and threatened
LINE 654: awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming. I
LINE 655: laughed in my sleeve at his menaces. "I can keep you in reasonable
LINE 656: check now," I reflected; "and I don't doubt to be able to do it
LINE 657: hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised."
LINE 658: Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have
LINE 659: pleased than teased him. My future husband was becoming to me my whole
LINE 660: world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He stood
LINE 661: between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes
LINE 662: between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for
LINE 663: His creature: of whom I had made an idol.
