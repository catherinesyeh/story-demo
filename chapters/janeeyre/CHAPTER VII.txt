LINE 1: My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age
LINE 2: either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in
LINE 3: habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure
LINE 4: in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my
LINE 5: lot; though these were no trifles.
LINE 6: During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after
LINE 7: their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring
LINE 8: beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these
LINE 9: limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing
LINE 10: was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots,
LINE 11: the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became
LINE 12: numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well
LINE 13: the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening,
LINE 14: when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,
LINE 15: and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of
LINE 16: food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we
LINE 17: had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this
LINE 18: deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on
LINE 19: the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an
LINE 20: opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their
LINE 21: portion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious
LINE 22: morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing
LINE 23: to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the
LINE 24: remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the
LINE 25: exigency of hunger.
LINE 26: Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two
LINE 27: miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out
LINE 28: cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became
LINE 29: almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance
LINE 30: of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in
LINE 31: our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.
LINE 32: At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and
LINE 33: hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy
LINE 34: summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
LINE 35: I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our
LINE 36: drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,
LINE 37: gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example,
LINE 38: to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, "like stalwart
LINE 39: soldiers." The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves
LINE 40: too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.
LINE 41: How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got
LINE 42: back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in
LINE 43: the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great
LINE 44: girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups,
LINE 45: wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.
LINE 46: A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of
LINE 47: bread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of
LINE 48: a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all
LINE 49: looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to
LINE 50: reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder
LINE 51: I was invariably obliged to part with.
LINE 52: The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church
LINE 53: Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew;
LINE 54: and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose
LINE 55: irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of
LINE 56: these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some
LINE 57: half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall
LINE 58: down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be
LINE 59: taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the
LINE 60: centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the
LINE 61: sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank
LINE 62: together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors' high
LINE 63: stools.
LINE 64: I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed
LINE 65: that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month
LINE 66: after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the
LINE 67: archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had
LINE 68: my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.
LINE 69: One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting
LINE 70: with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,
LINE 71: raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just
LINE 72: passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and
LINE 73: when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en
LINE 74: masse_, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain
LINE 75: whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the
LINE 76: schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,
LINE 77: stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from
LINE 78: the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of
LINE 79: architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in
LINE 80: a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.
LINE 81: I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I
LINE 82: remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my
LINE 83: disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise
LINE 84: Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been
LINE 85: dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily
LINE 86: for the "Coming Man," whose information respecting my past life and
LINE 87: conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.
LINE 88: He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did
LINE 89: not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her
LINE 90: eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb
LINE 91: turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as
LINE 92: I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of
LINE 93: what he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
LINE 94: "I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it
LINE 95: struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises,
LINE 96: and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I
LINE 97: forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have
LINE 98: some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give
LINE 99: out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are
LINE 100: apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma'am! I wish the woollen
LINE 101: stockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the
LINE 102: kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a
LINE 103: quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of
LINE 104: the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to
LINE 105: time."
LINE 106: He paused.
LINE 107: "Your directions shall be attended to, sir," said Miss Temple.
LINE 108: "And, ma'am," he continued, "the laundress tells me some of the girls
LINE 109: have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit
LINE 110: them to one."
LINE 111: "I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine
LINE 112: Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last
LINE 113: Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the
LINE 114: occasion."
LINE 115: Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
LINE 116: "Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance
LINE 117: occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find,
LINE 118: in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of
LINE 119: bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the
LINE 120: past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find
LINE 121: no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this innovation? and by
LINE 122: what authority?"
LINE 123: "I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir," replied Miss Temple:
LINE 124: "the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly
LINE 125: eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time."
LINE 126: "Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up
LINE 127: these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and
LINE 128: indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any
LINE 129: little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the
LINE 130: spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the
LINE 131: incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more
LINE 132: delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the
LINE 133: aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual
LINE 134: edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude
LINE 135: under the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would
LINE 136: not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the
LINE 137: opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians;
LINE 138: to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord
LINE 139: Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow
LINE 140: Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by
LINE 141: every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine
LINE 142: consolations, 'If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are
LINE 143: ye.' Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt
LINE 144: porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile
LINE 145: bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"
LINE 146: Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss
LINE 147: Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now
LINE 148: gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,
LINE 149: appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;
LINE 150: especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's
LINE 151: chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified
LINE 152: severity.
LINE 153: Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands
LINE 154: behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his
LINE 155: eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or
LINE 156: shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had
LINE 157: hitherto used—
LINE 158: "Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—_what_ is that girl with curled hair?
LINE 159: Red hair, ma'am, curled—curled all over?" And extending his cane he
LINE 160: pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.
LINE 161: "It is Julia Severn," replied Miss Temple, very quietly.
LINE 162: "Julia Severn, ma'am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why,
LINE 163: in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she
LINE 164: conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable
LINE 165: establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?"
LINE 166: "Julia's hair curls naturally," returned Miss Temple, still more
LINE 167: quietly.
LINE 168: "Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these
LINE 169: girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again
LINE 170: and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely,
LINE 171: modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off
LINE 172: entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far
LINE 173: too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round.
LINE 174: Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall."
LINE 175: Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away
LINE 176: the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however,
LINE 177: and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they
LINE 178: obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and
LINE 179: grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.
LINE 180: Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,
LINE 181: whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the
LINE 182: inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.
LINE 183: He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes,
LINE 184: then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—
LINE 185: "All those top-knots must be cut off."
LINE 186: Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
LINE 187: "Madam," he pursued, "I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of
LINE 188: this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the
LINE 189: flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and
LINE 190: sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the
LINE 191: young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which
LINE 192: vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think
LINE 193: of the time wasted, of—"
LINE 194: Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies,
LINE 195: now entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have
LINE 196: heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet,
LINE 197: silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and
LINE 198: seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich
LINE 199: plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a
LINE 200: profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was
LINE 201: enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a
LINE 202: false front of French curls.
LINE 203: These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and
LINE 204: the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of
LINE 205: the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend
LINE 206: relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room
LINE 207: upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned
LINE 208: the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to
LINE 209: address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with
LINE 210: the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had
LINE 211: no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and
LINE 212: enchanted my attention.
LINE 213: Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss
LINE 214: Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my
LINE 215: personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only
LINE 216: elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and
LINE 217: while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a
LINE 218: manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my
LINE 219: treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling
LINE 220: with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it
LINE 221: was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of
LINE 222: slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.
LINE 223: "A careless girl!" said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—"It is
LINE 224: the new pupil, I perceive." And before I could draw breath, "I must not
LINE 225: forget I have a word to say respecting her." Then aloud: how loud it
LINE 226: seemed to me! "Let the child who broke her slate come forward!"
LINE 227: Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two
LINE 228: great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me
LINE 229: towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his
LINE 230: very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—
LINE 231: "Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be
LINE 232: punished."
LINE 233: The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.
LINE 234: "Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite," thought I;
LINE 235: and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in
LINE 236: my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.
LINE 237: "Fetch that stool," said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one
LINE 238: from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
LINE 239: "Place the child upon it."
LINE 240: And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: I was in no condition to
LINE 241: note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the
LINE 242: height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he was within a yard of me, and
LINE 243: that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of
LINE 244: silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
LINE 245: Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.
LINE 246: "Ladies," said he, turning to his family, "Miss Temple, teachers, and
LINE 247: children, you all see this girl?"
LINE 248: Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses
LINE 249: against my scorched skin.
LINE 250: "You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form
LINE 251: of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given
LINE 252: to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.
LINE 253: Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent
LINE 254: in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case."
LINE 255: A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel
LINE 256: that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be
LINE 257: shirked, must be firmly sustained.
LINE 258: "My dear children," pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos,
LINE 259: "this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn
LINE 260: you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little
LINE 261: castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper
LINE 262: and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her
LINE 263: example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports,
LINE 264: and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you must watch her: keep
LINE 265: your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her
LINE 266: actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation
LINE 267: be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this
LINE 268: child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen
LINE 269: who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut—this girl
LINE 270: is—a liar!"
LINE 271: Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in
LINE 272: perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts
LINE 273: produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics,
LINE 274: while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger
LINE 275: ones whispered, "How shocking!"
LINE 276: Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.
LINE 277: "This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable
LINE 278: lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own
LINE 279: daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid
LINE 280: by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent
LINE 281: patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful
LINE 282: lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent
LINE 283: her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to
LINE 284: the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of
LINE 285: you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her."
LINE 286: With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button
LINE 287: of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to
LINE 288: Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the
LINE 289: room. Turning at the door, my judge said—
LINE 290: "Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak
LINE 291: to her during the remainder of the day."
LINE 292: There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the
LINE 293: shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now
LINE 294: exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations
LINE 295: were, no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my
LINE 296: breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in
LINE 297: passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What
LINE 298: an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new
LINE 299: feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave
LINE 300: or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising
LINE 301: hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen
LINE 302: Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was
LINE 303: chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and
LINE 304: smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and
LINE 305: I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it
LINE 306: lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like
LINE 307: a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen
LINE 308: Burns wore on her arm "the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had
LINE 309: heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on
LINE 310: the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such
LINE 311: is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the
LINE 312: clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those
LINE 313: minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.
