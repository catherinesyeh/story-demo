LINE 1: Sophie came at seven to dress me: she was very long indeed in
LINE 2: accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose,
LINE 3: impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come. She was just
LINE 4: fastening my veil (the plain square of blond after all) to my hair with
LINE 5: a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as soon as I could.
LINE 6: "Stop!" she cried in French. "Look at yourself in the mirror: you have
LINE 7: not taken one peep."
LINE 8: So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my
LINE 9: usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. "Jane!"
LINE 10: called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the
LINE 11: stairs by Mr. Rochester.
LINE 12: "Lingerer!" he said, "my brain is on fire with impatience, and you
LINE 13: tarry so long!"
LINE 14: He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over,
LINE 15: pronounced me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but
LINE 16: the desire of his eyes," and then telling me he would give me but ten
LINE 17: minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his lately
LINE 18: hired servants, a footman, answered it.
LINE 19: "Is John getting the carriage ready?"
LINE 20: "Yes, sir."
LINE 21: "Is the luggage brought down?"
LINE 22: "They are bringing it down, sir."
LINE 23: "Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk
LINE 24: are there: return and tell me."
LINE 25: The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the
LINE 26: footman soon returned.
LINE 27: "Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
LINE 28: "And the carriage?"
LINE 29: "The horses are harnessing."
LINE 30: "We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment
LINE 31: we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the
LINE 32: coachman in his seat."
LINE 33: "Yes, sir."
LINE 34: "Jane, are you ready?"
LINE 35: I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait
LINE 36: for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the
LINE 37: hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was
LINE 38: held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly
LINE 39: follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a
LINE 40: second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose. I wonder what other
LINE 41: bridegroom ever looked as he did—so bent up to a purpose, so grimly
LINE 42: resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such
LINE 43: flaming and flashing eyes.
LINE 44: I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I
LINE 45: gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both
LINE 46: seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. I wanted to see the
LINE 47: invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to fasten a
LINE 48: glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he
LINE 49: seemed breasting and resisting.
LINE 50: At the churchyard wicket he stopped: he discovered I was quite out of
LINE 51: breath. "Am I cruel in my love?" he said. "Delay an instant: lean on
LINE 52: me, Jane."
LINE 53: And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising
LINE 54: calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy
LINE 55: morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green
LINE 56: grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of
LINE 57: strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes
LINE 58: graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, because, as they
LINE 59: saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not
LINE 60: they were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the
LINE 61: ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly
LINE 62: looking at my face, from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily
LINE 63: fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold. When I
LINE 64: rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the
LINE 65: porch.
LINE 66: We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white
LINE 67: surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was still: two
LINE 68: shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct:
LINE 69: the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault
LINE 70: of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails
LINE 71: the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the
LINE 72: remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the
LINE 73: civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.
LINE 74: Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step
LINE 75: behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a
LINE 76: gentleman, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began.
LINE 77: The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then
LINE 78: the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly
LINE 79: towards Mr. Rochester, went on.
LINE 80: "I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day
LINE 81: of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that
LINE 82: if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined
LINE 83: together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured
LINE 84: that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth
LINE 85: allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony
LINE 86: lawful."
LINE 87: He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever
LINE 88: broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the
LINE 89: clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his
LINE 90: breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched
LINE 91: towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have
LINE 92: this woman for thy wedded wife?"—when a distinct and near voice said—
LINE 93: "The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."
LINE 94: The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did
LINE 95: the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled
LINE 96: under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or
LINE 97: eyes, he said, "Proceed."
LINE 98: Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low
LINE 99: intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said—
LINE 100: "I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been
LINE 101: asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood."
LINE 102: "The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind us. "I
LINE 103: am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to
LINE 104: this marriage exists."
LINE 105: Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid,
LINE 106: making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and
LINE 107: strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm,
LINE 108: massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful, and
LINE 109: yet wild beneath!
LINE 110: Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. "What is the nature of the impediment?" he
LINE 111: asked. "Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?"
LINE 112: "Hardly," was the answer. "I have called it insuperable, and I speak
LINE 113: advisedly."
LINE 114: The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,
LINE 115: uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—
LINE 116: "It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr.
LINE 117: Rochester has a wife now living."
LINE 118: My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated
LINE 119: to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt
LINE 120: frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I
LINE 121: looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was
LINE 122: colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed
LINE 123: nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking,
LINE 124: without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he
LINE 125: only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.
LINE 126: "Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.
LINE 127: "My name is Briggs, a solicitor of —— Street, London."
LINE 128: "And you would thrust on me a wife?"
LINE 129: "I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
LINE 130: recognises, if you do not."
LINE 131: "Favour me with an account of her—with her name, her parentage, her
LINE 132: place of abode."
LINE 133: "Certainly." Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read
LINE 134: out in a sort of official, nasal voice:—
LINE 135: "'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. —— (a date of
LINE 136: fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in
LINE 137: the county of ——, and of Ferndean Manor, in ——shire, England, was
LINE 138: married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,
LINE 139: merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at —— church, Spanish
LINE 140: Town, Jamaica. The record of the marriage will be found in the register
LINE 141: of that church—a copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard
LINE 142: Mason.'"
LINE 143: "That—if a genuine document—may prove I have been married, but it does
LINE 144: not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living."
LINE 145: "She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.
LINE 146: "How do you know?"
LINE 147: "I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will
LINE 148: scarcely controvert."
LINE 149: "Produce him—or go to hell."
LINE 150: "I will produce him first—he is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the
LINE 151: goodness to step forward."
LINE 152: Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth; he experienced, too,
LINE 153: a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the
LINE 154: spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second
LINE 155: stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a
LINE 156: pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder—yes, it was Mason
LINE 157: himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him. His eye, as I have
LINE 158: often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in
LINE 159: its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead
LINE 160: received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he
LINE 161: stirred, lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him
LINE 162: on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his
LINE 163: body—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!" Contempt
LINE 164: fell cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had
LINE 165: shrivelled it up: he only asked—"What have _you_ to say?"
LINE 166: An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.
LINE 167: "The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand,
LINE 168: what have _you_ to say?"
LINE 169: "Sir—sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in a
LINE 170: sacred place." Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are you
LINE 171: aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?"
LINE 172: "Courage," urged the lawyer,—"speak out."
LINE 173: "She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more articulate
LINE 174: tones: "I saw her there last April. I am her brother."
LINE 175: "At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman. "Impossible! I am an
LINE 176: old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.
LINE 177: Rochester at Thornfield Hall."
LINE 178: I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he muttered—
LINE 179: "No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under
LINE 180: that name." He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he
LINE 181: formed his resolve, and announced it—
LINE 182: "Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
LINE 183: Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the
LINE 184: clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day." The man
LINE 185: obeyed.
LINE 186: Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: "Bigamy is an ugly
LINE 187: word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred
LINE 188: me, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last. I am little better
LINE 189: than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,
LINE 190: deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless
LINE 191: fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this
LINE 192: lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman
LINE 193: to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs.
LINE 194: Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a
LINE 195: time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept
LINE 196: there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my
LINE 197: bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that
LINE 198: she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name;
LINE 199: sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs
LINE 200: and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer
LINE 201: up, Dick!—never fear me!—I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you.
LINE 202: Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs
LINE 203: through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman
LINE 204: and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they
LINE 205: were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child,
LINE 206: copied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise,
LINE 207: modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes!
LINE 208: Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you
LINE 209: no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come
LINE 210: up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and _my wife_! You
LINE 211: shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge
LINE 212: whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy
LINE 213: with something at least human. This girl," he continued, looking at me,
LINE 214: "knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all
LINE 215: was fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into
LINE 216: a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad,
LINE 217: and embruted partner! Come all of you—follow!"
LINE 218: Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came
LINE 219: after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
LINE 220: "Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester coolly; "it
LINE 221: will not be wanted to-day."
LINE 222: At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet
LINE 223: and greet us.
LINE 224: "To the right-about—every soul!" cried the master; "away with your
LINE 225: congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too
LINE 226: late!"
LINE 227: He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still
LINE 228: beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the
LINE 229: first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:
LINE 230: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us
LINE 231: to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
LINE 232: "You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and stabbed you
LINE 233: here."
LINE 234: He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,
LINE 235: too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded
LINE 236: by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a
LINE 237: chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in
LINE 238: a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure
LINE 239: ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being,
LINE 240: one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all
LINE 241: fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it
LINE 242: was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild
LINE 243: as a mane, hid its head and face.
LINE 244: "Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!" said Mr. Rochester. "How are you? and how is
LINE 245: your charge to-day?"
LINE 246: "We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the boiling
LINE 247: mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not 'rageous."
LINE 248: A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the
LINE 249: clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
LINE 250: "Ah! sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not stay."
LINE 251: "Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments."
LINE 252: "Take care then, sir!—for God's sake, take care!"
LINE 253: The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and
LINE 254: gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,—those
LINE 255: bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.
LINE 256: "Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: "she
LINE 257: has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard."
LINE 258: "One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in
LINE 259: mortal discretion to fathom her craft."
LINE 260: "We had better leave her," whispered Mason.
LINE 261: "Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.
LINE 262: "'Ware!" cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr.
LINE 263: Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his
LINE 264: throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She
LINE 265: was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent
LINE 266: besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she
LINE 267: almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her
LINE 268: with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only
LINE 269: wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and
LINE 270: he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he
LINE 271: bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest
LINE 272: yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the
LINE 273: spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
LINE 274: "That is _my wife_," said he. "Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am
LINE 275: ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure
LINE 276: hours! And _this_ is what I wished to have" (laying his hand on my
LINE 277: shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth
LINE 278: of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her
LINE 279: just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the
LINE 280: difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this
LINE 281: face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of
LINE 282: the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge
LINE 283: ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize."
LINE 284: We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some
LINE 285: further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he
LINE 286: descended the stair.
LINE 287: "You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be
LINE 288: glad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason
LINE 289: returns to Madeira."
LINE 290: "My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?"
LINE 291: "Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his
LINE 292: house for some years. When your uncle received your letter intimating
LINE 293: the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,
LINE 294: who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to
LINE 295: Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;
LINE 296: for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the
LINE 297: name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may
LINE 298: suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to
LINE 299: say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his
LINE 300: disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will
LINE 301: ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate
LINE 302: you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason
LINE 303: to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He
LINE 304: referred him to me for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful
LINE 305: I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally
LINE 306: certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would
LINE 307: advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had
LINE 308: better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of
LINE 309: Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.
LINE 310: "No, no—let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without waiting to
LINE 311: take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The
LINE 312: clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or
LINE 313: reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.
LINE 314: I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to
LINE 315: which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,
LINE 316: fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep,
LINE 317: not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off
LINE 318: the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn
LINE 319: yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt
LINE 320: weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on
LINE 321: them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen,
LINE 322: moved—followed up and down where I was led or dragged—watched event
LINE 323: rush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I
LINE 324: thought_.
LINE 325: The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene
LINE 326: with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;
LINE 327: there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no
LINE 328: defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken,
LINE 329: a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short
LINE 330: questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence
LINE 331: adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;
LINE 332: then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all
LINE 333: was over.
LINE 334: I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:
LINE 335: nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was
LINE 336: the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her
LINE 337: prospects?
LINE 338: Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was
LINE 339: a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were
LINE 340: desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December
LINE 341: storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed
LINE 342: the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes
LINE 343: which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with
LINE 344: untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and
LINE 345: fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and
LINE 346: white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead—struck
LINE 347: with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born
LINE 348: in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so
LINE 349: blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could
LINE 350: never revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my
LINE 351: master's—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a
LINE 352: suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it;
LINE 353: it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms—it could not derive warmth from
LINE 354: his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was
LINE 355: blighted—confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had
LINE 356: been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice
LINE 357: to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of
LINE 358: stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must
LINE 359: go: _that_ I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern;
LINE 360: but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real
LINE 361: affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful
LINE 362: passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even
LINE 363: to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind
LINE 364: had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!
LINE 365: My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round
LINE 366: me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.
LINE 367: Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down
LINE 368: in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in
LINE 369: remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to
LINE 370: flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only
LINE 371: still throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an
LINE 372: unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless
LINE 373: mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to
LINE 374: express them—
LINE 375: "Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help."
LINE 376: It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I
LINE 377: had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it
LINE 378: came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole
LINE 379: consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith
LINE 380: death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That
LINE 381: bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, "the waters came into my
LINE 382: soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;
LINE 383: the floods overflowed me."
