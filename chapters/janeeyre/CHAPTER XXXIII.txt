LINE 1: When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm
LINE 2: continued all night. The next day a keen wind brought fresh and
LINE 3: blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost
LINE 4: impassable. I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent
LINE 5: the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting
LINE 6: nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the
LINE 7: tempest, I lit a candle, took down "Marmion," and beginning—
LINE 8: "Day set on Norham's castled steep,
LINE 9: And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,
LINE 10: And Cheviot's mountains lone;
LINE 11: The massive towers, the donjon keep,
LINE 12: The flanking walls that round them sweep,
LINE 13: In yellow lustre shone"—
LINE 14: I soon forgot storm in music.
LINE 15: I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door. No; it was St.
LINE 16: John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen
LINE 17: hurricane—the howling darkness—and stood before me: the cloak that
LINE 18: covered his tall figure all white as a glacier. I was almost in
LINE 19: consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up
LINE 20: vale that night.
LINE 21: "Any ill news?" I demanded. "Has anything happened?"
LINE 22: "No. How very easily alarmed you are!" he answered, removing his cloak
LINE 23: and hanging it up against the door, towards which he again coolly
LINE 24: pushed the mat which his entrance had deranged. He stamped the snow
LINE 25: from his boots.
LINE 26: "I shall sully the purity of your floor," said he, "but you must excuse
LINE 27: me for once." Then he approached the fire. "I have had hard work to get
LINE 28: here, I assure you," he observed, as he warmed his hands over the
LINE 29: flame. "One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite
LINE 30: soft yet."
LINE 31: "But why are you come?" I could not forbear saying.
LINE 32: "Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask
LINE 33: it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my
LINE 34: mute books and empty rooms. Besides, since yesterday I have experienced
LINE 35: the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who
LINE 36: is impatient to hear the sequel."
LINE 37: He sat down. I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I
LINE 38: began to fear his wits were touched. If he were insane, however, his
LINE 39: was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that
LINE 40: handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it
LINE 41: did just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and
LINE 42: let the firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where
LINE 43: it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so
LINE 44: plainly graved. I waited, expecting he would say something I could at
LINE 45: least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his
LINE 46: lip: he was thinking. It struck me that his hand looked wasted like his
LINE 47: face. A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was
LINE 48: moved to say—
LINE 49: "I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that
LINE 50: you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own
LINE 51: health."
LINE 52: "Not at all," said he: "I care for myself when necessary. I am well
LINE 53: now. What do you see amiss in me?"
LINE 54: This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed
LINE 55: that my solicitude was, at least in his opinion, wholly superfluous. I
LINE 56: was silenced.
LINE 57: He still slowly moved his finger over his upper lip, and still his eye
LINE 58: dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say
LINE 59: something, I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the
LINE 60: door, which was behind him.
LINE 61: "No, no!" he responded shortly and somewhat testily.
LINE 62: "Well," I reflected, "if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you
LINE 63: alone now, and return to my book."
LINE 64: So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of "Marmion." He soon
LINE 65: stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out
LINE 66: a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in
LINE 67: silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation. It was vain
LINE 68: to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I,
LINE 69: in impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but
LINE 70: talk I would.
LINE 71: "Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?"
LINE 72: "Not since the letter I showed you a week ago."
LINE 73: "There has not been any change made about your own arrangements? You
LINE 74: will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?"
LINE 75: "I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me." Baffled so
LINE 76: far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school
LINE 77: and my scholars.
LINE 78: "Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this
LINE 79: morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry
LINE 80: Close—they would have come to-day but for the snow."
LINE 81: "Indeed!"
LINE 82: "Mr. Oliver pays for two."
LINE 83: "Does he?"
LINE 84: "He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas."
LINE 85: "I know."
LINE 86: "Was it your suggestion?"
LINE 87: "No."
LINE 88: "Whose, then?"
LINE 89: "His daughter's, I think."
LINE 90: "It is like her: she is so good-natured."
LINE 91: "Yes."
LINE 92: Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It
LINE 93: aroused him; he uncrossed his legs, sat erect, turned to me.
LINE 94: "Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire," he said.
LINE 95: Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
LINE 96: "Half-an-hour ago," he pursued, "I spoke of my impatience to hear the
LINE 97: sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better
LINE 98: managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a
LINE 99: listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story
LINE 100: will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often
LINE 101: regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips. For the
LINE 102: rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.
LINE 103: "Twenty years ago, a poor curate—never mind his name at this
LINE 104: moment—fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with
LINE 105: him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who
LINE 106: consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding. Before two
LINE 107: years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by
LINE 108: side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the
LINE 109: pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old
LINE 110: cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ——shire.) They left a
LINE 111: daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap—cold as
LINE 112: that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night. Charity carried
LINE 113: the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it
LINE 114: was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of
LINE 115: Gateshead. You start—did you hear a noise? I daresay it is only a rat
LINE 116: scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn
LINE 117: before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted
LINE 118: by rats.—To proceed. Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it
LINE 119: was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at
LINE 120: the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know—being no
LINE 121: other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself. It seems
LINE 122: her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a
LINE 123: teacher, like yourself—really it strikes me there are parallel points
LINE 124: in her history and yours—she left it to be a governess: there, again,
LINE 125: your fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a
LINE 126: certain Mr. Rochester."
LINE 127: "Mr. Rivers!" I interrupted.
LINE 128: "I can guess your feelings," he said, "but restrain them for a while: I
LINE 129: have nearly finished; hear me to the end. Of Mr. Rochester's character
LINE 130: I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable
LINE 131: marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered
LINE 132: he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic. What his subsequent conduct
LINE 133: and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event
LINE 134: transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was
LINE 135: discovered she was gone—no one could tell when, where, or how. She had
LINE 136: left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had
LINE 137: been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of
LINE 138: information could be gathered respecting her. Yet that she should be
LINE 139: found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been
LINE 140: put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr.
LINE 141: Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted. Is
LINE 142: it not an odd tale?"
LINE 143: "Just tell me this," said I, "and since you know so much, you surely
LINE 144: _can_ tell it me—what of Mr. Rochester? How and where is he? What is he
LINE 145: doing? Is he well?"
LINE 146: "I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never
LINE 147: mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have
LINE 148: adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess—the nature
LINE 149: of the event which requires her appearance."
LINE 150: "Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?"
LINE 151: "I suppose not."
LINE 152: "But they wrote to him?"
LINE 153: "Of course."
LINE 154: "And what did he say? Who has his letters?"
LINE 155: "Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from
LINE 156: Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
LINE 157: I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he
LINE 158: had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation
LINE 159: to some former haunt on the Continent. And what opiate for his severe
LINE 160: sufferings—what object for his strong passions—had he sought there? I
LINE 161: dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master—once almost my
LINE 162: husband—whom I had often called "my dear Edward!"
LINE 163: "He must have been a bad man," observed Mr. Rivers.
LINE 164: "You don't know him—don't pronounce an opinion upon him," I said, with
LINE 165: warmth.
LINE 166: "Very well," he answered quietly: "and indeed my head is otherwise
LINE 167: occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish. Since you won't ask
LINE 168: the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it
LINE 169: here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written
LINE 170: down, fairly committed to black and white."
LINE 171: And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought
LINE 172: through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of
LINE 173: paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of
LINE 174: ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the
LINE 175: portrait-cover. He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced
LINE 176: in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"—the work
LINE 177: doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
LINE 178: "Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:" he said, "the advertisements
LINE 179: demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.—I confess I had my
LINE 180: suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once
LINE 181: resolved into certainty. You own the name and renounce the _alias_?"
LINE 182: "Yes—yes; but where is Mr. Briggs? He perhaps knows more of Mr.
LINE 183: Rochester than you do."
LINE 184: "Briggs is in London. I should doubt his knowing anything at all about
LINE 185: Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested. Meantime,
LINE 186: you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why
LINE 187: Mr. Briggs sought after you—what he wanted with you."
LINE 188: "Well, what did he want?"
LINE 189: "Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that
LINE 190: he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich—merely
LINE 191: that—nothing more."
LINE 192: "I!—rich?"
LINE 193: "Yes, you, rich—quite an heiress."
LINE 194: Silence succeeded.
LINE 195: "You must prove your identity of course," resumed St. John presently:
LINE 196: "a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on
LINE 197: immediate possession. Your fortune is vested in the English funds;
LINE 198: Briggs has the will and the necessary documents."
LINE 199: Here was a new card turned up! It is a fine thing, reader, to be lifted
LINE 200: in a moment from indigence to wealth—a very fine thing; but not a
LINE 201: matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once. And then
LINE 202: there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving:
LINE 203: _this_ is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it:
LINE 204: all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are
LINE 205: the same. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing
LINE 206: one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to
LINE 207: ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave
LINE 208: cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn
LINE 209: brow.
LINE 210: Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words,
LINE 211: Death, Funeral. My uncle I had heard was dead—my only relative; ever
LINE 212: since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of
LINE 213: one day seeing him: now, I never should. And then this money came only
LINE 214: to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self. It
LINE 215: was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious—yes, I
LINE 216: felt that—_that_ thought swelled my heart.
LINE 217: "You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers. "I thought Medusa
LINE 218: had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you
LINE 219: will ask how much you are worth?"
LINE 220: "How much am I worth?"
LINE 221: "Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of—twenty thousand pounds, I
LINE 222: think they say—but what is that?"
LINE 223: "Twenty thousand pounds?"
LINE 224: Here was a new stunner—I had been calculating on four or five thousand.
LINE 225: This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I
LINE 226: had never heard laugh before, laughed now.
LINE 227: "Well," said he, "if you had committed a murder, and I had told you
LINE 228: your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast."
LINE 229: "It is a large sum—don't you think there is a mistake?"
LINE 230: "No mistake at all."
LINE 231: "Perhaps you have read the figures wrong—it may be two thousand!"
LINE 232: "It is written in letters, not figures,—twenty thousand."
LINE 233: I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical
LINE 234: powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions
LINE 235: for a hundred. Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
LINE 236: "If it were not such a very wild night," he said, "I would send Hannah
LINE 237: down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left
LINE 238: alone. But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as
LINE 239: I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your
LINE 240: sorrows. Good-night."
LINE 241: He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.
LINE 242: "Stop one minute!" I cried.
LINE 243: "Well?"
LINE 244: "It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he
LINE 245: knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way
LINE 246: place, had the power to aid in my discovery."
LINE 247: "Oh! I am a clergyman," he said; "and the clergy are often appealed to
LINE 248: about odd matters." Again the latch rattled.
LINE 249: "No; that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and indeed there was
LINE 250: something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of
LINE 251: allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
LINE 252: "It is a very strange piece of business," I added; "I must know more
LINE 253: about it."
LINE 254: "Another time."
LINE 255: "No; to-night!—to-night!" and as he turned from the door, I placed
LINE 256: myself between it and him. He looked rather embarrassed.
LINE 257: "You certainly shall not go till you have told me all," I said.
LINE 258: "I would rather not just now."
LINE 259: "You shall!—you must!"
LINE 260: "I would rather Diana or Mary informed you."
LINE 261: Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax: gratified
LINE 262: it must be, and that without delay; and I told him so.
LINE 263: "But I apprised you that I was a hard man," said he, "difficult to
LINE 264: persuade."
LINE 265: "And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off."
LINE 266: And I am a hard woman,—impossible to put off
LINE 267: "And then," he pursued, "I am cold: no fervour infects me."
LINE 268: "Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice. The blaze there has thawed
LINE 269: all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to
LINE 270: my floor, and made it like a trampled street. As you hope ever to be
LINE 271: forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a
LINE 272: sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know."
LINE 273: "Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your
LINE 274: perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping. Besides, you must
LINE 275: know some day,—as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?"
LINE 276: "Of course: that was all settled before."
LINE 277: "You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?—that I was
LINE 278: christened St. John Eyre Rivers?"
LINE 279: "No, indeed! I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your
LINE 280: initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I
LINE 281: never asked for what name it stood. But what then? Surely—"
LINE 282: I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,
LINE 283: the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a
LINE 284: second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit
LINE 285: themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been
LINE 286: lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every
LINE 287: ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the
LINE 288: matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot
LINE 289: expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must
LINE 290: repeat his explanation.
LINE 291: "My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who
LINE 292: married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq.,
LINE 293: merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira. Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's
LINE 294: solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death,
LINE 295: and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's
LINE 296: orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never
LINE 297: forgiven, between him and my father. He wrote again a few weeks since,
LINE 298: to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything
LINE 299: of her. A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to
LINE 300: find her out. You know the rest." Again he was going, but I set my back
LINE 301: against the door.
LINE 302: "Do let me speak," I said; "let me have one moment to draw breath and
LINE 303: reflect." I paused—he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed
LINE 304: enough. I resumed—
LINE 305: "Your mother was my father's sister?"
LINE 306: "Yes."
LINE 307: "My aunt, consequently?"
LINE 308: He bowed.
LINE 309: "My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his
LINE 310: sister's children, as I am his brother's child?"
LINE 311: "Undeniably."
LINE 312: "You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows
LINE 313: from the same source?"
LINE 314: "We are cousins; yes."
LINE 315: I surveyed him. It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud
LINE 316: of,—one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that,
LINE 317: when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with
LINE 318: genuine affection and admiration. The two girls, on whom, kneeling down
LINE 319: on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor
LINE 320: House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and
LINE 321: despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman
LINE 322: who had found me almost dying at his threshold was my blood relation.
LINE 323: Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!—wealth
LINE 324: to the heart!—a mine of pure, genial affections. This was a blessing,
LINE 325: bright, vivid, and exhilarating;—not like the ponderous gift of gold:
LINE 326: rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight. I now
LINE 327: clapped my hands in sudden joy—my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled.
LINE 328: "Oh, I am glad!—I am glad!" I exclaimed.
LINE 329: St. John smiled. "Did I not say you neglected essential points to
LINE 330: pursue trifles?" he asked. "You were serious when I told you you had
LINE 331: got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited."
LINE 332: "What _can_ you mean? It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters
LINE 333: and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three
LINE 334: relations,—or two, if you don't choose to be counted,—are born into my
LINE 335: world full-grown. I say again, I am glad!"
LINE 336: I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the
LINE 337: thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle
LINE 338: them:—thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere
LINE 339: long. I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending
LINE 340: stars,—every one lit me to a purpose or delight. Those who had saved my
LINE 341: life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
LINE 342: They were under a yoke,—I could free them: they were scattered,—I could
LINE 343: reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be
LINE 344: theirs too. Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally
LINE 345: would be five thousand each, justice—enough and to spare: justice would
LINE 346: be done,—mutual happiness secured. Now the wealth did not weigh on me:
LINE 347: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,—it was a legacy of life, hope,
LINE 348: enjoyment.
LINE 349: How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot
LINE 350: tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind
LINE 351: me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it. He also
LINE 352: advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness
LINE 353: and distraction, shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
LINE 354: "Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow," I said, "and tell them to come
LINE 355: home directly. Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with
LINE 356: a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well."
LINE 357: "Tell me where I can get you a glass of water," said St. John; "you
LINE 358: must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings."
LINE 359: "Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?
LINE 360: Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and
LINE 361: settle down like an ordinary mortal?"
LINE 362: "You wander: your head becomes confused. I have been too abrupt in
LINE 363: communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength."
LINE 364: "Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it
LINE 365: is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand."
LINE 366: "Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should
LINE 367: comprehend better."
LINE 368: "Explain! What is there to explain? You cannot fail to see that twenty
LINE 369: thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the
LINE 370: nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?
LINE 371: What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of
LINE 372: the fortune that has accrued to them."
LINE 373: "To you, you mean."
LINE 374: "I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any
LINE 375: other. I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly
LINE 376: ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.
LINE 377: I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and
LINE 378: Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary. It would
LINE 379: please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment
LINE 380: and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be
LINE 381: mine in justice, though it might in law. I abandon to you, then, what
LINE 382: is absolutely superfluous to me. Let there be no opposition, and no
LINE 383: discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the
LINE 384: point at once."
LINE 385: "This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such
LINE 386: a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid."
LINE 387: "Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice
LINE 388: of the case?"
LINE 389: "I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.
LINE 390: Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his
LINE 391: own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to
LINE 392: you. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear
LINE 393: conscience, consider it absolutely your own."
LINE 394: "With me," said I, "it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of
LINE 395: conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an
LINE 396: opportunity of doing so. Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a
LINE 397: year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught
LINE 398: a glimpse—that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning
LINE 399: to myself lifelong friends."
LINE 400: "You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it
LINE 401: is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a
LINE 402: notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the
LINE 403: place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would
LINE 404: open to you: you cannot—"
LINE 405: "And you," I interrupted, "cannot at all imagine the craving I have for
LINE 406: fraternal and sisterly love. I never had a home, I never had brothers
LINE 407: or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to
LINE 408: admit me and own me, are you?"
LINE 409: "Jane, I will be your brother—my sisters will be your sisters—without
LINE 410: stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights."
LINE 411: "Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes;
LINE 412: slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy—gorged with gold I never earned
LINE 413: and do not merit! You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation!
LINE 414: Close union! Intimate attachment!"
LINE 415: "But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness
LINE 416: may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may
LINE 417: marry."
LINE 418: "Nonsense, again! Marry! I don't want to marry, and never shall marry."
LINE 419: "That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of
LINE 420: the excitement under which you labour."
LINE 421: "It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my
LINE 422: inclinations to the bare thought of marriage. No one would take me for
LINE 423: love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money
LINE 424: speculation. And I do not want a stranger—unsympathising, alien,
LINE 425: different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full
LINE 426: fellow-feeling. Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the
LINE 427: words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them
LINE 428: sincerely."
LINE 429: "I think I can. I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know
LINE 430: on what my affection for them is grounded,—respect for their worth and
LINE 431: admiration of their talents. You too have principle and mind: your
LINE 432: tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always
LINE 433: agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time
LINE 434: found a salutary solace. I feel I can easily and naturally make room in
LINE 435: my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister."
LINE 436: "Thank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had better go; for
LINE 437: if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some
LINE 438: mistrustful scruple."
LINE 439: "And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?"
LINE 440: "No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute."
LINE 441: He smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he took leave.
LINE 442: I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments
LINE 443: I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished. My
LINE 444: task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved—as my
LINE 445: cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on
LINE 446: making a just division of the property—as they must in their own hearts
LINE 447: have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been
LINE 448: innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what
LINE 449: I wished to do—they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the
LINE 450: affair to arbitration. The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able
LINE 451: lawyer: both coincided in my opinion: I carried my point. The
LINE 452: instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I,
LINE 453: each became possessed of a competency.
