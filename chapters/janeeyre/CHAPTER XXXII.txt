LINE 1: I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and
LINE 2: faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time
LINE 3: elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and
LINE 4: their nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed
LINE 5: to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon
LINE 6: found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as amongst
LINE 7: the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference
LINE 8: rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,
LINE 9: and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping
LINE 10: rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves
LINE 11: obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few
LINE 12: examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of
LINE 13: excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These
LINE 14: soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons
LINE 15: neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly
LINE 16: manners. The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even
LINE 17: surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I
LINE 18: began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I
LINE 19: had amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown,
LINE 20: almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught
LINE 21: the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of
LINE 22: needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them—characters
LINE 23: desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed
LINE 24: many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then
LINE 25: (the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an
LINE 26: enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a
LINE 27: consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were
LINE 28: not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and
LINE 29: benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it
LINE 30: made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
LINE 31: I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out,
LINE 32: I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with
LINE 33: friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the
LINE 34: regard of working people, is like "sitting in sunshine, calm and
LINE 35: sweet;" serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this
LINE 36: period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than
LINE 37: sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of
LINE 38: this calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable
LINE 39: exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading
LINE 40: contentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams
LINE 41: many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the
LINE 42: stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure,
LINE 43: with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met
LINE 44: Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of
LINE 45: being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his
LINE 46: hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of passing a
LINE 47: lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and
LINE 48: fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then
LINE 49: I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the
LINE 50: still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the
LINE 51: burst of passion. By nine o'clock the next morning I was punctually
LINE 52: opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties
LINE 53: of the day.
LINE 54: Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the
LINE 55: school was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She would
LINE 56: canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery
LINE 57: servant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple
LINE 58: habit, with her Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above
LINE 59: the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can
LINE 60: scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic
LINE 61: building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.
LINE 62: She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving
LINE 63: his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the
LINE 64: visitress pierce the young pastor's heart. A sort of instinct seemed to
LINE 65: warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was
LINE 66: looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek
LINE 67: would glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to
LINE 68: relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became
LINE 69: expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or
LINE 70: darting glance could indicate.
LINE 71: Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could
LINE 72: not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she
LINE 73: went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly
LINE 74: in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say,
LINE 75: with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, "I
LINE 76: love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of success that
LINE 77: keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.
LINE 78: But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged
LINE 79: round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed."
LINE 80: And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud
LINE 81: would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily
LINE 82: from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so
LINE 83: heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the
LINE 84: world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he
LINE 85: would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of
LINE 86: her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not
LINE 87: bind all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet,
LINE 88: the priest—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would
LINE 89: not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the
LINE 90: peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,
LINE 91: despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.
LINE 92: Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I
LINE 93: had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:
LINE 94: she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly
LINE 95: selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely
LINE 96: spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,
LINE 97: when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),
LINE 98: but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;
LINE 99: ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she
LINE 100: was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex
LINE 101: like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly
LINE 102: impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for
LINE 103: instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I
LINE 104: liked my pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched
LINE 105: over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an
LINE 106: equally attractive adult acquaintance.
LINE 107: She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers,
LINE 108: only, certainly, she allowed, "not one-tenth so handsome, though I was
LINE 109: a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel." I was, however,
LINE 110: good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a _lusus naturæ_, she
LINE 111: affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous
LINE 112: history, if known, would make a delightful romance.
LINE 113: One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless
LINE 114: yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and
LINE 115: the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French
LINE 116: books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then
LINE 117: my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a
LINE 118: pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views
LINE 119: from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.
LINE 120: She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with
LINE 121: delight.
LINE 122: "Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a
LINE 123: love—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first
LINE 124: school in S——. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?"
LINE 125: "With pleasure," I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at
LINE 126: the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then
LINE 127: on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only
LINE 128: ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with
LINE 129: all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board,
LINE 130: and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring
LINE 131: it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit
LINE 132: another day.
LINE 133: She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself
LINE 134: accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and
LINE 135: grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright
LINE 136: flower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud
LINE 137: personage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of Rosamond's
LINE 138: portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of
LINE 139: it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at
LINE 140: Vale Hall.
LINE 141: I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant
LINE 142: evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and
LINE 143: pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he
LINE 144: entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong
LINE 145: terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he
LINE 146: only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,
LINE 147: and would soon quit it for one more suitable.
LINE 148: "Indeed," cried Rosamond, "she is clever enough to be a governess in a
LINE 149: high family, papa."
LINE 150: I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in
LINE 151: the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with
LINE 152: great respect. He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;
LINE 153: that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once
LINE 154: belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of
LINE 155: that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best. He
LINE 156: accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have
LINE 157: formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a
LINE 158: valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would throw no
LINE 159: obstacle in the way of Rosamond's union with St. John. Mr. Oliver
LINE 160: evidently regarded the young clergyman's good birth, old name, and
LINE 161: sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.
LINE 162: It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after
LINE 163: helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of
LINE 164: a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright—scoured
LINE 165: floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself
LINE 166: neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
LINE 167: The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got
LINE 168: my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier
LINE 169: occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature. The head was
LINE 170: finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery
LINE 171: to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft
LINE 172: curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the
LINE 173: lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these
LINE 174: nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting
LINE 175: St. John Rivers.
LINE 176: "I am come to see how you are spending your holiday," he said. "Not, I
LINE 177: hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel
LINE 178: lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up
LINE 179: wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace," and
LINE 180: he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine
LINE 181: productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those
LINE 182: days—the golden age of modern literature. Alas! the readers of our era
LINE 183: are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or
LINE 184: repine. I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon
LINE 185: gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their
LINE 186: existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.
LINE 187: Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph,
LINE 188: and feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius
LINE 189: banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the
LINE 190: thought. No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without
LINE 191: their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell—the hell
LINE 192: of your own meanness.
LINE 193: While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for
LINE 194: "Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing. His tall
LINE 195: figure sprang erect again with a start: he said nothing. I looked up at
LINE 196: him: he shunned my eye. I knew his thoughts well, and could read his
LINE 197: heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he: I had
LINE 198: then temporarily the advantage of him, and I conceived an inclination
LINE 199: to do him some good, if I could.
LINE 200: "With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself
LINE 201: too far: locks every feeling and pang within—expresses, confesses,
LINE 202: imparts nothing. I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about
LINE 203: this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make
LINE 204: him talk."
LINE 205: I said first, "Take a chair, Mr. Rivers." But he answered, as he always
LINE 206: did, that he could not stay. "Very well," I responded, mentally, "stand
LINE 207: if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude
LINE 208: is at least as bad for you as it is for me. I'll try if I cannot
LINE 209: discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in
LINE 210: that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of
LINE 211: sympathy."
LINE 212: "Is this portrait like?" I asked bluntly.
LINE 213: "Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely."
LINE 214: "You did, Mr. Rivers."
LINE 215: He almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he looked at me
LINE 216: astonished. "Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within. "I don't mean
LINE 217: to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to
LINE 218: considerable lengths." I continued, "You observed it closely and
LINE 219: distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again," and I
LINE 220: rose and placed it in his hand.
LINE 221: "A well-executed picture," he said; "very soft, clear colouring; very
LINE 222: graceful and correct drawing."
LINE 223: "Yes, yes; I know all that. But what of the resemblance? Who is it
LINE 224: like?"
LINE 225: Mastering some hesitation, he answered, "Miss Oliver, I presume."
LINE 226: "Of course. And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will
LINE 227: promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very
LINE 228: picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you. I
LINE 229: don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would
LINE 230: deem worthless."
LINE 231: He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer
LINE 232: he held it, the more he seemed to covet it. "It is like!" he murmured;
LINE 233: "the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.
LINE 234: It smiles!"
LINE 235: "Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?
LINE 236: Tell me that. When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India,
LINE 237: would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or
LINE 238: would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and
LINE 239: distress?"
LINE 240: He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute,
LINE 241: disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
LINE 242: "That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be
LINE 243: judicious or wise is another question."
LINE 244: Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him, and that
LINE 245: her father was not likely to oppose the match, I—less exalted in my
LINE 246: views than St. John—had been strongly disposed in my own heart to
LINE 247: advocate their union. It seemed to me that, should he become the
LINE 248: possessor of Mr. Oliver's large fortune, he might do as much good with
LINE 249: it as if he went and laid his genius out to wither, and his strength to
LINE 250: waste, under a tropical sun. With this persuasion I now answered—
LINE 251: "As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were
LINE 252: to take to yourself the original at once."
LINE 253: By this time he had sat down: he had laid the picture on the table
LINE 254: before him, and with his brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over
LINE 255: it. I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. I
LINE 256: saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he had deemed
LINE 257: unapproachable—to hear it thus freely handled—was beginning to be felt
LINE 258: by him as a new pleasure—an unhoped-for relief. Reserved people often
LINE 259: really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more
LINE 260: than the expansive. The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and
LINE 261: to "burst" with boldness and good-will into "the silent sea" of their
LINE 262: souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
LINE 263: "She likes you, I am sure," said I, as I stood behind his chair, "and
LINE 264: her father respects you. Moreover, she is a sweet girl—rather
LINE 265: thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself
LINE 266: and her. You ought to marry her."
LINE 267: "_Does_ she like me?" he asked.
LINE 268: "Certainly; better than she likes any one else. She talks of you
LINE 269: continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so
LINE 270: often."
LINE 271: "It is very pleasant to hear this," he said—"very: go on for another
LINE 272: quarter of an hour." And he actually took out his watch and laid it
LINE 273: upon the table to measure the time.
LINE 274: "But where is the use of going on," I asked, "when you are probably
LINE 275: preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to
LINE 276: fetter your heart?"
LINE 277: "Don't imagine such hard things. Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am
LINE 278: doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and
LINE 279: overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and
LINE 280: with such labour prepared—so assiduously sown with the seeds of good
LINE 281: intentions, of self-denying plans. And now it is deluged with a
LINE 282: nectarous flood—the young germs swamped—delicious poison cankering
LINE 283: them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at
LINE 284: Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with
LINE 285: her sweet voice—gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has
LINE 286: copied so well—smiling at me with these coral lips. She is mine—I am
LINE 287: hers—this present life and passing world suffice to me. Hush! say
LINE 288: nothing—my heart is full of delight—my senses are entranced—let the
LINE 289: time I marked pass in peace."
LINE 290: I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood
LINE 291: silent. Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid
LINE 292: the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
LINE 293: "Now," said he, "that little space was given to delirium and delusion.
LINE 294: I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck
LINE 295: voluntarily under her yoke of flowers; I tasted her cup. The pillow was
LINE 296: burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste:
LINE 297: her promises are hollow—her offers false: I see and know all this."
LINE 298: I gazed at him in wonder.
LINE 299: "It is strange," pursued he, "that while I love Rosamond Oliver so
LINE 300: wildly—with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object
LINE 301: of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating—I experience
LINE 302: at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make
LINE 303: me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should
LINE 304: discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months'
LINE 305: rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret. This I know."
LINE 306: "Strange indeed!" I could not help ejaculating.
LINE 307: "While something in me," he went on, "is acutely sensible to her
LINE 308: charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they
LINE 309: are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to—co-operate
LINE 310: in nothing I undertook. Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female
LINE 311: apostle? Rosamond a missionary's wife? No!"
LINE 312: "But you need not be a missionary. You might relinquish that scheme."
LINE 313: "Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on
LINE 314: earth for a mansion in heaven? My hopes of being numbered in the band
LINE 315: who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their
LINE 316: race—of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance—of substituting
LINE 317: peace for war—freedom for bondage—religion for superstition—the hope of
LINE 318: heaven for the fear of hell? Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than
LINE 319: the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to
LINE 320: live for."
LINE 321: After a considerable pause, I said—"And Miss Oliver? Are her
LINE 322: disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?"
LINE 323: "Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than
LINE 324: a month, my image will be effaced from her heart. She will forget me;
LINE 325: and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I
LINE 326: should do."
LINE 327: "You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict. You are
LINE 328: wasting away."
LINE 329: "No. If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet
LINE 330: unsettled—my departure, continually procrastinated. Only this morning,
LINE 331: I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been
LINE 332: so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to
LINE 333: come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six."
LINE 334: "You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the
LINE 335: schoolroom."
LINE 336: Again the surprised expression crossed his face. He had not imagined
LINE 337: that a woman would dare to speak so to a man. For me, I felt at home in
LINE 338: this sort of discourse. I could never rest in communication with
LINE 339: strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had
LINE 340: passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold
LINE 341: of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.
LINE 342: "You _are_ original," said he, "and not timid. There is something brave
LINE 343: in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to
LINE 344: assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. You think them
LINE 345: more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance
LINE 346: of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I
LINE 347: shake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness. I
LINE 348: know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the
LINE 349: convulsion of the soul. _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in
LINE 350: the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am—a cold hard man."
LINE 351: I smiled incredulously.
LINE 352: "You have taken my confidence by storm," he continued, "and now it is
LINE 353: much at your service. I am simply, in my original state—stripped of
LINE 354: that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human
LINE 355: deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all
LINE 356: the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling,
LINE 357: is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do
LINE 358: more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance,
LINE 359: industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve
LINE 360: great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with
LINE 361: interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly,
LINE 362: energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone
LINE 363: through, or what you still suffer."
LINE 364: "You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher," I said.
LINE 365: "No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I
LINE 366: believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet. I am not a
LINE 367: pagan, but a Christian philosopher—a follower of the sect of Jesus. As
LINE 368: His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines. I
LINE 369: advocate them: I am sworn to spread them. Won in youth to religion, she
LINE 370: has cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ,
LINE 371: natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree,
LINE 372: philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has
LINE 373: reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power
LINE 374: and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread
LINE 375: my Master's kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the
LINE 376: cross. So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials
LINE 377: to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not
LINE 378: eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated 'till this mortal shall put
LINE 379: on immortality.'"
LINE 380: Having said this, he took his hat, which lay on the table beside my
LINE 381: palette. Once more he looked at the portrait.
LINE 382: "She _is_ lovely," he murmured. "She is well named the Rose of the
LINE 383: World, indeed!"
LINE 384: "And may I not paint one like it for you?"
LINE 385: "_Cui bono_? No."
LINE 386: He drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was
LINE 387: accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from
LINE 388: being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was
LINE 389: impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took it
LINE 390: up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,
LINE 391: inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that
LINE 392: seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and
LINE 393: dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted,
LINE 394: as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
LINE 395: "What is the matter?" I asked.
LINE 396: "Nothing in the world," was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw
LINE 397: him dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin. It disappeared in
LINE 398: his glove; and, with one hasty nod and "good-afternoon," he vanished.
LINE 399: "Well!" I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, "that caps
LINE 400: the globe, however!"
LINE 401: I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few
LINE 402: dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil. I
LINE 403: pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and
LINE 404: being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon
LINE 405: forgot it.
