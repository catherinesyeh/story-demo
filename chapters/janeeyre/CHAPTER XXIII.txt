LINE 1: A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant
LINE 2: as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our
LINE 3: wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the
LINE 4: South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest
LINE 5: them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round
LINE 6: Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees
LINE 7: were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply
LINE 8: tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows
LINE 9: between.
LINE 10: On Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay
LINE 11: Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop
LINE 12: asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.
LINE 13: It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—"Day its fervid fires
LINE 14: had wasted," and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
LINE 15: Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of
LINE 16: clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and
LINE 17: furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and
LINE 18: wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own
LINE 19: charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary
LINE 20: star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the
LINE 21: horizon.
LINE 22: I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that
LINE 23: of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a
LINE 24: handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the
LINE 25: orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it
LINE 26: was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it
LINE 27: out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened
LINE 28: it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation
LINE 29: from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and
LINE 30: terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat,
LINE 31: led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such
LINE 32: honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as
LINE 33: if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and
LINE 34: fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by
LINE 35: the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step
LINE 36: is stayed—not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning
LINE 37: fragrance.
LINE 38: Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been
LINE 39: yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither
LINE 40: of shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester's cigar.
LINE 41: I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I
LINE 42: hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form
LINE 43: is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must
LINE 44: flee. I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr.
LINE 45: Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay
LINE 46: long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will
LINE 47: never see me.
LINE 48: But no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden
LINE 49: as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree
LINE 50: branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are
LINE 51: laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a
LINE 52: knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the
LINE 53: dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes humming by me; it alights
LINE 54: on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he sees it, and bends to examine
LINE 55: it.
LINE 56: "Now, he has his back towards me," thought I, "and he is occupied too;
LINE 57: perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed."
LINE 58: I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel
LINE 59: might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two
LINE 60: distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. "I
LINE 61: shall get by very well," I meditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown
LINE 62: long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly,
LINE 63: without turning—
LINE 64: "Jane, come and look at this fellow."
LINE 65: I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel? I
LINE 66: started at first, and then I approached him.
LINE 67: "Look at his wings," said he, "he reminds me rather of a West Indian
LINE 68: insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in
LINE 69: England; there! he is flown."
LINE 70: The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.
LINE 71: Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said—
LINE 72: "Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and
LINE 73: surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting
LINE 74: with moonrise."
LINE 75: It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt
LINE 76: enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing
LINE 77: an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile
LINE 78: word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful
LINE 79: embarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.
LINE 80: Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to
LINE 81: allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts
LINE 82: busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself
LINE 83: looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any
LINE 84: confusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to
LINE 85: lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.
LINE 86: "Jane," he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly
LINE 87: strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,
LINE 88: "Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?"
LINE 89: "Yes, sir."
LINE 90: "You must have become in some degree attached to the house,—you, who
LINE 91: have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of
LINE 92: Adhesiveness?"
LINE 93: "I am attached to it, indeed."
LINE 94: "And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired
LINE 95: a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even
LINE 96: for simple dame Fairfax?"
LINE 97: "Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both."
LINE 98: "And would be sorry to part with them?"
LINE 99: "Yes."
LINE 100: "Pity!" he said, and sighed and paused. "It is always the way of events
LINE 101: in this life," he continued presently: "no sooner have you got settled
LINE 102: in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and
LINE 103: move on, for the hour of repose is expired."
LINE 104: "Must I move on, sir?" I asked. "Must I leave Thornfield?"
LINE 105: "I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you
LINE 106: must."
LINE 107: This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
LINE 108: "Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes."
LINE 109: "It is come now—I must give it to-night."
LINE 110: "Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?"
LINE 111: "Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the
LINE 112: nail straight on the head."
LINE 113: "Soon, sir?"
LINE 114: "Very soon, my—that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first
LINE 115: time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to
LINE 116: put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the
LINE 117: holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short
LINE 118: (she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the point—one can't have
LINE 119: too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well,
LINE 120: as I was saying—listen to me, Jane! You're not turning your head to
LINE 121: look after more moths, are you? That was only a lady-clock, child,
LINE 122: 'flying away home.' I wish to remind you that it was you who first said
LINE 123: to me, with that discretion I respect in you—with that foresight,
LINE 124: prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent
LINE 125: position—that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adèle
LINE 126: had better trot forthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in
LINE 127: this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are
LINE 128: far away, Janet, I'll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom;
LINE 129: which is such that I have made it my law of action. Adèle must go to
LINE 130: school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation."
LINE 131: "Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—" I
LINE 132: was going to say, "I suppose I may stay here, till I find another
LINE 133: shelter to betake myself to:" but I stopped, feeling it would not do to
LINE 134: risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
LINE 135: "In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester;
LINE 136: "and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an
LINE 137: asylum for you."
LINE 138: "Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give—"
LINE 139: "Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does her
LINE 140: duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her
LINE 141: employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her;
LINE 142: indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a
LINE 143: place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the
LINE 144: five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
LINE 145: Ireland. You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people
LINE 146: there, they say."
LINE 147: "It is a long way off, sir."
LINE 148: "No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the
LINE 149: distance."
LINE 150: "Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—"
LINE 151: "From what, Jane?"
LINE 152: "From England and from Thornfield: and—"
LINE 153: "Well?"
LINE 154: "From _you_, sir."
LINE 155: I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free
LINE 156: will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I
LINE 157: avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck
LINE 158: cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,
LINE 159: destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side
LINE 160: I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth,
LINE 161: caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably
LINE 162: loved.
LINE 163: "It is a long way," I again said.
LINE 164: "It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,
LINE 165: Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain. I
LINE 166: never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the
LINE 167: country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?"
LINE 168: "Yes, sir."
LINE 169: "And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the
LINE 170: little time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we'll talk
LINE 171: over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the
LINE 172: stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the
LINE 173: chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit
LINE 174: there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit
LINE 175: there together." He seated me and himself.
LINE 176: "It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little
LINE 177: friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be
LINE 178: helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?"
LINE 179: I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
LINE 180: "Because," he said, "I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to
LINE 181: you—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string
LINE 182: somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a
LINE 183: similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little
LINE 184: frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of
LINE 185: land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be
LINE 186: snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding
LINE 187: inwardly. As for you,—you'd forget me."
LINE 188: "That I _never_ should, sir: you know—" Impossible to proceed.
LINE 189: "Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!"
LINE 190: In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured
LINE 191: no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot
LINE 192: with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an
LINE 193: impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
LINE 194: "Because you are sorry to leave it?"
LINE 195: The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was
LINE 196: claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right
LINE 197: to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—and
LINE 198: to speak.
LINE 199: "I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I
LINE 200: have lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least. I
LINE 201: have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been
LINE 202: buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of
LINE 203: communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked,
LINE 204: face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an
LINE 205: original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr.
LINE 206: Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I
LINE 207: absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of
LINE 208: departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death."
LINE 209: "Where do you see the necessity?" he asked suddenly.
LINE 210: "Where? You, sir, have placed it before me."
LINE 211: "In what shape?"
LINE 212: "In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride."
LINE 213: "My bride! What bride? I have no bride!"
LINE 214: "But you will have."
LINE 215: "Yes;—I will!—I will!" He set his teeth.
LINE 216: "Then I must go:—you have said it yourself."
LINE 217: "No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept."
LINE 218: "I tell you I must go!" I retorted, roused to something like passion.
LINE 219: "Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an
LINE 220: automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel
LINE 221: of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from
LINE 222: my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I
LINE 223: am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as
LINE 224: you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty
LINE 225: and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as
LINE 226: it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the
LINE 227: medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my
LINE 228: spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through
LINE 229: the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,—as we are!"
LINE 230: "As we are!" repeated Mr. Rochester—"so," he added, enclosing me in his
LINE 231: arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: "so,
LINE 232: Jane!"
LINE 233: "Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married
LINE 234: man—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you—to one
LINE 235: with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love;
LINE 236: for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would scorn such a union:
LINE 237: therefore I am better than you—let me go!"
LINE 238: "Where, Jane? To Ireland?"
LINE 239: "Yes—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now."
LINE 240: "Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is
LINE 241: rending its own plumage in its desperation."
LINE 242: "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an
LINE 243: independent will, which I now exert to leave you."
LINE 244: Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.
LINE 245: "And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my
LINE 246: hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions."
LINE 247: "You play a farce, which I merely laugh at."
LINE 248: "I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and
LINE 249: best earthly companion."
LINE 250: "For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by
LINE 251: it."
LINE 252: "Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still
LINE 253: too."
LINE 254: A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through
LINE 255: the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite
LINE 256: distance—it died. The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the
LINE 257: hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet,
LINE 258: looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke;
LINE 259: he at last said—
LINE 260: "Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another."
LINE 261: "I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot
LINE 262: return."
LINE 263: "But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry."
LINE 264: I was silent: I thought he mocked me.
LINE 265: "Come, Jane—come hither."
LINE 266: "Your bride stands between us."
LINE 267: He rose, and with a stride reached me.
LINE 268: "My bride is here," he said, again drawing me to him, "because my equal
LINE 269: is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?"
LINE 270: Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for
LINE 271: I was still incredulous.
LINE 272: "Do you doubt me, Jane?"
LINE 273: "Entirely."
LINE 274: "You have no faith in me?"
LINE 275: "Not a whit."
LINE 276: "Am I a liar in your eyes?" he asked passionately. "Little sceptic, you
LINE 277: _shall_ be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that
LINE 278: you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to
LINE 279: prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third
LINE 280: of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the
LINE 281: result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not—I
LINE 282: could not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost unearthly
LINE 283: thing!—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and
LINE 284: plain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband."
LINE 285: "What, me!" I ejaculated, beginning in his earnestness—and especially
LINE 286: in his incivility—to credit his sincerity: "me who have not a friend in
LINE 287: the world but you—if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you
LINE 288: have given me?"
LINE 289: "You, Jane, I must have you for my own—entirely my own. Will you be
LINE 290: mine? Say yes, quickly."
LINE 291: "Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight."
LINE 292: "Why?"
LINE 293: "Because I want to read your countenance—turn!"
LINE 294: "There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled,
LINE 295: scratched page. Read on: only make haste, for I suffer."
LINE 296: His face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were
LINE 297: strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
LINE 298: "Oh, Jane, you torture me!" he exclaimed. "With that searching and yet
LINE 299: faithful and generous look, you torture me!"
LINE 300: "How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only
LINE 301: feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion—they cannot torture."
LINE 302: "Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly—"Jane accept me quickly.
LINE 303: Say, Edward—give me my name—Edward—I will marry you."
LINE 304: "Are you in earnest? Do you truly love me? Do you sincerely wish me to
LINE 305: be your wife?"
LINE 306: "I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it."
LINE 307: "Then, sir, I will marry you."
LINE 308: "Edward—my little wife!"
LINE 309: "Dear Edward!"
LINE 310: "Come to me—come to me entirely now," said he; and added, in his
LINE 311: deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his cheek was laid on mine, "Make
LINE 312: my happiness—I will make yours."
LINE 313: "God pardon me!" he subjoined ere long; "and man meddle not with me: I
LINE 314: have her, and will hold her."
LINE 315: "There is no one to meddle, sir. I have no kindred to interfere."
LINE 316: "No—that is the best of it," he said. And if I had loved him less I
LINE 317: should have thought his accent and look of exultation savage; but,
LINE 318: sitting by him, roused from the nightmare of parting—called to the
LINE 319: paradise of union—I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so
LINE 320: abundant a flow. Again and again he said, "Are you happy, Jane?" And
LINE 321: again and again I answered, "Yes." After which he murmured, "It will
LINE 322: atone—it will atone. Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and
LINE 323: comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her? Is there
LINE 324: not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at
LINE 325: God's tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world's
LINE 326: judgment—I wash my hands thereof. For man's opinion—I defy it."
LINE 327: But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were
LINE 328: all in shadow: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was.
LINE 329: And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind
LINE 330: roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
LINE 331: "We must go in," said Mr. Rochester: "the weather changes. I could have
LINE 332: sat with thee till morning, Jane."
LINE 333: "And so," thought I, "could I with you." I should have said so,
LINE 334: perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was
LINE 335: looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and
LINE 336: I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's
LINE 337: shoulder.
LINE 338: The rain rushed down. He hurried me up the walk, through the grounds,
LINE 339: and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the
LINE 340: threshold. He was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the
LINE 341: water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her room.
LINE 342: I did not observe her at first, nor did Mr. Rochester. The lamp was
LINE 343: lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve.
LINE 344: "Hasten to take off your wet things," said he; "and before you go,
LINE 345: good-night—good-night, my darling!"
LINE 346: He kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his arms, there
LINE 347: stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed. I only smiled at her, and ran
LINE 348: upstairs. "Explanation will do for another time," thought I. Still,
LINE 349: when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she should even
LINE 350: temporarily misconstrue what she had seen. But joy soon effaced every
LINE 351: other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder
LINE 352: crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as
LINE 353: the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no
LINE 354: fear and little awe. Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course
LINE 355: of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort, that
LINE 356: was strength for anything.
LINE 357: Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adèle came running in to
LINE 358: tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had
LINE 359: been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
