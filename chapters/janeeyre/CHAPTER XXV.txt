LINE 1: The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being
LINE 2: numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal
LINE 3: day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. _I_, at least,
LINE 4: had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,
LINE 5: ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this
LINE 6: time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I
LINE 7: (D.V.),—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet
LINE 8: I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay,
LINE 9: four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written
LINE 10: the direction, "Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London," on each: I could not
LINE 11: persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester!
LINE 12: She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time
LINE 13: after eight o'clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had come
LINE 14: into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was
LINE 15: enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said
LINE 16: to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw
LINE 17: bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the
LINE 18: pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped
LINE 19: portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like
LINE 20: apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o'clock—gave out
LINE 21: certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. "I
LINE 22: will leave you by yourself, white dream," I said. "I am feverish: I
LINE 23: hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it."
LINE 24: It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not
LINE 25: only the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to
LINE 26: commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share,
LINE 27: doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me
LINE 28: forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause
LINE 29: influenced my mind more than they.
LINE 30: I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened
LINE 31: which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but
LINE 32: myself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that
LINE 33: night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had
LINE 34: called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty
LINE 35: miles off—business it was requisite he should settle in person,
LINE 36: previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited now his
LINE 37: return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of
LINE 38: the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I
LINE 39: disclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence.
LINE 40: I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day
LINE 41: had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a
LINE 42: speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to
LINE 43: augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one
LINE 44: way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once
LINE 45: in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads
LINE 46: northward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on
LINE 47: mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.
LINE 48: It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,
LINE 49: delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering
LINE 50: through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the
LINE 51: chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the
LINE 52: centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each
LINE 53: other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;
LINE 54: though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more:
LINE 55: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests
LINE 56: would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might
LINE 57: be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.
LINE 58: "You did right to hold fast to each other," I said: as if the
LINE 59: monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. "I think,
LINE 60: scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little
LINE 61: sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful,
LINE 62: honest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see
LINE 63: birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of
LINE 64: pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of
LINE 65: you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay." As I looked up
LINE 66: at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which
LINE 67: filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she
LINE 68: seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself
LINE 69: again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a
LINE 70: second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a
LINE 71: wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.
LINE 72: Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples
LINE 73: with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I
LINE 74: employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them
LINE 75: into the house and put them away in the store-room. Then I repaired to
LINE 76: the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer,
LINE 77: I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a
LINE 78: cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some
LINE 79: time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I
LINE 80: wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles
LINE 81: brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had
LINE 82: completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in
LINE 83: the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the
LINE 84: hall simultaneously struck ten.
LINE 85: "How late it grows!" I said. "I will run down to the gates: it is
LINE 86: moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be
LINE 87: coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense."
LINE 88: The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but
LINE 89: the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all
LINE 90: still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at
LINE 91: intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried
LINE 92: by one moving speck.
LINE 93: A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment
LINE 94: and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon
LINE 95: shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of
LINE 96: dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
LINE 97: "I wish he would come! I wish he would come!" I exclaimed, seized with
LINE 98: hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it
LINE 99: was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of
LINE 100: last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of
LINE 101: disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had
LINE 102: enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its
LINE 103: meridian, and must now decline.
LINE 104: "Well, I cannot return to the house," I thought; "I cannot sit by the
LINE 105: fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs
LINE 106: than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him."
LINE 107: I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of
LINE 108: a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a
LINE 109: dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he
LINE 110: was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had
LINE 111: opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took
LINE 112: his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him.
LINE 113: "There!" he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the
LINE 114: saddle: "You can't do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe;
LINE 115: give me both hands: mount!"
LINE 116: I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I
LINE 117: got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well
LINE 118: as I could. He checked himself in his exultation to demand, "But is
LINE 119: there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an
LINE 120: hour? Is there anything wrong?"
LINE 121: "No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in
LINE 122: the house for you, especially with this rain and wind."
LINE 123: "Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my
LINE 124: cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek
LINE 125: and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?"
LINE 126: "Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy."
LINE 127: "Then you have been both?"
LINE 128: "Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-by, sir; and I daresay
LINE 129: you will only laugh at me for my pains."
LINE 130: "I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare
LINE 131: not: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as
LINE 132: an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay
LINE 133: a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up
LINE 134: a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your
LINE 135: shepherd, did you, Jane?"
LINE 136: "I wanted you: but don't boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me
LINE 137: get down."
LINE 138: He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed
LINE 139: me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on,
LINE 140: and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for
LINE 141: the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I
LINE 142: long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I found him at supper.
LINE 143: "Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal
LINE 144: but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time."
LINE 145: I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.
LINE 146: "Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is
LINE 147: it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?"
LINE 148: "I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know
LINE 149: what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal."
LINE 150: "Except me: I am substantial enough—touch me."
LINE 151: "You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream."
LINE 152: He held out his hand, laughing. "Is that a dream?" said he, placing it
LINE 153: close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as
LINE 154: well as a long, strong arm.
LINE 155: "Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream," said I, as I put it down from
LINE 156: before my face. "Sir, have you finished supper?"
LINE 157: "Yes, Jane."
LINE 158: I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I
LINE 159: stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
LINE 160: "It is near midnight," I said.
LINE 161: "Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before
LINE 162: my wedding."
LINE 163: "I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have
LINE 164: no wish to go to bed."
LINE 165: "Are all your arrangements complete?"
LINE 166: "All, sir."
LINE 167: "And on my part likewise," he returned, "I have settled everything; and
LINE 168: we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our
LINE 169: return from church."
LINE 170: "Very well, sir."
LINE 171: "With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—'very well,'
LINE 172: Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how
LINE 173: strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?"
LINE 174: "I believe I am."
LINE 175: "Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel."
LINE 176: "I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this
LINE 177: present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may
LINE 178: come charged?"
LINE 179: "This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or
LINE 180: over-fatigued."
LINE 181: "Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?"
LINE 182: "Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart's core."
LINE 183: I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was
LINE 184: ardent and flushed.
LINE 185: "Give me your confidence, Jane," he said: "relieve your mind of any
LINE 186: weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?—that
LINE 187: I shall not prove a good husband?"
LINE 188: "It is the idea farthest from my thoughts."
LINE 189: "Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the
LINE 190: new life into which you are passing?"
LINE 191: "No."
LINE 192: "You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex
LINE 193: and pain me. I want an explanation."
LINE 194: "Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?"
LINE 195: "I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had
LINE 196: happened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in
LINE 197: short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said
LINE 198: something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your
LINE 199: sensitive self-respect has been wounded?"
LINE 200: "No, sir." It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded
LINE 201: its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then
LINE 202: I proceeded.
LINE 203: "All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless
LINE 204: bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting
LINE 205: fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to
LINE 206: have the hope of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don't
LINE 207: caress me now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in
LINE 208: Providence, and believed that events were working together for your
LINE 209: good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the
LINE 210: air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on
LINE 211: your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea,
LINE 212: thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely
LINE 213: missed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before
LINE 214: me—_your_ life, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my
LINE 215: own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs
LINE 216: are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why
LINE 217: moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like
LINE 218: a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went
LINE 219: in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they
LINE 220: had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present—the veil
LINE 221: which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London:
LINE 222: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into
LINE 223: accepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised
LINE 224: how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts
LINE 225: to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought
LINE 226: how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had
LINE 227: myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was
LINE 228: not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither
LINE 229: fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and
LINE 230: heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of
LINE 231: any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your
LINE 232: standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet."
LINE 233: "How well you read me, you witch!" interposed Mr. Rochester: "but what
LINE 234: did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison,
LINE 235: or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?"
LINE 236: "No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found
LINE 237: nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me,
LINE 238: because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark,
LINE 239: the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and
LINE 240: high—but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie. I wished you
LINE 241: were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair
LINE 242: and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I
LINE 243: could not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The gale
LINE 244: still rising seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound;
LINE 245: whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it
LINE 246: recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it
LINE 247: must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On
LINE 248: sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I
LINE 249: continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange,
LINE 250: regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all my
LINE 251: first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total
LINE 252: obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge
LINE 253: of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk,
LINE 254: and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I
LINE 255: thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I
LINE 256: strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to
LINE 257: utter your name and entreat you to stop—but my movements were fettered,
LINE 258: and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew
LINE 259: farther and farther every moment."
LINE 260: "And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to
LINE 261: you? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of
LINE 262: real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget that;
LINE 263: and you cannot deny it. _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your
LINE 264: lips. I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but
LINE 265: sweet as music—'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of
LINE 266: living with you, Edward, because I love you.' Do you love me,
LINE 267: Jane?—repeat it."
LINE 268: "I do, sir—I do, with my whole heart."
LINE 269: "Well," he said, after some minutes' silence, "it is strange; but that
LINE 270: sentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because you
LINE 271: said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward
LINE 272: gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is
LINE 273: too much as if some spirit were near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know
LINE 274: well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me
LINE 275: you hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather
LINE 276: be incensed than saddened."
LINE 277: "I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have
LINE 278: finished my tale: but hear me to the end."
LINE 279: "I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source
LINE 280: of your melancholy in a dream."
LINE 281: I shook my head. "What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be
LINE 282: anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on."
LINE 283: The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his
LINE 284: manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.
LINE 285: "I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin,
LINE 286: the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front
LINE 287: nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very
LINE 288: fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the
LINE 289: grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and
LINE 290: there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still
LINE 291: carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,
LINE 292: however tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress,
LINE 293: I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the
LINE 294: road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and
LINE 295: for a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous
LINE 296: haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones
LINE 297: rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the
LINE 298: child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I
LINE 299: gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening
LINE 300: every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on
LINE 301: the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an
LINE 302: angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall
LINE 303: crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my
LINE 304: balance, fell, and woke."
LINE 305: "Now, Jane, that is all."
LINE 306: "All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam
LINE 307: dazzled my eyes; I thought—Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it
LINE 308: was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a
LINE 309: light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before
LINE 310: going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard
LINE 311: a rustling there. I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?' No one
LINE 312: answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held
LINE 313: it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.
LINE 314: 'Sophie! Sophie!' I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen
LINE 315: up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over
LINE 316: me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this
LINE 317: was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was
LINE 318: not—no, I was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange
LINE 319: woman, Grace Poole."
LINE 320: "It must have been one of them," interrupted my master.
LINE 321: "No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing
LINE 322: before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield
LINE 323: Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me."
LINE 324: "Describe it, Jane."
LINE 325: "It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair
LINE 326: hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was
LINE 327: white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell."
LINE 328: "Did you see her face?"
LINE 329: "Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held
LINE 330: it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and
LINE 331: turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage
LINE 332: and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass."
LINE 333: "And how were they?"
LINE 334: "Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was
LINE 335: a discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll
LINE 336: of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!"
LINE 337: "Ghosts are usually pale, Jane."
LINE 338: "This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow
LINE 339: furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.
LINE 340: Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?"
LINE 341: "You may."
LINE 342: "Of the foul German spectre—the Vampyre."
LINE 343: "Ah!—what did it do?"
LINE 344: "Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
LINE 345: flinging both on the floor, trampled on them."
LINE 346: It removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and
LINE 347: flinging both on the floor, trampled on them
LINE 348: "Afterwards?"
LINE 349: "It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn
LINE 350: approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door. Just at
LINE 351: my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me—she
LINE 352: thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my
LINE 353: eyes. I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost
LINE 354: consciousness: for the second time in my life—only the second time—I
LINE 355: became insensible from terror."
LINE 356: "Who was with you when you revived?"
LINE 357: "No one, sir, but the broad day. I rose, bathed my head and face in
LINE 358: water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill,
LINE 359: and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision. Now,
LINE 360: sir, tell me who and what that woman was?"
LINE 361: "The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be
LINE 362: careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough
LINE 363: handling."
LINE 364: "Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real:
LINE 365: the transaction actually took place."
LINE 366: "And your previous dreams, were they real too? Is Thornfield Hall a
LINE 367: ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you
LINE 368: without a tear—without a kiss—without a word?"
LINE 369: "Not yet."
LINE 370: "Am I about to do it? Why, the day is already commenced which is to
LINE 371: bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no
LINE 372: recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that."
LINE 373: "Mental terrors, sir! I wish I could believe them to be only such: I
LINE 374: wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the
LINE 375: mystery of that awful visitant."
LINE 376: "And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal."
LINE 377: "But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I
LINE 378: looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful
LINE 379: aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there—on the carpet—I
LINE 380: saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,—the veil, torn from
LINE 381: top to bottom in two halves!"
LINE 382: I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round
LINE 383: me. "Thank God!" he exclaimed, "that if anything malignant did come
LINE 384: near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed. Oh, to think
LINE 385: what might have happened!"
LINE 386: He drew his breath short, and strained me so close to him, I could
LINE 387: scarcely pant. After some minutes' silence, he continued, cheerily—
LINE 388: "Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half
LINE 389: reality. A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman
LINE 390: was—must have been—Grace Poole. You call her a strange being yourself:
LINE 391: from all you know, you have reason so to call her—what did she do to
LINE 392: me? what to Mason? In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed
LINE 393: her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you
LINE 394: were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own:
LINE 395: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated
LINE 396: stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the
LINE 397: spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her. I see you
LINE 398: would ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been
LINE 399: married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now. Are you
LINE 400: satisfied, Jane? Do you accept my solution of the mystery?"
LINE 401: I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one:
LINE 402: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear
LINE 403: so—relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented
LINE 404: smile. And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
LINE 405: "Does not Sophie sleep with Adèle in the nursery?" he asked, as I lit
LINE 406: my candle.
LINE 407: "Yes, sir."
LINE 408: "And there is room enough in Adèle's little bed for you. You must share
LINE 409: it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have
LINE 410: related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep
LINE 411: alone: promise me to go to the nursery."
LINE 412: "I shall be very glad to do so, sir."
LINE 413: "And fasten the door securely on the inside. Wake Sophie when you go
LINE 414: upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time
LINE 415: to-morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before
LINE 416: eight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.
LINE 417: Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is
LINE 418: no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here" (he lifted
LINE 419: up the curtain)—"it is a lovely night!"
LINE 420: It was. Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping
LINE 421: before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off
LINE 422: eastward in long, silvered columns. The moon shone peacefully.
LINE 423: "Well," said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, "how is my
LINE 424: Janet now?"
LINE 425: "The night is serene, sir; and so am I."
LINE 426: "And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy
LINE 427: love and blissful union."
LINE 428: This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of
LINE 429: sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.
LINE 430: With little Adèle in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood—so
LINE 431: tranquil, so passionless, so innocent—and waited for the coming day:
LINE 432: all my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun
LINE 433: rose I rose too. I remember Adèle clung to me as I left her: I remember
LINE 434: I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried
LINE 435: over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs
LINE 436: would break her still sound repose. She seemed the emblem of my past
LINE 437: life; and he, I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored,
LINE 438: type of my unknown future day.
