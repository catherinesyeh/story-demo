LINE 1: Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month
LINE 2: elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after
LINE 3: the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off
LINE 4: to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr.
LINE 5: Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister's interment and settle
LINE 6: the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with
LINE 7: Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in
LINE 8: her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her
LINE 9: feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and
LINE 10: did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that
LINE 11: while I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, "If you and I
LINE 12: were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence
LINE 13: matters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into
LINE 14: being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour,
LINE 15: and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I
LINE 16: should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling,
LINE 17: half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only because
LINE 18: our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly
LINE 19: mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and
LINE 20: compliant on my part."
LINE 21: At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me
LINE 22: to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention,
LINE 23: she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day
LINE 24: long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling
LINE 25: trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication
LINE 26: with any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers,
LINE 27: and answer notes of condolence.
LINE 28: One morning she told me I was at liberty. "And," she added, "I am
LINE 29: obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There
LINE 30: is some difference between living with such an one as you and with
LINE 31: Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
LINE 32: To-morrow," she continued, "I set out for the Continent. I shall take
LINE 33: up my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call
LINE 34: it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a
LINE 35: time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful
LINE 36: study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half
LINE 37: suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all
LINE 38: things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and
LINE 39: probably take the veil."
LINE 40: I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to
LINE 41: dissuade her from it. "The vocation will fit you to a hair," I thought:
LINE 42: "much good may it do you!"
LINE 43: When we parted, she said: "Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:
LINE 44: you have some sense."
LINE 45: I then returned: "You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you
LINE 46: have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French
LINE 47: convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't
LINE 48: much care."
LINE 49: "You are in the right," said she; and with these words we each went our
LINE 50: separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or
LINE 51: her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an
LINE 52: advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that
LINE 53: Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the
LINE 54: convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she
LINE 55: endowed with her fortune.
LINE 56: How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or
LINE 57: short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had
LINE 58: known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long
LINE 59: walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was
LINE 60: to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a
LINE 61: good fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings
LINE 62: was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,
LINE 63: increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return
LINE 64: to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
LINE 65: My journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night
LINE 66: spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve
LINE 67: hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured
LINE 68: and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on
LINE 69: the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and
LINE 70: servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent
LINE 71: church, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I
LINE 72: beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a
LINE 73: convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities
LINE 74: of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of ——
LINE 75: scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down
LINE 76: on my traveller's bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
LINE 77: I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not
LINE 78: long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim
LINE 79: of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had
LINE 80: left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in
LINE 81: a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make
LINE 82: arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new
LINE 83: carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed
LINE 84: strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had
LINE 85: herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly
LINE 86: take place. "You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,"
LINE 87: was my mental comment. "I don't doubt it."
LINE 88: The question followed, "Where was I to go?" I dreamt of Miss Ingram all
LINE 89: the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of
LINE 90: Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.
LINE 91: Rochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it
LINE 92: seemed, at both her and me.
LINE 93: I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I
LINE 94: did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed
LINE 95: to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving
LINE 96: my box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about
LINE 97: six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a
LINE 98: road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
LINE 99: It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft:
LINE 100: the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far
LINE 101: from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its
LINE 102: blue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata
LINE 103: high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it—it
LINE 104: seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen
LINE 105: of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
LINE 106: I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped
LINE 107: once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it
LINE 108: was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to
LINE 109: a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.
LINE 110: "Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure," said I; "and
LINE 111: little Adèle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very
LINE 112: well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking
LINE 113: of you."
LINE 114: But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience?
LINE 115: These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of
LINE 116: again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and
LINE 117: they added—"Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more
LINE 118: days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!" And then
LINE 119: I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not
LINE 120: persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on.
LINE 121: They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the
LINE 122: labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their
LINE 123: rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field
LINE 124: or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the
LINE 125: gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather
LINE 126: any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy
LINE 127: and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone
LINE 128: steps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in
LINE 129: his hand; he is writing.
LINE 130: Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a
LINE 131: moment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I
LINE 132: should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the
LINE 133: power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can stir:
LINE 134: I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way to the
LINE 135: house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.
LINE 136: "Hillo!" he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. "There you
LINE 137: are! Come on, if you please."
LINE 138: I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being
LINE 139: scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm;
LINE 140: and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel
LINE 141: rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had
LINE 142: resolved to conceal. But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet
LINE 143: to behave with decent composure.
LINE 144: "And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?
LINE 145: Yes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come
LINE 146: clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into
LINE 147: the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a
LINE 148: dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last
LINE 149: month?"
LINE 150: "I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead."
LINE 151: "A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! She comes from the other
LINE 152: world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she
LINE 153: meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I'd touch you, to see
LINE 154: if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I'd as soon offer to take
LINE 155: hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh. Truant! truant!" he
LINE 156: added, when he had paused an instant. "Absent from me a whole month,
LINE 157: and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!"
LINE 158: I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though
LINE 159: broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by
LINE 160: the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.
LINE 161: Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of
LINE 162: communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered
LINE 163: to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially. His last
LINE 164: words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him
LINE 165: whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my
LINE 166: home—would that it were my home!
LINE 167: He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I
LINE 168: inquired soon if he had not been to London.
LINE 169: "Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight."
LINE 170: "Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter."
LINE 171: "And did she inform you what I went to do?"
LINE 172: "Oh, yes, sir! Everybody knew your errand."
LINE 173: "You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it
LINE 174: will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen
LINE 175: Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I
LINE 176: were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally. Tell me now,
LINE 177: fairy as you are—can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something
LINE 178: of that sort, to make me a handsome man?"
LINE 179: "It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added,
LINE 180: "A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough;
LINE 181: or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
LINE 182: Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to
LINE 183: me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my
LINE 184: abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had
LINE 185: of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think
LINE 186: it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he
LINE 187: shed it over me now.
LINE 188: "Pass, Janet," said he, making room for me to cross the stile: "go up
LINE 189: home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's
LINE 190: threshold."
LINE 191: All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to
LINE 192: colloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to
LINE 193: leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. I
LINE 194: said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—
LINE 195: "Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad
LINE 196: to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only
LINE 197: home."
LINE 198: I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he
LINE 199: tried. Little Adèle was half wild with delight when she saw me. Mrs.
LINE 200: Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and
LINE 201: even Sophie bid me "bon soir" with glee. This was very pleasant; there
LINE 202: is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and
LINE 203: feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
LINE 204: I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my
LINE 205: ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and
LINE 206: coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her
LINE 207: knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adèle, kneeling on
LINE 208: the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection
LINE 209: seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent
LINE 210: prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus
LINE 211: sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to
LINE 212: take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he
LINE 213: supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted
LINE 214: daughter back again, and added that he saw Adèle was "prête à croquer
LINE 215: sa petite maman Anglaise"—I half ventured to hope that he would, even
LINE 216: after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his
LINE 217: protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
LINE 218: A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.
LINE 219: Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation
LINE 220: going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if
LINE 221: she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the
LINE 222: negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.
LINE 223: Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had
LINE 224: answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could
LINE 225: not tell what to make of him.
LINE 226: One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no
LINE 227: journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure
LINE 228: it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was
LINE 229: that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a
LINE 230: horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride. I began to
LINE 231: cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken
LINE 232: off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had
LINE 233: changed their minds. I used to look at my master's face to see if it
LINE 234: were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been
LINE 235: so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and
LINE 236: my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable
LINE 237: dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently
LINE 238: to his presence; never been kinder to me when there—and, alas! never
LINE 239: had I loved him so well.
