LINE 1: The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.
LINE 2: In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all
LINE 3: day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all
LINE 4: their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid
LINE 5: them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure
LINE 6: in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the
LINE 7: pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and
LINE 8: principles.
LINE 9: I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted
LINE 10: me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered
LINE 11: home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof,
LINE 12: its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged
LINE 13: firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden,
LINE 14: dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest
LINE 15: species would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung
LINE 16: to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale
LINE 17: into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended,
LINE 18: and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the
LINE 19: wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,
LINE 20: or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little
LINE 21: mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect
LINE 22: enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share
LINE 23: both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I
LINE 24: felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline
LINE 25: of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell
LINE 26: by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
LINE 27: and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
LINE 28: to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
LINE 29: and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
LINE 30: sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
LINE 31: me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my
LINE 32: faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
LINE 33: Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and
LINE 34: better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of
LINE 35: knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent
LINE 36: me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening
LINE 37: what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met
LINE 38: opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.
LINE 39: If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
LINE 40: Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In
LINE 41: her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of
LINE 42: flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I
LINE 43: could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of
LINE 44: vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's
LINE 45: feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and
LINE 46: Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but
LINE 47: touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I
LINE 48: saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar
LINE 49: pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual
LINE 50: affection—of the strongest kind—was the result. They discovered I could
LINE 51: draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service. My
LINE 52: skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed
LINE 53: them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would
LINE 54: take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus
LINE 55: occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks
LINE 56: like days.
LINE 57: As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and
LINE 58: rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of
LINE 59: the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively
LINE 60: seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to
LINE 61: visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his
LINE 62: parish.
LINE 63: No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or
LINE 64: fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his
LINE 65: hat, and, followed by his father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his
LINE 66: mission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.
LINE 67: Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would
LINE 68: expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than
LINE 69: cheerful—
LINE 70: "And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from
LINE 71: these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I
LINE 72: propose to myself?"
LINE 73: Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some
LINE 74: minutes of apparently mournful meditation.
LINE 75: But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to
LINE 76: friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even
LINE 77: of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in
LINE 78: his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental
LINE 79: serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every
LINE 80: sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening,
LINE 81: when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would
LINE 82: cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver
LINE 83: himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was
LINE 84: perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and
LINE 85: changeful dilation of his eye.
LINE 86: I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight
LINE 87: it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a
LINE 88: strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection
LINE 89: for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was
LINE 90: more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the
LINE 91: sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for
LINE 92: the sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the
LINE 93: thousand peaceful delights they could yield.
LINE 94: Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an
LINE 95: opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre
LINE 96: when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could
LINE 97: describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render
LINE 98: faithfully the effect it produced on me.
LINE 99: It began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went,
LINE 100: it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal
LINE 101: breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous
LINE 102: language. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The
LINE 103: heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher:
LINE 104: neither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an
LINE 105: absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic
LINE 106: doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each
LINE 107: reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
LINE 108: When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened
LINE 109: by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed
LINE 110: to me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to
LINE 111: which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid
LINE 112: dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate
LINE 113: yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John
LINE 114: Rivers—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found
LINE 115: that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found
LINE 116: it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my
LINE 117: broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided
LINE 118: referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
LINE 119: Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor
LINE 120: House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited
LINE 121: them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,
LINE 122: where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty
LINE 123: members they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither
LINE 124: knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only
LINE 125: their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their
LINE 126: cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing
LINE 127: to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it
LINE 128: became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning,
LINE 129: being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to
LINE 130: approach the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated
LINE 131: as a kind of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well
LINE 132: knowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times
LINE 133: difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as
LINE 134: his—when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a
LINE 135: dialogue.
LINE 136: Looking up as I drew near—"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
LINE 137: "Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer
LINE 138: myself to undertake?"
LINE 139: "I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you
LINE 140: seemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become
LINE 141: attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed
LINE 142: it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their
LINE 143: approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary."
LINE 144: "And they will go in three days now?" I said.
LINE 145: "Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:
LINE 146: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up."
LINE 147: I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first
LINE 148: broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection:
LINE 149: his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to
LINE 150: recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious
LINE 151: interest to me.
LINE 152: "What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay
LINE 153: will not have increased the difficulty of securing it."
LINE 154: "Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give,
LINE 155: and you to accept."
LINE 156: He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew
LINE 157: impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance
LINE 158: fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as
LINE 159: words could have done, and with less trouble.
LINE 160: "You need be in no hurry to hear," he said: "let me frankly tell you, I
LINE 161: have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain,
LINE 162: recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,
LINE 163: it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find
LINE 164: that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining
LINE 165: to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind,
LINE 166: and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in
LINE 167: front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole
LINE 168: descendants of the race, two earn the dependent's crust among
LINE 169: strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native
LINE 170: country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound
LINE 171: to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day
LINE 172: when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his
LINE 173: shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest
LINE 174: members he is one, shall give the word, 'Rise, follow Me!'"
LINE 175: St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,
LINE 176: deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of
LINE 177: glance. He resumed—
LINE 178: "And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service
LINE 179: of poverty and obscurity. _You_ may even think it degrading—for I see
LINE 180: now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes
LINE 181: lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the
LINE 182: educated; but _I_ consider that no service degrades which can better
LINE 183: our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the
LINE 184: Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the
LINE 185: meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such
LINE 186: circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of
LINE 187: the Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer,
LINE 188: Himself."
LINE 189: "Well?" I said, as he again paused—"proceed."
LINE 190: He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to
LINE 191: read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.
LINE 192: The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his
LINE 193: succeeding observations.
LINE 194: "I believe you will accept the post I offer you," said he, "and hold it
LINE 195: for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently
LINE 196: keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English
LINE 197: country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to
LINE 198: repose as that in mine, though of a different kind."
LINE 199: "Do explain," I urged, when he halted once more.
LINE 200: "I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how
LINE 201: cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,
LINE 202: and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the
LINE 203: course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to
LINE 204: the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years
LINE 205: ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every
LINE 206: hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a
LINE 207: second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with
LINE 208: a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house. Her
LINE 209: salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,
LINE 210: very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;
LINE 211: the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the
LINE 212: proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same
LINE 213: lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the
LINE 214: workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial
LINE 215: offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation
LINE 216: of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will
LINE 217: you be this mistress?"
LINE 218: He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an
LINE 219: indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing
LINE 220: all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell
LINE 221: in what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was humble—but
LINE 222: then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but
LINE 223: then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was
LINE 224: independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul
LINE 225: like iron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I
LINE 226: made my decision.
LINE 227: "I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my
LINE 228: heart."
LINE 229: "But you comprehend me?" he said. "It is a village school: your
LINE 230: scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers' children—at the best,
LINE 231: farmers' daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will
LINE 232: be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your
LINE 233: accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your
LINE 234: mind—sentiments—tastes?"
LINE 235: "Save them till they are wanted. They will keep."
LINE 236: "You know what you undertake, then?"
LINE 237: "I do."
LINE 238: He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased
LINE 239: and deeply gratified.
LINE 240: "And when will you commence the exercise of your function?"
LINE 241: "I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like,
LINE 242: next week."
LINE 243: "Very well: so be it."
LINE 244: He rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at
LINE 245: me. He shook his head.
LINE 246: "What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?" I asked.
LINE 247: "You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!"
LINE 248: "Why? What is your reason for saying so?"
LINE 249: "I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises
LINE 250: the maintenance of an even tenor in life."
LINE 251: "I am not ambitious."
LINE 252: He started at the word "ambitious." He repeated, "No. What made you
LINE 253: think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find
LINE 254: it out?"
LINE 255: "I was speaking of myself."
LINE 256: "Well, if you are not ambitious, you are—" He paused.
LINE 257: "What?"
LINE 258: "I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have
LINE 259: misunderstood the word, and been displeased. I mean, that human
LINE 260: affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. I am sure
LINE 261: you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to
LINE 262: devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of
LINE 263: stimulus: any more than I can be content," he added, with emphasis, "to
LINE 264: live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains—my nature, that God
LINE 265: gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed—made
LINE 266: useless. You hear now how I contradict myself. I, who preached
LINE 267: contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of
LINE 268: hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service—I, His ordained
LINE 269: minister, almost rave in my restlessness. Well, propensities and
LINE 270: principles must be reconciled by some means."
LINE 271: He left the room. In this brief hour I had learnt more of him than in
LINE 272: the whole previous month: yet still he puzzled me.
LINE 273: Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached
LINE 274: for leaving their brother and their home. They both tried to appear as
LINE 275: usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could
LINE 276: not be entirely conquered or concealed. Diana intimated that this would
LINE 277: be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. It would
LINE 278: probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it
LINE 279: might be a parting for life.
LINE 280: "He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves," she said: "natural
LINE 281: affection and feelings more potent still. St. John looks quiet, Jane;
LINE 282: but he hides a fever in his vitals. You would think him gentle, yet in
LINE 283: some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my
LINE 284: conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe
LINE 285: decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it. It is
LINE 286: right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!" And the tears gushed
LINE 287: to her fine eyes. Mary bent her head low over her work.
LINE 288: "We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,"
LINE 289: she murmured.
LINE 290: At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by
LINE 291: fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that "misfortunes never
LINE 292: come singly," and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip
LINE 293: between the cup and the lip. St. John passed the window reading a
LINE 294: letter. He entered.
LINE 295: "Our uncle John is dead," said he.
LINE 296: Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings
LINE 297: appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
LINE 298: "Dead?" repeated Diana.
LINE 299: "Yes."
LINE 300: She riveted a searching gaze on her brother's face. "And what then?"
LINE 301: she demanded, in a low voice.
LINE 302: "What then, Die?" he replied, maintaining a marble immobility of
LINE 303: feature. "What then? Why—nothing. Read."
LINE 304: He threw the letter into her lap. She glanced over it, and handed it to
LINE 305: Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her brother. All
LINE 306: three looked at each other, and all three smiled—a dreary, pensive
LINE 307: smile enough.
LINE 308: "Amen! We can yet live," said Diana at last.
LINE 309: "At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before," remarked
LINE 310: Mary.
LINE 311: "Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might
LINE 312: have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly
LINE 313: with what _is_."
LINE 314: He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
LINE 315: For some minutes no one spoke. Diana then turned to me.
LINE 316: "Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries," she said, "and think
LINE 317: us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a
LINE 318: relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him. He was
LINE 319: my mother's brother. My father and he quarrelled long ago. It was by
LINE 320: his advice that my father risked most of his property in the
LINE 321: speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them:
LINE 322: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged
LINE 323: afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a
LINE 324: fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no
LINE 325: near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely
LINE 326: related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would
LINE 327: atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter
LINE 328: informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,
LINE 329: with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John,
LINE 330: Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. He
LINE 331: had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp
LINE 332: is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary and I would
LINE 333: have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St.
LINE 334: John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have
LINE 335: enabled him to do."
LINE 336: This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further
LINE 337: reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his sisters. The next day
LINE 338: I left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it
LINE 339: for distant B——. In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the
LINE 340: parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned.
