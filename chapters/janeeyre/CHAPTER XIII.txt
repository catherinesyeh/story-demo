LINE 1: Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early
LINE 2: that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down,
LINE 3: it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were
LINE 4: arrived, and waiting to speak with him.
LINE 5: Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily
LINE 6: requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an
LINE 7: apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for
LINE 8: the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that
LINE 9: Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it
LINE 10: echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the
LINE 11: bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in
LINE 12: different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through
LINE 13: it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.
LINE 14: Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept
LINE 15: running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could
LINE 16: get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go
LINE 17: downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,
LINE 18: where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and
LINE 19: made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her "ami,
LINE 20: Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester," as she dubbed him (I had not
LINE 21: before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had
LINE 22: brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that
LINE 23: when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a
LINE 24: little box in whose contents she had an interest.
LINE 25: "Et cela doit signifier," said she, "qu'il y aura là dedans un cadeau
LINE 26: pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parlé
LINE 27: de vous: il m'a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'était
LINE 28: pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle. J'ai dit qu'oui:
LINE 29: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?"
LINE 30: I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon
LINE 31: was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I
LINE 32: allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,
LINE 33: from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals
LINE 34: to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.
LINE 35: Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:
LINE 36: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very
LINE 37: shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the
LINE 38: fireside.
LINE 39: In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I
LINE 40: remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when
LINE 41: Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I
LINE 42: had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome
LINE 43: thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
LINE 44: "Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with
LINE 45: him in the drawing-room this evening," said she: "he has been so much
LINE 46: engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before."
LINE 47: "When is his tea-time?" I inquired.
LINE 48: "Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had
LINE 49: better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is
LINE 50: a candle."
LINE 51: "Is it necessary to change my frock?"
LINE 52: "Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester
LINE 53: is here."
LINE 54: This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired
LINE 55: to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress
LINE 56: by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had,
LINE 57: except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette,
LINE 58: I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
LINE 59: "You want a brooch," said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl
LINE 60: ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,
LINE 61: and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was
LINE 62: rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's
LINE 63: presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept
LINE 64: in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose
LINE 65: curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
LINE 66: Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;
LINE 67: basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt
LINE 68: near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot
LINE 69: supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire
LINE 70: shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty
LINE 71: eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of
LINE 72: his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for
LINE 73: character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;
LINE 74: his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no
LINE 75: mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in
LINE 76: squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the
LINE 77: athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though
LINE 78: neither tall nor graceful.
LINE 79: Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and
LINE 80: myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he
LINE 81: never lifted his head as we approached.
LINE 82: "Here is Miss Eyre, sir," said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He
LINE 83: bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.
LINE 84: "Let Miss Eyre be seated," said he: and there was something in the
LINE 85: forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed
LINE 86: further to express, "What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be
LINE 87: there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her."
LINE 88: I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness
LINE 89: would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it
LINE 90: by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me
LINE 91: under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the
LINE 92: freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of
LINE 93: the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go
LINE 94: on.
LINE 95: He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs.
LINE 96: Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable,
LINE 97: and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she
LINE 98: condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on
LINE 99: the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then
LINE 100: she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.
LINE 101: "Madam, I should like some tea," was the sole rejoinder she got. She
LINE 102: hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to
LINE 103: arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle
LINE 104: went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.
LINE 105: "Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?" said Mrs. Fairfax to me; "Adèle
LINE 106: might perhaps spill it."
LINE 107: I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking
LINE 108: the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—
LINE 109: "N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre
LINE 110: dans votre petit coffre?"
LINE 111: "Who talks of cadeaux?" said he gruffly. "Did you expect a present,
LINE 112: Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?" and he searched my face with eyes
LINE 113: that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
LINE 114: "I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are
LINE 115: generally thought pleasant things."
LINE 116: "Generally thought? But what do _you_ think?"
LINE 117: "I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an
LINE 118: answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has
LINE 119: it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as
LINE 120: to its nature."
LINE 121: "Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a
LINE 122: 'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the
LINE 123: bush."
LINE 124: "Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can
LINE 125: prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for
LINE 126: she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings;
LINE 127: but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a
LINE 128: stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment."
LINE 129: "Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adèle, and find
LINE 130: you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no
LINE 131: talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement."
LINE 132: "Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the
LINE 133: meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils' progress."
LINE 134: "Humph!" said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.
LINE 135: "Come to the fire," said the master, when the tray was taken away, and
LINE 136: Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle
LINE 137: was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful
LINE 138: books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières. We obeyed, as in
LINE 139: duty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered
LINE 140: to amuse herself with Pilot.
LINE 141: "You have been resident in my house three months?"
LINE 142: "Yes, sir."
LINE 143: "And you came from—?"
LINE 144: "From Lowood school, in ——shire."
LINE 145: "Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?"
LINE 146: "Eight years."
LINE 147: "Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in
LINE 148: such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have
LINE 149: rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that
LINE 150: sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought
LINE 151: unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you
LINE 152: had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?"
LINE 153: "I have none."
LINE 154: "Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?"
LINE 155: "No."
LINE 156: "I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on
LINE 157: that stile?"
LINE 158: "For whom, sir?"
LINE 159: "For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did
LINE 160: I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on
LINE 161: the causeway?"
LINE 162: I shook my head. "The men in green all forsook England a hundred years
LINE 163: ago," said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. "And not even in
LINE 164: Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I
LINE 165: don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine
LINE 166: on their revels more."
LINE 167: Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows,
LINE 168: seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.
LINE 169: "Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have
LINE 170: some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
LINE 171: "No; none that I ever saw."
LINE 172: "And your home?"
LINE 173: "I have none."
LINE 174: "Where do your brothers and sisters live?"
LINE 175: "I have no brothers or sisters."
LINE 176: "Who recommended you to come here?"
LINE 177: "I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement."
LINE 178: "Yes," said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, "and
LINE 179: I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre
LINE 180: has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher
LINE 181: to Adèle."
LINE 182: "Don't trouble yourself to give her a character," returned Mr.
LINE 183: Rochester: "eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She
LINE 184: began by felling my horse."
LINE 185: "Sir?" said Mrs. Fairfax.
LINE 186: "I have to thank her for this sprain."
LINE 187: The widow looked bewildered.
LINE 188: "Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?"
LINE 189: "No, sir."
LINE 190: "Have you seen much society?"
LINE 191: "None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of
LINE 192: Thornfield."
LINE 193: "Have you read much?"
LINE 194: "Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or
LINE 195: very learned."
LINE 196: "You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in
LINE 197: religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a
LINE 198: parson, is he not?"
LINE 199: "Yes, sir."
LINE 200: "And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of
LINE 201: religieuses would worship their director."
LINE 202: "Oh, no."
LINE 203: "You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That
LINE 204: sounds blasphemous."
LINE 205: "I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is
LINE 206: a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for
LINE 207: economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could
LINE 208: hardly sew."
LINE 209: "That was very false economy," remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again
LINE 210: caught the drift of the dialogue.
LINE 211: "And was that the head and front of his offending?" demanded Mr.
LINE 212: Rochester.
LINE 213: "He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision
LINE 214: department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with
LINE 215: long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his
LINE 216: own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid
LINE 217: to go to bed."
LINE 218: "What age were you when you went to Lowood?"
LINE 219: "About ten."
LINE 220: "And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?"
LINE 221: I assented.
LINE 222: "Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have
LINE 223: been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the
LINE 224: features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And
LINE 225: now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?"
LINE 226: "A little."
LINE 227: "Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—I mean,
LINE 228: if you please.—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,'
LINE 229: and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new
LINE 230: inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the
LINE 231: door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune."
LINE 232: I departed, obeying his directions.
LINE 233: "Enough!" he called out in a few minutes. "You play _a little_, I see;
LINE 234: like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some,
LINE 235: but not well."
LINE 236: I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued—
LINE 237: "Adèle showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.
LINE 238: I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a
LINE 239: master aided you?"
LINE 240: "No, indeed!" I interjected.
LINE 241: "Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch
LINE 242: for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you
LINE 243: are certain: I can recognise patchwork."
LINE 244: "Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir."
LINE 245: I brought the portfolio from the library.
LINE 246: "Approach the table," said he; and I wheeled it to his couch. Adèle and
LINE 247: Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
LINE 248: "No crowding," said Mr. Rochester: "take the drawings from my hand as I
LINE 249: finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine."
LINE 250: He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid
LINE 251: aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.
LINE 252: "Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax," said he, "and look at
LINE 253: them with Adèle;—you" (glancing at me) "resume your seat, and answer my
LINE 254: questions. I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that
LINE 255: hand yours?"
LINE 256: "Yes."
LINE 257: "And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and
LINE 258: some thought."
LINE 259: "I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no
LINE 260: other occupation."
LINE 261: "Where did you get your copies?"
LINE 262: "Out of my head."
LINE 263: "That head I see now on your shoulders?"
LINE 264: "Yes, sir."
LINE 265: "Has it other furniture of the same kind within?"
LINE 266: "I should think it may have: I should hope—better."
LINE 267: He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.
LINE 268: While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and
LINE 269: first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful. The subjects
LINE 270: had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual
LINE 271: eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand
LINE 272: would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a
LINE 273: pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.
LINE 274: These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low
LINE 275: and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;
LINE 276: so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there
LINE 277: was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged
LINE 278: mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with
LINE 279: foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched
LINE 280: with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering
LINE 281: distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and
LINE 282: mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was
LINE 283: the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or
LINE 284: torn.
LINE 285: The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a
LINE 286: hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and
LINE 287: above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into
LINE 288: the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and
LINE 289: soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the
LINE 290: lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes
LINE 291: shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud
LINE 292: torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection
LINE 293: like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds
LINE 294: from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
LINE 295: The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter
LINE 296: sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close
LINE 297: serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the
LINE 298: foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and
LINE 299: resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and
LINE 300: supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow
LINE 301: quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of
LINE 302: meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above
LINE 303: the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in
LINE 304: its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,
LINE 305: gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was "the
LINE 306: likeness of a kingly crown;" what it diademed was "the shape which
LINE 307: shape had none."
LINE 308: "Were you happy when you painted these pictures?" asked Mr. Rochester
LINE 309: presently.
LINE 310: "I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short,
LINE 311: was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known."
LINE 312: "That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have
LINE 313: been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland
LINE 314: while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them
LINE 315: long each day?"
LINE 316: "I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at
LINE 317: them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of
LINE 318: the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply."
LINE 319: "And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?"
LINE 320: "Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my
LINE 321: handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite
LINE 322: powerless to realise."
LINE 323: "Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,
LINE 324: probably. You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give
LINE 325: it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to
LINE 326: the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must
LINE 327: have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet
LINE 328: not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what
LINE 329: meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint
LINE 330: wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did
LINE 331: you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!"
LINE 332: I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his
LINE 333: watch, he said abruptly—
LINE 334: "It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adèle sit up
LINE 335: so long? Take her to bed."
LINE 336: Adèle went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,
LINE 337: but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor
LINE 338: so much.
LINE 339: "I wish you all good-night, now," said he, making a movement of the
LINE 340: hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and
LINE 341: wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my
LINE 342: portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so
LINE 343: withdrew.
LINE 344: "You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax," I
LINE 345: observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adèle to bed.
LINE 346: "Well, is he?"
LINE 347: "I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt."
LINE 348: "True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed
LINE 349: to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities
LINE 350: of temper, allowance should be made."
LINE 351: "Why?"
LINE 352: "Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature;
LINE 353: and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him,
LINE 354: and make his spirits unequal."
LINE 355: "What about?"
LINE 356: "Family troubles, for one thing."
LINE 357: "But he has no family."
LINE 358: "Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder
LINE 359: brother a few years since."
LINE 360: "His _elder_ brother?"
LINE 361: "Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of
LINE 362: the property; only about nine years."
LINE 363: "Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as
LINE 364: to be still inconsolable for his loss?"
LINE 365: "Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings
LINE 366: between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;
LINE 367: and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was
LINE 368: fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did
LINE 369: not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious
LINE 370: that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of
LINE 371: the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that
LINE 372: were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr.
LINE 373: Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he
LINE 374: considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what
LINE 375: the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his
LINE 376: spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very
LINE 377: forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led
LINE 378: an unsettled kind of life. I don't think he has ever been resident at
LINE 379: Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother
LINE 380: without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he
LINE 381: shuns the old place."
LINE 382: "Why should he shun it?"
LINE 383: "Perhaps he thinks it gloomy."
LINE 384: The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.
LINE 385: Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit
LINE 386: information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials. She
LINE 387: averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was
LINE 388: chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to
LINE 389: drop the subject, which I did accordingly.
