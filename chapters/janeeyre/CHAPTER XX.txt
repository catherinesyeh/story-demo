LINE 1: I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to
LINE 2: let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon,
LINE 3: which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course
LINE 4: to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me
LINE 5: through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the
LINE 6: dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal
LINE 7: clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half rose, and stretched my
LINE 8: arm to draw the curtain.
LINE 9: Good God! What a cry!
LINE 10: The night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,
LINE 11: a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
LINE 12: My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.
LINE 13: The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that
LINE 14: fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor
LINE 15: on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the
LINE 16: cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must
LINE 17: rest ere it could repeat the effort.
LINE 18: It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And
LINE 19: overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a
LINE 20: struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered
LINE 21: voice shouted—
LINE 22: "Help! help! help!" three times rapidly.
LINE 23: "Will no one come?" it cried; and then, while the staggering and
LINE 24: stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—
LINE 25: "Rochester! Rochester! for God's sake, come!"
LINE 26: A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.
LINE 27: Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and
LINE 28: there was silence.
LINE 29: I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued
LINE 30: from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,
LINE 31: terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one
LINE 32: looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and
LINE 33: ladies alike had quitted their beds; and "Oh! what is it?"—"Who is
LINE 34: hurt?"—"What has happened?"—"Fetch a light!"—"Is it fire?"—"Are there
LINE 35: robbers?"—"Where shall we run?" was demanded confusedly on all hands.
LINE 36: But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They
LINE 37: ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the
LINE 38: confusion was inextricable.
LINE 39: "Where the devil is Rochester?" cried Colonel Dent. "I cannot find him
LINE 40: in his bed."
LINE 41: "Here! here!" was shouted in return. "Be composed, all of you: I'm
LINE 42: coming."
LINE 43: And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester
LINE 44: advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.
LINE 45: One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss
LINE 46: Ingram.
LINE 47: "What awful event has taken place?" said she. "Speak! let us know the
LINE 48: worst at once!"
LINE 49: "But don't pull me down or strangle me," he replied: for the Misses
LINE 50: Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white
LINE 51: wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.
LINE 52: "All's right!—all's right!" he cried. "It's a mere rehearsal of Much
LINE 53: Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous."
LINE 54: And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself
LINE 55: by an effort, he added—
LINE 56: "A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She's an excitable,
LINE 57: nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or
LINE 58: something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now,
LINE 59: then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is
LINE 60: settled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to
LINE 61: set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in
LINE 62: evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your
LINE 63: nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames" (to the dowagers),
LINE 64: "you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill
LINE 65: gallery any longer."
LINE 66: And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to
LINE 67: get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did
LINE 68: not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as
LINE 69: unnoticed I had left it.
LINE 70: Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself
LINE 71: carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that
LINE 72: had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had
LINE 73: proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not
LINE 74: a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and
LINE 75: that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention
LINE 76: framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for
LINE 77: emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out
LINE 78: over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not
LINE 79: what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,
LINE 80: struggle, and call.
LINE 81: No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and
LINE 82: in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It
LINE 83: seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon
LINE 84: declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and
LINE 85: darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was. I
LINE 86: left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I
LINE 87: stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
LINE 88: "Am I wanted?" I asked.
LINE 89: "Are you up?" asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master's.
LINE 90: "Yes, sir."
LINE 91: "And dressed?"
LINE 92: "Yes."
LINE 93: "Come out, then, quietly."
LINE 94: I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.
LINE 95: "I want you," he said: "come this way: take your time, and make no
LINE 96: noise."
LINE 97: My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a
LINE 98: cat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the
LINE 99: dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and
LINE 100: stood at his side.
LINE 101: "Have you a sponge in your room?" he asked in a whisper.
LINE 102: "Yes, sir."
LINE 103: "Have you any salts—volatile salts?"
LINE 104: "Yes."
LINE 105: "Go back and fetch both."
LINE 106: I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,
LINE 107: and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his
LINE 108: hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;
LINE 109: he paused, and addressed me again.
LINE 110: "You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?"
LINE 111: "I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet."
LINE 112: I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no
LINE 113: faintness.
LINE 114: "Just give me your hand," he said: "it will not do to risk a fainting
LINE 115: fit."
LINE 116: I put my fingers into his. "Warm and steady," was his remark: he turned
LINE 117: the key and opened the door.
LINE 118: I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax
LINE 119: showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry
LINE 120: was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had
LINE 121: then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out of the room
LINE 122: within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog
LINE 123: quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, "Wait
LINE 124: a minute," and he went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of
LINE 125: laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace
LINE 126: Poole's own goblin ha! ha! _She_ then was there. He made some sort of
LINE 127: arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him:
LINE 128: he came out and closed the door behind him.
LINE 129: "Here, Jane!" he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large
LINE 130: bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of
LINE 131: the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,
LINE 132: dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant
LINE 133: back; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I
LINE 134: recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:
LINE 135: I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in
LINE 136: blood.
LINE 137: "Hold the candle," said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a
LINE 138: basin of water from the washstand: "Hold that," said he. I obeyed. He
LINE 139: took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he
LINE 140: asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason
LINE 141: shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt
LINE 142: of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged
LINE 143: away blood, trickling fast down.
LINE 144: "Is there immediate danger?" murmured Mr. Mason.
LINE 145: "Pooh! No—a mere scratch. Don't be so overcome, man: bear up! I'll
LINE 146: fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by
LINE 147: morning, I hope. Jane," he continued.
LINE 148: "Sir?"
LINE 149: "I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an
LINE 150: hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it
LINE 151: returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that
LINE 152: stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to
LINE 153: him on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if
LINE 154: you speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I'll not answer
LINE 155: for the consequences."
LINE 156: Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,
LINE 157: either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
LINE 158: Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded
LINE 159: to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then saying,
LINE 160: "Remember!—No conversation," he left the room. I experienced a strange
LINE 161: feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating
LINE 162: step ceased to be heard.
LINE 163: Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic
LINE 164: cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and
LINE 165: hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that
LINE 166: was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of
LINE 167: Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
LINE 168: I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly
LINE 169: countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now
LINE 170: shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me,
LINE 171: and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again
LINE 172: and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling
LINE 173: gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my
LINE 174: employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round
LINE 175: me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver
LINE 176: strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,
LINE 177: divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the
LINE 178: twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;
LINE 179: while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
LINE 180: According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here
LINE 181: or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his
LINE 182: brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face
LINE 183: of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and
LINE 184: threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his
LINE 185: subordinate's form.
LINE 186: Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the
LINE 187: movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since
LINE 188: Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but
LINE 189: three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal
LINE 190: of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
LINE 191: Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived
LINE 192: incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled
LINE 193: nor subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and
LINE 194: now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it,
LINE 195: that, masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice,
LINE 196: now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
LINE 197: And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he
LINE 198: become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at
LINE 199: him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely
LINE 200: season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr.
LINE 201: Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here! And why,
LINE 202: now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did
LINE 203: he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why
LINE 204: _did_ Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been
LINE 205: outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted
LINE 206: against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in
LINE 207: oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that
LINE 208: the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness
LINE 209: of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me
LINE 210: of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive
LINE 211: disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active
LINE 212: energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when
LINE 213: he heard of Mr. Mason's arrival? Why had the mere name of this
LINE 214: unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a
LINE 215: child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on
LINE 216: an oak?
LINE 217: Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:
LINE 218: "Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane." I could not forget
LINE 219: how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no
LINE 220: light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the
LINE 221: vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
LINE 222: "When will he come? When will he come?" I cried inwardly, as the night
LINE 223: lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:
LINE 224: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water
LINE 225: to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating
LINE 226: salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental
LINE 227: suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast
LINE 228: prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and
LINE 229: lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.
LINE 230: The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived
LINE 231: streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then
LINE 232: approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant
LINE 233: kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five
LINE 234: minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was
LINE 235: relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has
LINE 236: seemed shorter.
LINE 237: Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
LINE 238: "Now, Carter, be on the alert," he said to this last: "I give you but
LINE 239: half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting
LINE 240: the patient downstairs and all."
LINE 241: "But is he fit to move, sir?"
LINE 242: "No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must
LINE 243: be kept up. Come, set to work."
LINE 244: Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,
LINE 245: let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to
LINE 246: see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to
LINE 247: brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was
LINE 248: already handling.
LINE 249: "Now, my good fellow, how are you?" he asked.
LINE 250: "She's done for me, I fear," was the faint reply.
LINE 251: "Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the
LINE 252: worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all. Carter, assure him
LINE 253: there's no danger."
LINE 254: "I can do that conscientiously," said Carter, who had now undone the
LINE 255: bandages; "only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have
LINE 256: bled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well
LINE 257: as cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth
LINE 258: here!"
LINE 259: "She bit me," he murmured. "She worried me like a tigress, when
LINE 260: Rochester got the knife from her."
LINE 261: "You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at
LINE 262: once," said Mr. Rochester.
LINE 263: "But under such circumstances, what could one do?" returned Mason. "Oh,
LINE 264: it was frightful!" he added, shuddering. "And I did not expect it: she
LINE 265: looked so quiet at first."
LINE 266: "I warned you," was his friend's answer; "I said—be on your guard when
LINE 267: you go near her. Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had
LINE 268: me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and
LINE 269: alone."
LINE 270: "I thought I could have done some good."
LINE 271: "You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,
LINE 272: however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not
LINE 273: taking my advice; so I'll say no more. Carter—hurry!—hurry! The sun
LINE 274: will soon rise, and I must have him off."
LINE 275: "Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this
LINE 276: other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think."
LINE 277: "She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
LINE 278: I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,
LINE 279: horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he
LINE 280: only said—
LINE 281: "Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat
LINE 282: it."
LINE 283: "I wish I could forget it," was the answer.
LINE 284: "You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish
LINE 285: Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not
LINE 286: think of her at all."
LINE 287: "Impossible to forget this night!"
LINE 288: "It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as
LINE 289: dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking
LINE 290: now. There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent
LINE 291: in a trice. Jane" (he turned to me for the first time since his
LINE 292: re-entrance), "take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk
LINE 293: straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the
LINE 294: wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them
LINE 295: here; and be nimble."
LINE 296: I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles
LINE 297: named, and returned with them.
LINE 298: "Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his
LINE 299: toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again."
LINE 300: I retired as directed.
LINE 301: "Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr.
LINE 302: Rochester presently.
LINE 303: "No, sir; all was very still."
LINE 304: "We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for
LINE 305: your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven
LINE 306: long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here,
LINE 307: Carter, help him on with his waist-coat. Where did you leave your
LINE 308: furred cloak? You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this
LINE 309: damned cold climate. In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's
LINE 310: room,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there."
LINE 311: Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and
LINE 312: edged with fur.
LINE 313: "Now, I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must
LINE 314: away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a
LINE 315: clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You must open
LINE 316: the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a
LINE 317: little glass you will find there,—quick!"
LINE 318: I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
LINE 319: "That's well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a
LINE 320: dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of
LINE 321: an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not
LINE 322: a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as
LINE 323: now, for instance. Jane, a little water."
LINE 324: He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle
LINE 325: on the washstand.
LINE 326: "That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial."
LINE 327: I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented
LINE 328: it to Mason.
LINE 329: "Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or
LINE 330: so."
LINE 331: "But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?"
LINE 332: "Drink! drink! drink!"
LINE 333: Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was
LINE 334: dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and
LINE 335: sullied. Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed
LINE 336: the liquid; he then took his arm—
LINE 337: "Now I am sure you can get on your feet," he said—"try."
LINE 338: The patient rose.
LINE 339: "Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard;
LINE 340: step out—that's it!"
LINE 341: "I do feel better," remarked Mr. Mason.
LINE 342: "I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;
LINE 343: unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise
LINE 344: you will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive
LINE 345: his rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and,
LINE 346: Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
LINE 347: It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of
LINE 348: rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage
LINE 349: door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all
LINE 350: the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a
LINE 351: post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,
LINE 352: stationed outside. I approached him, and said the gentlemen were
LINE 353: coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The
LINE 354: stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet
LINE 355: drawn over the servants' chamber windows; little birds were just
LINE 356: twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped
LINE 357: like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the
LINE 358: carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all
LINE 359: else was still.
LINE 360: The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the
LINE 361: surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the
LINE 362: chaise; Carter followed.
LINE 363: "Take care of him," said Mr. Rochester to the latter, "and keep him at
LINE 364: your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to
LINE 365: see how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?"
LINE 366: "The fresh air revives me, Fairfax."
LINE 367: "Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,
LINE 368: Dick."
LINE 369: "Fairfax—"
LINE 370: "Well what is it?"
LINE 371: "Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be:
LINE 372: let her—" he stopped and burst into tears.
LINE 373: "I do my best; and have done it, and will do it," was the answer: he
LINE 374: shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
LINE 375: "Yet would to God there was an end of all this!" added Mr. Rochester,
LINE 376: as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
LINE 377: This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in
LINE 378: the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me,
LINE 379: prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call
LINE 380: "Jane!" He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
LINE 381: "Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments," he said; "that
LINE 382: house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?"
LINE 383: "It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir."
LINE 384: "The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes," he answered; "and you
LINE 385: see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is
LINE 386: slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,
LINE 387: and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now _here_"
LINE 388: (he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) "all is real, sweet,
LINE 389: and pure."
LINE 390: He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees,
LINE 391: and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all
LINE 392: sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses,
LINE 393: pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant
LINE 394: herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,
LINE 395: followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just
LINE 396: entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and
LINE 397: dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.
LINE 398: "Jane, will you have a flower?"
LINE 399: He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to
LINE 400: me.
LINE 401: "Thank you, sir."
LINE 402: "Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light
LINE 403: clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid
LINE 404: and balmly atmosphere?"
LINE 405: "I do, very much."
LINE 406: "You have passed a strange night, Jane."
LINE 407: "Yes, sir."
LINE 408: "And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone
LINE 409: with Mason?"
LINE 410: "I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room."
LINE 411: "But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have
LINE 412: been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a
LINE 413: wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe."
LINE 414: "Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?"
LINE 415: "Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your
LINE 416: thoughts."
LINE 417: "Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays."
LINE 418: "Never fear—I will take care of myself."
LINE 419: "Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?"
LINE 420: "I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.
LINE 421: To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack
LINE 422: and spue fire any day."
LINE 423: "But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is
LINE 424: evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or
LINE 425: wilfully injure you."
LINE 426: "Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,
LINE 427: unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive
LINE 428: me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness."
LINE 429: "Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him
LINE 430: how to avert the danger."
LINE 431: He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it
LINE 432: from him.
LINE 433: "If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated
LINE 434: in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to
LINE 435: him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done. But I cannot give him
LINE 436: orders in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for
LINE 437: it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is
LINE 438: possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are
LINE 439: my little friend, are you not?"
LINE 440: "I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right."
LINE 441: "Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and
LINE 442: mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing
LINE 443: me—working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say,
LINE 444: '_all that is right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong,
LINE 445: there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no
LINE 446: lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me,
LINE 447: quiet and pale, and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot
LINE 448: do it, because it is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed
LINE 449: star. Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare
LINE 450: not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you
LINE 451: are, you should transfix me at once."
LINE 452: "If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,
LINE 453: you are very safe."
LINE 454: "God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down."
LINE 455: The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a
LINE 456: rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but
LINE 457: I stood before him.
LINE 458: "Sit," he said; "the bench is long enough for two. You don't hesitate
LINE 459: to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?"
LINE 460: I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been
LINE 461: unwise.
LINE 462: "Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the
LINE 463: flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their
LINE 464: young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do
LINE 465: their first spell of work—I'll put a case to you, which you must
LINE 466: endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you
LINE 467: are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you
LINE 468: err in staying."
LINE 469: "No, sir; I am content."
LINE 470: "Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a
LINE 471: girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from
LINE 472: childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive
LINE 473: that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from
LINE 474: what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life
LINE 475: and taint all your existence. Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not
LINE 476: speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make
LINE 477: the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_. The results of
LINE 478: what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you
LINE 479: take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful
LINE 480: nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the
LINE 481: very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which
LINE 482: you feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base
LINE 483: associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here
LINE 484: and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in
LINE 485: heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights
LINE 486: feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of
LINE 487: voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no
LINE 488: matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities
LINE 489: which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;
LINE 490: and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such
LINE 491: society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher
LINE 492: wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to
LINE 493: spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal
LINE 494: being. To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle
LINE 495: of custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience
LINE 496: sanctifies nor your judgment approves?"
LINE 497: He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good
LINE 498: spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain
LINE 499: aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle
LINE 500: Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the
LINE 501: tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
LINE 502: Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:
LINE 503: "Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man
LINE 504: justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for
LINE 505: ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own
LINE 506: peace of mind and regeneration of life?"
LINE 507: "Sir," I answered, "a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation
LINE 508: should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die;
LINE 509: philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one
LINE 510: you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals
LINE 511: for strength to amend and solace to heal."
LINE 512: "But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the
LINE 513: instrument. I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,
LINE 514: dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for
LINE 515: my cure in—"
LINE 516: He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I
LINE 517: almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch
LINE 518: the suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many
LINE 519: minutes—so long was the silence protracted. At last I looked up at the
LINE 520: tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.
LINE 521: "Little friend," said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face
LINE 522: changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh
LINE 523: and sarcastic—"you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram:
LINE 524: don't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a
LINE 525: vengeance?"
LINE 526: He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when
LINE 527: he came back he was humming a tune.
LINE 528: "Jane, Jane," said he, stopping before me, "you are quite pale with
LINE 529: your vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?"
LINE 530: "Curse you? No, sir."
LINE 531: "Shake hands in confirmation of the word. What cold fingers! They were
LINE 532: warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious
LINE 533: chamber. Jane, when will you watch with me again?"
LINE 534: "Whenever I can be useful, sir."
LINE 535: "For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be
LINE 536: able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?
LINE 537: To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know
LINE 538: her."
LINE 539: "Yes, sir."
LINE 540: "She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"
LINE 541: "Yes, sir."
LINE 542: "A strapper—a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair
LINE 543: just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there's
LINE 544: Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that
LINE 545: wicket."
LINE 546: As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying
LINE 547: cheerfully—
LINE 548: "Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before
LINE 549: sunrise: I rose at four to see him off."
