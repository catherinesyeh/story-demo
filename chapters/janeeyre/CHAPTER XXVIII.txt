LINE 1: Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me
LINE 2: down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the
LINE 3: sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the
LINE 4: world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment
LINE 5: I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the
LINE 6: coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it
LINE 7: must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.
LINE 8: Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set
LINE 9: up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at
LINE 10: a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the
LINE 11: nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription,
LINE 12: distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known
LINE 13: names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a
LINE 14: north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I
LINE 15: see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are
LINE 16: waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The
LINE 17: population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads:
LINE 18: they stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely;
LINE 19: they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to
LINE 20: their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no
LINE 21: eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering
LINE 22: here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be
LINE 23: questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and
LINE 24: excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this
LINE 25: moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none
LINE 26: that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no
LINE 27: relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and
LINE 28: ask repose.
LINE 29: I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply
LINE 30: furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I
LINE 31: turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in
LINE 32: a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me;
LINE 33: the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
LINE 34: Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread
LINE 35: that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might
LINE 36: discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it
LINE 37: was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
LINE 38: Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep
LINE 39: silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took
LINE 40: confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched,
LINE 41: dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.
LINE 42: What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could
LINE 43: do nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my
LINE 44: weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold
LINE 45: charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant
LINE 46: sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale
LINE 47: could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
LINE 48: I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the
LINE 49: summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled
LINE 50: just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness;
LINE 51: no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she
LINE 52: loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only
LINE 53: mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.
LINE 54: To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother
LINE 55: would lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of
LINE 56: bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed
LINE 57: through at noon with a stray penny—my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries
LINE 58: gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a
LINE 59: handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if
LINE 60: not satisfied, appeased by this hermit's meal. I said my evening
LINE 61: prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.
LINE 62: I said my evening prayers
LINE 63: Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were
LINE 64: buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for
LINE 65: the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over
LINE 66: me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was
LINE 67: not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.
LINE 68: My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It
LINE 69: plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It
LINE 70: trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter
LINE 71: pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird
LINE 72: with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain
LINE 73: attempts to seek him.
LINE 74: Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was
LINE 75: come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for
LINE 76: the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but
LINE 77: certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest
LINE 78: scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His
LINE 79: worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude,
LINE 80: His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for
LINE 81: Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty
LINE 82: Milky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept
LINE 83: space like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God.
LINE 84: Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew
LINE 85: that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I
LINE 86: turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the
LINE 87: Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God's, and by God
LINE 88: would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere
LINE 89: long in sleep forgot sorrow.
LINE 90: But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little
LINE 91: birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime
LINE 92: of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long
LINE 93: morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got
LINE 94: up, and I looked round me.
LINE 95: What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading
LINE 96: moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw
LINE 97: a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet
LINE 98: bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that
LINE 99: I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was
LINE 100: a human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where
LINE 101: there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the bed I
LINE 102: had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had
LINE 103: that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and
LINE 104: that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with
LINE 105: fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil
LINE 106: of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all
LINE 107: its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be
LINE 108: carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the
LINE 109: responsibility fulfilled. I set out.
LINE 110: Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now
LINE 111: fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my
LINE 112: choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done
LINE 113: enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost
LINE 114: overpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a
LINE 115: stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart
LINE 116: and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.
LINE 117: I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic
LINE 118: hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw
LINE 119: a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of
LINE 120: pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran
LINE 121: zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the
LINE 122: sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of
LINE 123: wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up
LINE 124: the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human life
LINE 125: and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend
LINE 126: to toil like the rest.
LINE 127: About two o'clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of its one
LINE 128: street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.
LINE 129: I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain
LINE 130: a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The
LINE 131: wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I
LINE 132: was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint
LINE 133: with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could
LINE 134: offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small
LINE 135: silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly
LINE 136: tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did
LINE 137: not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably
LINE 138: they would not; but I must try.
LINE 139: I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed
LINE 140: person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How
LINE 141: could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter
LINE 142: the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,
LINE 143: the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only
LINE 144: begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in
LINE 145: the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request. She
LINE 146: pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; but
LINE 147: conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained
LINE 148: it. Soon I asked her "if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman
LINE 149: in the village?"
LINE 150: "Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for."
LINE 151: I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face
LINE 152: with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource,
LINE 153: without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must
LINE 154: apply somewhere. Where?
LINE 155: "Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was
LINE 156: wanted?"
LINE 157: "Nay; she couldn't say."
LINE 158: "What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people
LINE 159: do?"
LINE 160: "Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's
LINE 161: needle-factory, and at the foundry."
LINE 162: "Did Mr. Oliver employ women?"
LINE 163: "Nay; it was men's work."
LINE 164: "And what do the women do?"
LINE 165: "I knawn't," was the answer. "Some does one thing, and some another.
LINE 166: Poor folk mun get on as they can."
LINE 167: She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I
LINE 168: to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently
LINE 169: wanted. I took leave.
LINE 170: I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the
LINE 171: right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an
LINE 172: inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to
LINE 173: a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much
LINE 174: exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside
LINE 175: into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed,
LINE 176: I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a
LINE 177: resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the
LINE 178: top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and
LINE 179: brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach
LINE 180: the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it
LINE 181: possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve
LINE 182: me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young
LINE 183: woman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a
LINE 184: hopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and
LINE 185: faltering—I asked if a servant was wanted here?
LINE 186: "No," said she; "we do not keep a servant."
LINE 187: "Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?" I
LINE 188: continued. "I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want
LINE 189: some work: no matter what."
LINE 190: But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:
LINE 191: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,
LINE 192: position, tale. She shook her head, she "was sorry she could give me no
LINE 193: information," and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but
LINE 194: it shut me out. If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I
LINE 195: should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
LINE 196: I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no
LINE 197: prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to
LINE 198: a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer
LINE 199: inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's
LINE 200: cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a
LINE 201: chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the
LINE 202: vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.
LINE 203: I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I
LINE 204: wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim
LINE 205: to ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the
LINE 206: afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and
LINE 207: starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I
LINE 208: hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a
LINE 209: garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was
LINE 210: the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where
LINE 211: they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the
LINE 212: clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman's function to
LINE 213: help—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves. I seemed
LINE 214: to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my
LINE 215: courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I
LINE 216: reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman
LINE 217: opened: I asked was this the parsonage?
LINE 218: "Yes."
LINE 219: "Was the clergyman in?"
LINE 220: "No."
LINE 221: "Would he be in soon?"
LINE 222: "No, he was gone from home."
LINE 223: "To a distance?"
LINE 224: "Not so far—happen three mile. He had been called away by the sudden
LINE 225: death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely
LINE 226: stay there a fortnight longer."
LINE 227: "Was there any lady of the house?"
LINE 228: "Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;" and of her,
LINE 229: reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was
LINE 230: sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
LINE 231: Once more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes
LINE 232: of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful
LINE 233: to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to
LINE 234: the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others
LINE 235: were there besides the woman I ventured the request—"Would she give me
LINE 236: a roll for this handkerchief?"
LINE 237: She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i'
LINE 238: that way."
LINE 239: Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. "How
LINE 240: could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?" she said.
LINE 241: "Would she take my gloves?"
LINE 242: "No! what could she do with them?"
LINE 243: Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is
LINE 244: enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I
LINE 245: can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral
LINE 246: degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a
LINE 247: recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who
LINE 248: repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not
LINE 249: be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a
LINE 250: well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was
LINE 251: employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?
LINE 252: Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and
LINE 253: who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not
LINE 254: take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if
LINE 255: the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me
LINE 256: condense now. I am sick of the subject.
LINE 257: A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which
LINE 258: the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I
LINE 259: stopped and said—
LINE 260: "Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry." He cast on
LINE 261: me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice
LINE 262: from his loaf, and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a
LINE 263: beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to
LINE 264: his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down
LINE 265: and ate it.
LINE 266: I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the
LINE 267: wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest
LINE 268: broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed
LINE 269: near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my
LINE 270: quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards
LINE 271: morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask
LINE 272: me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought
LINE 273: work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did
LINE 274: food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about
LINE 275: to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. "Will you give me
LINE 276: that?" I asked.
LINE 277: "Will you give me that?" I asked
LINE 278: She stared at me. "Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me
LINE 279: to give her these porridge."
LINE 280: "Well lass," replied a voice within, "give it her if she's a beggar. T'
LINE 281: pig doesn't want it."
LINE 282: The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it
LINE 283: ravenously.
LINE 284: As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path,
LINE 285: which I had been pursuing an hour or more.
LINE 286: "My strength is quite failing me," I said in a soliloquy. "I feel I
LINE 287: cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While
LINE 288: the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?
LINE 289: I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be
LINE 290: very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this
LINE 291: sense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood,
LINE 292: though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself
LINE 293: to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
LINE 294: Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die
LINE 295: of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh,
LINE 296: Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!—direct me!"
LINE 297: My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had
LINE 298: strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very
LINE 299: cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and
LINE 300: by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a
LINE 301: few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which
LINE 302: they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
LINE 303: "Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented
LINE 304: road," I reflected. "And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens
LINE 305: there be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that
LINE 306: they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's
LINE 307: grave."
LINE 308: To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find
LINE 309: a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not
LINE 310: secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no
LINE 311: variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes;
LINE 312: black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I
LINE 313: could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light
LINE 314: and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
LINE 315: My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,
LINE 316: vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in
LINE 317: among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. "That is an _ignis
LINE 318: fatuus_," was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It
LINE 319: burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. "Is
LINE 320: it, then, a bonfire just kindled?" I questioned. I watched to see
LINE 321: whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not
LINE 322: enlarge. "It may be a candle in a house," I then conjectured; "but if
LINE 323: so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a
LINE 324: yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have
LINE 325: it shut in my face."
LINE 326: And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I
LINE 327: lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and
LINE 328: died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to
LINE 329: the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly
LINE 330: numbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;
LINE 331: but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere
LINE 332: long.
LINE 333: The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I
LINE 334: tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It
LINE 335: led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been
LINE 336: impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the
LINE 337: height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my
LINE 338: faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
LINE 339: Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I
LINE 340: approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the
LINE 341: light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of
LINE 342: trees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character
LINE 343: of their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I
LINE 344: drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my
LINE 345: hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones
LINE 346: of a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high
LINE 347: and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before
LINE 348: me: it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On
LINE 349: each side stood a sable bush—holly or yew.
LINE 350: Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house
LINE 351: rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone
LINE 352: nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared
LINE 353: it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out
LINE 354: the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small
LINE 355: latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the
LINE 356: growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered
LINE 357: thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The
LINE 358: aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been
LINE 359: deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of
LINE 360: foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a
LINE 361: room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with
LINE 362: pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a
LINE 363: glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some
LINE 364: chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table;
LINE 365: and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but
LINE 366: scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.
LINE 367: I noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing
LINE 368: extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,
LINE 369: sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young,
LINE 370: graceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair,
LINE 371: the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and
LINE 372: bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and
LINE 373: faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of
LINE 374: one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
LINE 375: A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were
LINE 376: they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the
LINE 377: table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and
LINE 378: cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I
LINE 379: gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call
LINE 380: them handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each
LINE 381: bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand
LINE 382: between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which
LINE 383: they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller
LINE 384: books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to
LINE 385: aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all
LINE 386: the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so
LINE 387: hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock
LINE 388: tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the
LINE 389: click-click of the woman's knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice
LINE 390: broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.
LINE 391: "Listen, Diana," said one of the absorbed students; "Franz and old
LINE 392: Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream
LINE 393: from which he has awakened in terror—listen!" And in a low voice she
LINE 394: read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it
LINE 395: was in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were
LINE 396: Greek or German I could not tell.
LINE 397: "That is strong," she said, when she had finished: "I relish it." The
LINE 398: other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,
LINE 399: while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later
LINE 400: day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the
LINE 401: line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on
LINE 402: sounding brass to me—conveying no meaning:—
LINE 403: "'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.' Good! good!"
LINE 404: she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. "There you have a
LINE 405: dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a
LINE 406: hundred pages of fustian. 'Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines
LINE 407: Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.' I like it!"
LINE 408: Both were again silent.
LINE 409: "Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?" asked the old
LINE 410: woman, looking up from her knitting.
LINE 411: "Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no
LINE 412: other way."
LINE 413: "Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other:
LINE 414: and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?"
LINE 415: "We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we
LINE 416: are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don't speak German, and
LINE 417: we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us."
LINE 418: "And what good does it do you?"
LINE 419: "We mean to teach it some time—or at least the elements, as they say;
LINE 420: and then we shall get more money than we do now."
LINE 421: "Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night."
LINE 422: "I think we have: at least I'm tired. Mary, are you?"
LINE 423: "Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with
LINE 424: no master but a lexicon."
LINE 425: "It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious
LINE 426: Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home."
LINE 427: "Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little
LINE 428: gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you
LINE 429: have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?"
LINE 430: The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:
LINE 431: soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.
LINE 432: "Ah, childer!" said she, "it fair troubles me to go into yond' room
LINE 433: now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a
LINE 434: corner."
LINE 435: She wiped her eyes with her apron: the two girls, grave before, looked
LINE 436: sad now.
LINE 437: "But he is in a better place," continued Hannah: "we shouldn't wish him
LINE 438: here again. And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had."
LINE 439: "You say he never mentioned us?" inquired one of the ladies.
LINE 440: "He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father. He
LINE 441: had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and
LINE 442: when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for,
LINE 443: he fair laughed at him. He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his
LINE 444: head the next day—that is, a fortnight sin'—and he went to sleep and
LINE 445: niver wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t'
LINE 446: chamber and fand him. Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock—for
LINE 447: ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for
LINE 448: all your mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned. She
LINE 449: wor the pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father."
LINE 450: I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant (for
LINE 451: such I now concluded her to be) saw the difference. Both were fair
LINE 452: complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of
LINE 453: distinction and intelligence. One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker
LINE 454: than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing
LINE 455: it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's
LINE 456: duskier tresses covered her neck with thick curls. The clock struck
LINE 457: ten.
LINE 458: "Ye'll want your supper, I am sure," observed Hannah; "and so will Mr.
LINE 459: St. John when he comes in."
LINE 460: And she proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed
LINE 461: about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so
LINE 462: intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited
LINE 463: in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched
LINE 464: position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than
LINE 465: ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to
LINE 466: touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them
LINE 467: believe in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a
LINE 468: rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it
LINE 469: hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah
LINE 470: opened.
LINE 471: "What do you want?" she inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she
LINE 472: surveyed me by the light of the candle she held.
LINE 473: "May I speak to your mistresses?" I said.
LINE 474: "You had better tell me what you have to say to them. Where do you come
LINE 475: from?"
LINE 476: "I am a stranger."
LINE 477: "What is your business here at this hour?"
LINE 478: "I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of
LINE 479: bread to eat."
LINE 480: Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face. "I'll
LINE 481: give you a piece of bread," she said, after a pause; "but we can't take
LINE 482: in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely."
LINE 483: "Do let me speak to your mistresses."
LINE 484: "No, not I. What can they do for you? You should not be roving about
LINE 485: now; it looks very ill."
LINE 486: "But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?"
LINE 487: "Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don't
LINE 488: do wrong, that's all. Here is a penny; now go—"
LINE 489: "A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don't
LINE 490: shut the door:—oh, don't, for God's sake!"
LINE 491: "I must; the rain is driving in—"
LINE 492: "Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—"
LINE 493: "Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't
LINE 494: make such a noise. Move off."
LINE 495: "But I must die if I am turned away."
LINE 496: "Not you. I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you
LINE 497: about folk's houses at this time o' night. If you've any
LINE 498: followers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them
LINE 499: we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs,
LINE 500: and guns." Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to
LINE 501: and bolted it within.
LINE 502: This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true
LINE 503: despair—rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another
LINE 504: step could I stir. I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned—I wrung my
LINE 505: hands—I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death! Oh, this last
LINE 506: hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishment
LINE 507: from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude
LINE 508: was gone—at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to
LINE 509: regain.
LINE 510: "I can but die," I said, "and I believe in God. Let me try to wait His
LINE 511: will in silence."
LINE 512: These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my
LINE 513: misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain
LINE 514: there—dumb and still.
LINE 515: "All men must die," said a voice quite close at hand; "but all are not
LINE 516: condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would
LINE 517: be if you perished here of want."
LINE 518: "Who or what speaks?" I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and
LINE 519: incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was
LINE 520: near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented
LINE 521: me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed
LINE 522: to the door.
LINE 523: "Is it you, Mr. St. John?" cried Hannah.
LINE 524: "Yes—yes; open quickly."
LINE 525: "Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is! Come
LINE 526: in—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad
LINE 527: folks about. There has been a beggar-woman—I declare she is not gone
LINE 528: yet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!"
LINE 529: "Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your
LINE 530: duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and
LINE 531: listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at
LINE 532: least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the
LINE 533: house."
LINE 534: Hush, Hannah; I have a word to say to the woman
LINE 535: With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean,
LINE 536: bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an
LINE 537: aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two
LINE 538: ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing
LINE 539: at me.
LINE 540: "St. John, who is it?" I heard one ask.
LINE 541: "I cannot tell: I found her at the door," was the reply.
LINE 542: "She does look white," said Hannah.
LINE 543: "As white as clay or death," was responded. "She will fall: let her
LINE 544: sit."
LINE 545: And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still
LINE 546: possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.
LINE 547: "Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she
LINE 548: is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!"
LINE 549: "A mere spectre!"
LINE 550: "Is she ill, or only famished?"
LINE 551: "Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of
LINE 552: bread."
LINE 553: Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and
LINE 554: the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and
LINE 555: put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,
LINE 556: and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too,
LINE 557: the same balm-like emotion spoke: "Try to eat."
LINE 558: "Yes—try," repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden
LINE 559: bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at
LINE 560: first, eagerly soon.
LINE 561: "Not too much at first—restrain her," said the brother; "she has had
LINE 562: enough." And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.
LINE 563: "A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes."
LINE 564: "No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her
LINE 565: name."
LINE 566: I felt I could speak, and I answered—"My name is Jane Elliott." Anxious
LINE 567: as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.
LINE 568: "And where do you live? Where are your friends?"
LINE 569: I was silent.
LINE 570: "Can we send for any one you know?"
LINE 571: I shook my head.
LINE 572: "What account can you give of yourself?"
LINE 573: Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and
LINE 574: once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer
LINE 575: outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off
LINE 576: the mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once
LINE 577: more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at
LINE 578: present I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—
LINE 579: "Sir, I can give you no details to-night."
LINE 580: "But what, then," said he, "do you expect me to do for you?"
LINE 581: "Nothing," I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana
LINE 582: took the word—
LINE 583: "Do you mean," she asked, "that we have now given you what aid you
LINE 584: require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?"
LINE 585: I looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct
LINE 586: both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her
LINE 587: compassionate gaze with a smile, I said—"I will trust you. If I were a
LINE 588: masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your
LINE 589: hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for me
LINE 590: as you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I
LINE 591: feel a spasm when I speak." All three surveyed me, and all three were
LINE 592: silent.
LINE 593: "Hannah," said Mr. St. John, at last, "let her sit there at present,
LINE 594: and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder
LINE 595: of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and
LINE 596: talk the matter over."
LINE 597: They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell
LINE 598: which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the
LINE 599: genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere
LINE 600: long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my
LINE 601: dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I
LINE 602: thanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of
LINE 603: grateful joy—and slept.
