LINE 1: I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed
LINE 2: this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to
LINE 3: meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily
LINE 4: expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the
LINE 5: schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had
LINE 6: the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.
LINE 7: But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the
LINE 8: quiet course of Adèle's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard
LINE 9: some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs.
LINE 10: Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's—that is, John's wife—and
LINE 11: even John's own gruff tones. There were exclamations of "What a mercy
LINE 12: master was not burnt in his bed!" "It is always dangerous to keep a
LINE 13: candle lit at night." "How providential that he had presence of mind to
LINE 14: think of the water-jug!" "I wonder he waked nobody!" "It is to be hoped
LINE 15: he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &c.
LINE 16: To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to
LINE 17: rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I
LINE 18: saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete
LINE 19: order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the
LINE 20: window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about
LINE 21: to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the
LINE 22: affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman
LINE 23: sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.
LINE 24: That woman was no other than Grace Poole.
LINE 25: There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff
LINE 26: gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on
LINE 27: her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard
LINE 28: forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the
LINE 29: paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the
LINE 30: countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended
LINE 31: victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),
LINE 32: charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was
LINE 33: amazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,
LINE 34: no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of
LINE 35: guilt, or fear of detection. She said "Good morning, Miss," in her
LINE 36: usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more
LINE 37: tape, went on with her sewing.
LINE 38: "I will put her to some test," thought I: "such absolute
LINE 39: impenetrability is past comprehension."
LINE 40: "Good morning, Grace," I said. "Has anything happened here? I thought I
LINE 41: heard the servants all talking together a while ago."
LINE 42: "Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep
LINE 43: with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he
LINE 44: awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to
LINE 45: quench the flames with the water in the ewer."
LINE 46: "A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her
LINE 47: fixedly—"Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?"
LINE 48: She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of
LINE 49: consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily;
LINE 50: then she answered—
LINE 51: "The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be
LINE 52: likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to
LINE 53: master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get
LINE 54: elderly, they often sleep heavy." She paused, and then added, with a
LINE 55: sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant
LINE 56: tone—"But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper:
LINE 57: perhaps you may have heard a noise?"
LINE 58: "I did," said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still
LINE 59: polishing the panes, could not hear me, "and at first I thought it was
LINE 60: Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a
LINE 61: strange one."
LINE 62: She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her
LINE 63: needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—
LINE 64: "It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he
LINE 65: was in such danger: You must have been dreaming."
LINE 66: "I was not dreaming," I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness
LINE 67: provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and
LINE 68: conscious eye.
LINE 69: "Have you told master that you heard a laugh?" she inquired.
LINE 70: "I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning."
LINE 71: "You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the
LINE 72: gallery?" she further asked.
LINE 73: She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me
LINE 74: information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew
LINE 75: or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant
LINE 76: pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
LINE 77: "On the contrary," said I, "I bolted my door."
LINE 78: "Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before
LINE 79: you get into bed?"
LINE 80: "Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans
LINE 81: accordingly!" Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied
LINE 82: sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not
LINE 83: think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be
LINE 84: dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on
LINE 85: the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture
LINE 86: to lie down."
LINE 87: "It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as
LINE 88: quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by
LINE 89: robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds'
LINE 90: worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for
LINE 91: such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has
LINE 92: never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he
LINE 93: needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe
LINE 94: side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt
LINE 95: between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss,
LINE 96: are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not
LINE 97: dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are
LINE 98: used discreetly." And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her,
LINE 99: and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.
LINE 100: I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her
LINE 101: miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the
LINE 102: cook entered.
LINE 103: "Mrs. Poole," said she, addressing Grace, "the servants' dinner will
LINE 104: soon be ready: will you come down?"
LINE 105: "No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll
LINE 106: carry it upstairs."
LINE 107: "You'll have some meat?"
LINE 108: "Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all."
LINE 109: "And the sago?"
LINE 110: "Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll
LINE 111: make it myself."
LINE 112: The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for
LINE 113: me: so I departed.
LINE 114: I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration
LINE 115: during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the
LINE 116: enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the
LINE 117: problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not
LINE 118: been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed
LINE 119: from her master's service. He had almost as much as declared his
LINE 120: conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause
LINE 121: withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to
LINE 122: secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman
LINE 123: seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so
LINE 124: much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life,
LINE 125: he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her
LINE 126: for it.
LINE 127: Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think
LINE 128: that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester
LINE 129: in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea
LINE 130: could not be admitted. "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once;
LINE 131: her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me
LINE 132: once, she had lived here many years. I don't think she can ever have
LINE 133: been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and
LINE 134: strength of character to compensate for the want of personal
LINE 135: advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:
LINE 136: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very
LINE 137: possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him
LINE 138: into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret
LINE 139: influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake
LINE 140: off, and dare not disregard?" But, having reached this point of
LINE 141: conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even
LINE 142: coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind's eye, that I thought,
LINE 143: "No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet," suggested the
LINE 144: secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, "_you_ are not
LINE 145: beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate,
LINE 146: you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words;
LINE 147: remember his look; remember his voice!"
LINE 148: I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment
LINE 149: vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent
LINE 150: over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.
LINE 151: "Qu'avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she. "Vos doigts tremblent comme la
LINE 152: feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!"
LINE 153: "I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!" She went on sketching; I went on
LINE 154: thinking.
LINE 155: I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been
LINE 156: conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself
LINE 157: with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was
LINE 158: quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much
LINE 159: better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,
LINE 160: more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener
LINE 161: enjoyments.
LINE 162: "Evening approaches," said I, as I looked towards the window. "I have
LINE 163: never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but
LINE 164: surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the
LINE 165: morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled
LINE 166: that it is grown impatient."
LINE 167: When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the
LINE 168: nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the
LINE 169: bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I
LINE 170: fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to
LINE 171: the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut;
LINE 172: darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he
LINE 173: often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
LINE 174: Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many
LINE 175: things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace
LINE 176: Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if
LINE 177: he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous
LINE 178: attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little
LINE 179: mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of
LINE 180: vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in,
LINE 181: and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the
LINE 182: verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked
LINE 183: well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every
LINE 184: propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without
LINE 185: fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.
LINE 186: A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it
LINE 187: was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room. Thither
LINE 188: I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I
LINE 189: imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
LINE 190: "You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate
LINE 191: so little at dinner. I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well
LINE 192: to-day: you look flushed and feverish."
LINE 193: "Oh, quite well! I never felt better."
LINE 194: "Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the
LINE 195: teapot while I knit off this needle?" Having completed her task, she
LINE 196: rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I
LINE 197: suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast
LINE 198: deepening into total obscurity.
LINE 199: "It is fair to-night," said she, as she looked through the panes,
LINE 200: "though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a
LINE 201: favourable day for his journey."
LINE 202: "Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out."
LINE 203: "Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas,
LINE 204: Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe
LINE 205: there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,
LINE 206: Colonel Dent, and others."
LINE 207: "Do you expect him back to-night?"
LINE 208: "No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a
LINE 209: week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they
LINE 210: are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all
LINE 211: that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.
LINE 212: Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr.
LINE 213: Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is
LINE 214: a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would
LINE 215: not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in
LINE 216: their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his
LINE 217: wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look."
LINE 218: "Are there ladies at the Leas?"
LINE 219: "There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young
LINE 220: ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram,
LINE 221: most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or
LINE 222: seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a
LINE 223: Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the
LINE 224: dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit
LINE 225: up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of
LINE 226: the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of
LINE 227: the evening."
LINE 228: "You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?"
LINE 229: "Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was
LINE 230: Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to
LINE 231: hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to
LINE 232: come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw
LINE 233: a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of
LINE 234: them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram
LINE 235: was certainly the queen."
LINE 236: "And what was she like?"
LINE 237: "Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive
LINE 238: complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.
LINE 239: Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then
LINE 240: she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly
LINE 241: arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the
LINE 242: glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an
LINE 243: amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her
LINE 244: breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below
LINE 245: her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it
LINE 246: contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls."
LINE 247: "She was greatly admired, of course?"
LINE 248: "Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.
LINE 249: She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the
LINE 250: piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet."
LINE 251: "Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing."
LINE 252: "Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music."
LINE 253: "And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?"
LINE 254: "A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to
LINE 255: listen to her;—and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but
LINE 256: Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably
LINE 257: good."
LINE 258: "And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?"
LINE 259: "It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large
LINE 260: fortunes. Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the
LINE 261: eldest son came in for everything almost."
LINE 262: "But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to
LINE 263: her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?"
LINE 264: "Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.
LINE 265: Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five."
LINE 266: "What of that? More unequal matches are made every day."
LINE 267: "True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an
LINE 268: idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since
LINE 269: you began tea."
LINE 270: "No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?"
LINE 271: I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.
LINE 272: Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the
LINE 273: conversation was turned into another channel.
LINE 274: When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into
LINE 275: my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring
LINE 276: back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's
LINE 277: boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
LINE 278: Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,
LINE 279: wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the
LINE 280: general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight
LINE 281: past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way, a
LINE 282: plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and
LINE 283: rabidly devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—
LINE 284: That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of
LINE 285: life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet
LINE 286: lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
LINE 287: "_You_," I said, "a favourite with Mr. Rochester? _You_ gifted with the
LINE 288: power of pleasing him? _You_ of importance to him in any way? Go! your
LINE 289: folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens
LINE 290: of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man
LINE 291: of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid
LINE 292: dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to
LINE 293: yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face
LINE 294: and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind
LINE 295: puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed
LINE 296: senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her
LINE 297: superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in
LINE 298: all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned
LINE 299: and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and
LINE 300: responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence
LINE 301: there is no extrication.
LINE 302: "Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass
LINE 303: before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without
LINE 304: softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing
LINE 305: irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected,
LINE 306: poor, and plain.'
LINE 307: "Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your
LINE 308: drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest
LINE 309: tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate
LINE 310: carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest
LINE 311: shades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs.
LINE 312: Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental
LINE 313: eye;—What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no
LINE 314: sentiment!—no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. Recall
LINE 315: the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let
LINE 316: the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit
LINE 317: neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire,
LINE 318: aërial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call
LINE 319: it 'Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.'
LINE 320: "Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks
LINE 321: well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr.
LINE 322: Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to
LINE 323: strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this
LINE 324: indigent and insignificant plebeian?'"
LINE 325: "I'll do it," I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew
LINE 326: calm, and fell asleep.
LINE 327: I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in
LINE 328: crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory
LINE 329: miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face
LINE 330: enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was
LINE 331: as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task:
LINE 332: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and
LINE 333: fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my
LINE 334: heart.
LINE 335: Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of
LINE 336: wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.
LINE 337: Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent
LINE 338: calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been
LINE 339: unequal to maintain, even externally.
