LINE 1: But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring
LINE 2: drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;
LINE 3: its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet,
LINE 4: flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to
LINE 5: heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and
LINE 6: mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood
LINE 7: in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:
LINE 8: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a
LINE 9: greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily,
LINE 10: suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each
LINE 11: morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the
LINE 12: leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed
LINE 13: pansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and
LINE 14: found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
LINE 15: I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the
LINE 16: horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls
LINE 17: of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits
LINE 18: girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright
LINE 19: beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this
LINE 20: scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter,
LINE 21: stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death
LINE 22: wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and
LINE 23: rolled down "ing" and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the
LINE 24: beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore
LINE 25: asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often
LINE 26: thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its
LINE 27: banks, _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons.
LINE 28: April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,
LINE 29: placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its
LINE 30: duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose
LINE 31: its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and
LINE 32: oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up
LINE 33: profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its
LINE 34: hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its
LINE 35: wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed
LINE 36: spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often
LINE 37: and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty
LINE 38: and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to
LINE 39: advert.
LINE 40: Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it
LINE 41: as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
LINE 42: Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another
LINE 43: question.
LINE 44: That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred
LINE 45: pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into
LINE 46: the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and
LINE 47: dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an
LINE 48: hospital.
LINE 49: Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils
LINE 50: to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one
LINE 51: time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well
LINE 52: were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant
LINE 53: insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:
LINE 54: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain
LINE 55: them. Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she
LINE 56: lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours'
LINE 57: rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and
LINE 58: making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls
LINE 59: who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and
LINE 60: willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already
LINE 61: smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were
LINE 62: buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.
LINE 63: While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its
LINE 64: frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;
LINE 65: while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and
LINE 66: the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality,
LINE 67: that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful
LINE 68: woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks
LINE 69: had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were
LINE 70: in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and
LINE 71: crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening,
LINE 72: their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all
LINE 73: useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and
LINE 74: then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
LINE 75: But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of
LINE 76: the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies,
LINE 77: from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we
LINE 78: lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near
LINE 79: Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross
LINE 80: housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her
LINE 81: successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the
LINE 82: ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides,
LINE 83: there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our
LINE 84: breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare
LINE 85: a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece
LINE 86: of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried
LINE 87: away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best,
LINE 88: and dined sumptuously.
LINE 89: My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry
LINE 90: from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading
LINE 91: through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just
LINE 92: broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that
LINE 93: time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant
LINE 94: personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was
LINE 95: witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at
LINE 96: my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could
LINE 97: tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found
LINE 98: gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never
LINE 99: imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative,
LINE 100: I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on
LINE 101: swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much
LINE 102: improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
LINE 103: And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet
LINE 104: days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as
LINE 105: to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I
LINE 106: have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only
LINE 107: tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I
LINE 108: chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was
LINE 109: qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a
LINE 110: taste of far higher things.
LINE 111: True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective
LINE 112: being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of
LINE 113: Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of
LINE 114: attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated
LINE 115: my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under
LINE 116: all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship,
LINE 117: which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen
LINE 118: was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight
LINE 119: to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the
LINE 120: hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her
LINE 121: complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my
LINE 122: ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure
LINE 123: to alleviate.
LINE 124: I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming
LINE 125: downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss
LINE 126: Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to
LINE 127: go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and
LINE 128: then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance
LINE 129: under the verandah.
LINE 130: One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with
LINE 131: Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the
LINE 132: others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to
LINE 133: ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked
LINE 134: after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When
LINE 135: we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the
LINE 136: surgeon's, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she
LINE 137: supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at
LINE 138: that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a
LINE 139: few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in
LINE 140: the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the
LINE 141: morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt
LINE 142: so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so
LINE 143: warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the
LINE 144: morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting
LINE 145: these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my
LINE 146: mind as it had never done before:—
LINE 147: "How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
LINE 148: This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to
LINE 149: have to go who knows where?"
LINE 150: And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had
LINE 151: been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time
LINE 152: it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each
LINE 153: side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the
LINE 154: one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud
LINE 155: and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and
LINE 156: plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the
LINE 157: front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After
LINE 158: she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the
LINE 159: door, but I ran up to her.
LINE 160: "How is Helen Burns?"
LINE 161: "Very poorly," was the answer.
LINE 162: "Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?"
LINE 163: "Yes."
LINE 164: "And what does he say about her?"
LINE 165: "He says she'll not be here long."
LINE 166: This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed
LINE 167: the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her
LINE 168: own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but
LINE 169: I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen
LINE 170: Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going
LINE 171: to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I
LINE 172: experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a
LINE 173: desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.
LINE 174: "She is in Miss Temple's room," said the nurse.
LINE 175: "May I go up and speak to her?"
LINE 176: "Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;
LINE 177: you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling."
LINE 178: The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which
LINE 179: led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and
LINE 180: Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
LINE 181: It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having
LINE 182: been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the
LINE 183: dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose
LINE 184: softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept
LINE 185: from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room. It was
LINE 186: quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light
LINE 187: of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage
LINE 188: windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor
LINE 189: and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I
LINE 190: passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night
LINE 191: should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_
LINE 192: see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last
LINE 193: kiss, exchange with her one last word.
LINE 194: Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below,
LINE 195: and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I
LINE 196: reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just
LINE 197: opposite to me was Miss Temple's room. A light shone through the
LINE 198: keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the
LINE 199: vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to
LINE 200: admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to
LINE 201: hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with
LINE 202: keen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and
LINE 203: feared to find death.
LINE 204: Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains,
LINE 205: there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the
LINE 206: clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken
LINE 207: to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt
LINE 208: dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards
LINE 209: that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I
LINE 210: advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but
LINE 211: I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the
LINE 212: dread of seeing a corpse.
LINE 213: "Helen!" I whispered softly, "are you awake?"
LINE 214: She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,
LINE 215: wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear
LINE 216: was instantly dissipated.
LINE 217: "Can it be you, Jane?" she asked, in her own gentle voice.
LINE 218: "Oh!" I thought, "she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could
LINE 219: not speak and look so calmly if she were."
LINE 220: I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her
LINE 221: cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and wrist; but she
LINE 222: smiled as of old.
LINE 223: "Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it
LINE 224: strike some minutes since."
LINE 225: "I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not
LINE 226: sleep till I had spoken to you."
LINE 227: "You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably."
LINE 228: "Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?"
LINE 229: "Yes; to my long home—my last home."
LINE 230: "No, no, Helen!" I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my
LINE 231: tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the
LINE 232: nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she
LINE 233: whispered—
LINE 234: "Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my
LINE 235: quilt."
LINE 236: I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a
LINE 237: long silence, she resumed, still whispering—
LINE 238: "I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be
LINE 239: sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die
LINE 240: one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is
LINE 241: gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me
LINE 242: much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss
LINE 243: me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not
LINE 244: qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should
LINE 245: have been continually at fault."
LINE 246: "But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?"
LINE 247: "I believe; I have faith: I am going to God."
LINE 248: "Where is God? What is God?"
LINE 249: "My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely
LINE 250: implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count
LINE 251: the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him,
LINE 252: reveal Him to me."
LINE 253: "You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and
LINE 254: that our souls can get to it when we die?"
LINE 255: "I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign
LINE 256: my immortal part to Him without any misgiving. God is my father; God is
LINE 257: my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me."
LINE 258: "And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?"
LINE 259: "You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same
LINE 260: mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane."
LINE 261: Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. "Where is that
LINE 262: region? Does it exist?" And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she
LINE 263: seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I
LINE 264: lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the
LINE 265: sweetest tone—
LINE 266: "How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little;
LINE 267: I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have
LINE 268: you near me."
LINE 269: "I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away."
LINE 270: "Are you warm, darling?"
LINE 271: "Yes."
LINE 272: "Good-night, Jane."
LINE 273: "Good-night, Helen."
LINE 274: She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered.
LINE 275: When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I
LINE 276: was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through
LINE 277: the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my
LINE 278: bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was
LINE 279: afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I
LINE 280: learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had
LINE 281: found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's
LINE 282: shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was—dead.
LINE 283: Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her
LINE 284: death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble
LINE 285: tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word
LINE 286: "Resurgam."
