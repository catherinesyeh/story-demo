LINE 1: Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,
LINE 2: when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and
LINE 3: nearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had
LINE 4: washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just
LINE 5: setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I
LINE 6: was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates
LINE 7: at six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in
LINE 8: the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children
LINE 9: can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.
LINE 10: Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled
LINE 11: milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a
LINE 12: paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse
LINE 13: and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the
LINE 14: nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she said, "Will you go in
LINE 15: and bid Missis good-bye?"
LINE 16: "No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to
LINE 17: supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins
LINE 18: either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best
LINE 19: friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly."
LINE 20: "What did you say, Miss?"
LINE 21: "Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to
LINE 22: the wall."
LINE 23: "That was wrong, Miss Jane."
LINE 24: "It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she
LINE 25: has been my foe."
LINE 26: "O Miss Jane! don't say so!"
LINE 27: "Good-bye to Gateshead!" cried I, as we passed through the hall and
LINE 28: went out at the front door.
LINE 29: The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose
LINE 30: light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw
LINE 31: and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down
LINE 32: the drive. There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it,
LINE 33: we found the porter's wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had
LINE 34: been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It
LINE 35: wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had
LINE 36: struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went
LINE 37: to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
LINE 38: "Is she going by herself?" asked the porter's wife.
LINE 39: "Yes."
LINE 40: "And how far is it?"
LINE 41: "Fifty miles."
LINE 42: "What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far
LINE 43: alone."
LINE 44: The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and
LINE 45: its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged
LINE 46: haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to
LINE 47: which I clung with kisses.
LINE 48: "Be sure and take good care of her," cried she to the guard, as he
LINE 49: lifted me into the inside.
LINE 50: "Ay, ay!" was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed
LINE 51: "All right," and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and
LINE 52: Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote
LINE 53: and mysterious regions.
LINE 54: I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed
LINE 55: to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over
LINE 56: hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one,
LINE 57: a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the
LINE 58: passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard
LINE 59: wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in
LINE 60: an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from
LINE 61: the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled
LINE 62: with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling
LINE 63: very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and
LINE 64: kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having
LINE 65: frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles. At last the guard
LINE 66: returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector
LINE 67: mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over
LINE 68: the "stony street" of L——.
LINE 69: The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I
LINE 70: began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we
LINE 71: ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills
LINE 72: heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a
LINE 73: valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the
LINE 74: prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
LINE 75: Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered
LINE 76: when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,
LINE 77: and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and
LINE 78: dress by the light of the lamps.
LINE 79: "Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?" she asked. I answered
LINE 80: "Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach
LINE 81: instantly drove away.
LINE 82: I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion
LINE 83: of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind,
LINE 84: and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall
LINE 85: before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new
LINE 86: guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house
LINE 87: or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights
LINE 88: burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and
LINE 89: were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into
LINE 90: a room with a fire, where she left me alone.
LINE 91: I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked
LINE 92: round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth
LINE 93: showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany
LINE 94: furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the
LINE 95: drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to
LINE 96: make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened,
LINE 97: and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close
LINE 98: behind.
LINE 99: The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and
LINE 100: large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her
LINE 101: countenance was grave, her bearing erect.
LINE 102: "The child is very young to be sent alone," said she, putting her
LINE 103: candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or
LINE 104: two, then further added—
LINE 105: "She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?"
LINE 106: she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
LINE 107: "A little, ma'am."
LINE 108: "And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to
LINE 109: bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to
LINE 110: come to school, my little girl?"
LINE 111: I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they
LINE 112: had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could
LINE 113: read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with
LINE 114: her forefinger, and saying, "She hoped I should be a good child,"
LINE 115: dismissed me along with Miss Miller.
LINE 116: The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with
LINE 117: me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice,
LINE 118: look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion,
LINE 119: though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one
LINE 120: who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed,
LINE 121: what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I
LINE 122: passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a
LINE 123: large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and
LINE 124: somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had
LINE 125: traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a
LINE 126: wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of
LINE 127: which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a
LINE 128: congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by
LINE 129: the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless,
LINE 130: though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in
LINE 131: brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It
LINE 132: was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their
LINE 133: to-morrow's task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of
LINE 134: their whispered repetitions.
LINE 135: Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking
LINE 136: up to the top of the long room she cried out—
LINE 137: "Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
LINE 138: Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered
LINE 139: the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—
LINE 140: "Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!"
LINE 141: The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray,
LINE 142: with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a
LINE 143: pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were
LINE 144: handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug
LINE 145: being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was
LINE 146: thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering
LINE 147: me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten
LINE 148: cake shared into fragments.
LINE 149: The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed
LINE 150: off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I
LINE 151: scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that,
LINE 152: like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss
LINE 153: Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced
LINE 154: at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two
LINE 155: occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst
LINE 156: silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
LINE 157: The night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once
LINE 158: awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in
LINE 159: torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my
LINE 160: side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls
LINE 161: were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or
LINE 162: two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and
LINE 163: I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a
LINE 164: basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin
LINE 165: to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell
LINE 166: rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the
LINE 167: stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were
LINE 168: read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—
LINE 169: "Form classes!"
LINE 170: A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller
LINE 171: repeatedly exclaimed, "Silence!" and "Order!" When it subsided, I saw
LINE 172: them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at
LINE 173: the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like
LINE 174: a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some
LINE 175: seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss
LINE 176: Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
LINE 177: A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each
LINE 178: walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth
LINE 179: vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the
LINE 180: smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was
LINE 181: called, and placed at the bottom of it.
LINE 182: Business now began: the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts
LINE 183: of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of
LINE 184: chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise
LINE 185: was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now
LINE 186: sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched
LINE 187: into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of
LINE 188: getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having
LINE 189: taken so little the day before.
LINE 190: The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables
LINE 191: smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent
LINE 192: forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of
LINE 193: discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those
LINE 194: destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls
LINE 195: of the first class, rose the whispered words—
LINE 196: "Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!"
LINE 197: "Silence!" ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the
LINE 198: upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of
LINE 199: somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,
LINE 200: while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her
LINE 201: I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller
LINE 202: occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,
LINE 203: foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards
LINE 204: found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was
LINE 205: said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the
LINE 206: teachers, and the meal began.
LINE 207: Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my
LINE 208: portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger
LINE 209: blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge
LINE 210: is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over
LINE 211: it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and
LINE 212: try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.
LINE 213: Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for
LINE 214: what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was
LINE 215: evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in
LINE 216: passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and
LINE 217: taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed
LINE 218: displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—
LINE 219: "Abominable stuff! How shameful!"
LINE 220: A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which
LINE 221: the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it
LINE 222: seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used
LINE 223: their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one
LINE 224: and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they
LINE 225: had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great
LINE 226: girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I
LINE 227: heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which
LINE 228: Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort
LINE 229: to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.
LINE 230: A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and
LINE 231: standing in the middle of the room, cried—
LINE 232: "Silence! To your seats!"
LINE 233: Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved
LINE 234: into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of
LINE 235: tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but
LINE 236: still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the
LINE 237: room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage
LINE 238: they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl
LINE 239: visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker
LINE 240: about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like
LINE 241: a Highlander's purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to
LINE 242: serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings
LINE 243: and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of
LINE 244: those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young
LINE 245: women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the
LINE 246: prettiest.
LINE 247: I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the
LINE 248: teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a
LINE 249: little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh
LINE 250: and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,
LINE 251: weather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to
LINE 252: face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common
LINE 253: spring.
LINE 254: What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I
LINE 255: had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes
LINE 256: were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and
LINE 257: encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at
LINE 258: the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at
LINE 259: each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss
LINE 260: Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received
LINE 261: her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—
LINE 262: "Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!"
LINE 263: While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly
LINE 264: up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I
LINE 265: retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her
LINE 266: steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely;
LINE 267: brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling
LINE 268: of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on
LINE 269: each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in
LINE 270: round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither
LINE 271: smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the
LINE 272: mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish
LINE 273: trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then
LINE 274: as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the
LINE 275: picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately
LINE 276: air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can
LINE 277: give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as
LINE 278: I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to
LINE 279: carry to church.
LINE 280: The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her
LINE 281: seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the
LINE 282: first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the
LINE 283: lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,
LINE 284: grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded,
LINE 285: and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.
LINE 286: The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last
LINE 287: struck twelve. The superintendent rose—
LINE 288: "I have a word to address to the pupils," said she.
LINE 289: The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it
LINE 290: sank at her voice. She went on—
LINE 291: "You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be
LINE 292: hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served
LINE 293: to all."
LINE 294: The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
LINE 295: "It is to be done on my responsibility," she added, in an explanatory
LINE 296: tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
LINE 297: The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the
LINE 298: high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now
LINE 299: given "To the garden!" Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings
LINE 300: of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly
LINE 301: equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.
LINE 302: The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to
LINE 303: exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one
LINE 304: side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of
LINE 305: little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to
LINE 306: cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would
LINE 307: doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was
LINE 308: wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round
LINE 309: me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy,
LINE 310: but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still
LINE 311: soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls
LINE 312: ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones
LINE 313: herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst
LINE 314: these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard
LINE 315: frequently the sound of a hollow cough.
LINE 316: As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of
LINE 317: me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was
LINE 318: accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the
LINE 319: verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the
LINE 320: cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed
LINE 321: me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and
LINE 322: thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit
LINE 323: record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life
LINE 324: seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague
LINE 325: and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked
LINE 326: round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large
LINE 327: building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new.
LINE 328: The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by
LINE 329: mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a
LINE 330: stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:—
LINE 331: LOWOOD INSTITUTION.
LINE 332: This portion was rebuilt A.D. ——, by Naomi Brocklehurst,
LINE 333: of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.
LINE 334: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,
LINE 335: and glorify your Father which is in heaven."—St. Matt. v. 16.
LINE 336: I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation
LINE 337: belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was
LINE 338: still pondering the signification of "Institution," and endeavouring to
LINE 339: make out a connection between the first words and the verse of
LINE 340: Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my
LINE 341: head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a
LINE 342: book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I
LINE 343: could see the title—it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as
LINE 344: strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to
LINE 345: look up, and I said to her directly—
LINE 346: "Is your book interesting?" I had already formed the intention of
LINE 347: asking her to lend it to me some day.
LINE 348: "I like it," she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during
LINE 349: which she examined me.
LINE 350: "What is it about?" I continued. I hardly know where I found the
LINE 351: hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was
LINE 352: contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a
LINE 353: chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a
LINE 354: frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the
LINE 355: serious or substantial.
LINE 356: "You may look at it," replied the girl, offering me the book.
LINE 357: I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less
LINE 358: taking than the title: "Rasselas" looked dull to my trifling taste; I
LINE 359: saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety
LINE 360: seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she
LINE 361: received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to
LINE 362: relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—
LINE 363: "Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?
LINE 364: What is Lowood Institution?"
LINE 365: "This house where you are come to live."
LINE 366: "And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from
LINE 367: other schools?"
LINE 368: "It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are
LINE 369: charity-children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your
LINE 370: father or your mother dead?"
LINE 371: "Both died before I can remember."
LINE 372: "Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and
LINE 373: this is called an institution for educating orphans."
LINE 374: "Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?"
LINE 375: "We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each."
LINE 376: "Then why do they call us charity-children?"
LINE 377: "Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the
LINE 378: deficiency is supplied by subscription."
LINE 379: "Who subscribes?"
LINE 380: "Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood
LINE 381: and in London."
LINE 382: "Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?"
LINE 383: "The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records,
LINE 384: and whose son overlooks and directs everything here."
LINE 385: "Why?"
LINE 386: "Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment."
LINE 387: "Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch,
LINE 388: and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?"
LINE 389: "To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr.
LINE 390: Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and
LINE 391: all our clothes."
LINE 392: "Does he live here?"
LINE 393: "No—two miles off, at a large hall."
LINE 394: "Is he a good man?"
LINE 395: "He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good."
LINE 396: "Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?"
LINE 397: "Yes."
LINE 398: "And what are the other teachers called?"
LINE 399: "The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work,
LINE 400: and cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and
LINE 401: everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she
LINE 402: teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions;
LINE 403: and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to
LINE 404: her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from
LINE 405: Lisle, in France, and teaches French."
LINE 406: "Do you like the teachers?"
LINE 407: "Well enough."
LINE 408: "Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ——?—I cannot
LINE 409: pronounce her name as you do."
LINE 410: "Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to offend her; Madame
LINE 411: Pierrot is not a bad sort of person."
LINE 412: "But Miss Temple is the best—isn't she?"
LINE 413: "Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest,
LINE 414: because she knows far more than they do."
LINE 415: "Have you been long here?"
LINE 416: "Two years."
LINE 417: "Are you an orphan?"
LINE 418: "My mother is dead."
LINE 419: "Are you happy here?"
LINE 420: "You ask rather too many questions. I have given you answers enough for
LINE 421: the present: now I want to read."
LINE 422: But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the
LINE 423: house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more
LINE 424: appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the
LINE 425: dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong
LINE 426: steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of
LINE 427: indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked
LINE 428: together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was
LINE 429: apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within
LINE 430: myself whether every day's fare would be like this.
LINE 431: After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons
LINE 432: recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock.
LINE 433: The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with
LINE 434: whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss
LINE 435: Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the
LINE 436: large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree
LINE 437: ignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or
LINE 438: upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame;
LINE 439: but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though
LINE 440: grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. "How can she bear it so
LINE 441: quietly—so firmly?" I asked of myself. "Were I in her place, it seems
LINE 442: to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as
LINE 443: if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her
LINE 444: situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of
LINE 445: day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor,
LINE 446: but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down
LINE 447: into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not
LINE 448: at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether
LINE 449: good or naughty."
LINE 450: Soon after five P.M. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of
LINE 451: coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank
LINE 452: my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I
LINE 453: was still hungry. Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then
LINE 454: the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such
LINE 455: was my first day at Lowood.
