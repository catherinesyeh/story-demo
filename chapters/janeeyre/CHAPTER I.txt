LINE 1: There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been
LINE 2: wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;
LINE 3: but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)
LINE 4: the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain
LINE 5: so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the
LINE 6: question.
LINE 7: I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly
LINE 8: afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,
LINE 9: with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of
LINE 10: Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical
LINE 11: inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
LINE 12: The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama
LINE 13: in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and
LINE 14: with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor
LINE 15: crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the
LINE 16: group; saying, "She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me
LINE 17: at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover
LINE 18: by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to
LINE 19: acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive
LINE 20: and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it
LINE 21: were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for
LINE 22: contented, happy, little children."
LINE 23: "What does Bessie say I have done?" I asked.
LINE 24: "Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is
LINE 25: something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that
LINE 26: manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain
LINE 27: silent."
LINE 28: A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It
LINE 29: contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care
LINE 30: that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the
LINE 31: window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk;
LINE 32: and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in
LINE 33: double retirement.
LINE 34: Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left
LINE 35: were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from
LINE 36: the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of
LINE 37: my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it
LINE 38: offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and
LINE 39: storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a
LINE 40: long and lamentable blast.
LINE 41: I returned to my book—Bewick's History of British Birds: the
LINE 42: letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet
LINE 43: there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not
LINE 44: pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of
LINE 45: sea-fowl; of "the solitary rocks and promontories" by them only
LINE 46: inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern
LINE 47: extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—
LINE 48: "Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,
LINE 49: Boils round the naked, melancholy isles
LINE 50: Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge
LINE 51: Pours in among the stormy Hebrides."
LINE 52: Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of
LINE 53: Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with
LINE 54: "the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary
LINE 55: space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the
LINE 56: accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above
LINE 57: heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of
LINE 58: extreme cold." Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own:
LINE 59: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through
LINE 60: children's brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these
LINE 61: introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,
LINE 62: and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow
LINE 63: and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold
LINE 64: and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just
LINE 65: sinking.
LINE 66: I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,
LINE 67: with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,
LINE 68: girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the
LINE 69: hour of eventide.
LINE 70: The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine
LINE 71: phantoms.
LINE 72: The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him, I passed over
LINE 73: quickly: it was an object of terror.
LINE 74: So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a
LINE 75: distant crowd surrounding a gallows.
LINE 76: Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped
LINE 77: understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:
LINE 78: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter
LINE 79: evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having
LINE 80: brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit
LINE 81: about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her
LINE 82: nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and
LINE 83: adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a
LINE 84: later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of
LINE 85: Moreland.
LINE 86: With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I
LINE 87: feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The
LINE 88: breakfast-room door opened.
LINE 89: "Boh! Madam Mope!" cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he
LINE 90: found the room apparently empty.
LINE 91: "Where the dickens is she!" he continued. "Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to
LINE 92: his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the
LINE 93: rain—bad animal!"
LINE 94: "It is well I drew the curtain," thought I; and I wished fervently he
LINE 95: might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it
LINE 96: out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza
LINE 97: just put her head in at the door, and said at once—
LINE 98: "She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack."
LINE 99: And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged
LINE 100: forth by the said Jack.
LINE 101: "What do you want?" I asked, with awkward diffidence.
LINE 102: "Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'" was the answer. "I want you to
LINE 103: come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a
LINE 104: gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
LINE 105: John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than
LINE 106: I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and
LINE 107: unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs
LINE 108: and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which
LINE 109: made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.
LINE 110: He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home
LINE 111: for a month or two, "on account of his delicate health." Mr. Miles, the
LINE 112: master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and
LINE 113: sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother's heart turned from an
LINE 114: opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that
LINE 115: John's sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining
LINE 116: after home.
LINE 117: John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an
LINE 118: antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in
LINE 119: the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I
LINE 120: had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he
LINE 121: came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he
LINE 122: inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces
LINE 123: or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young
LINE 124: master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf
LINE 125: on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though
LINE 126: he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently,
LINE 127: however, behind her back.
LINE 128: Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some
LINE 129: three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could
LINE 130: without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while
LINE 131: dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him
LINE 132: who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my
LINE 133: face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and
LINE 134: strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a
LINE 135: step or two from his chair.
LINE 136: "That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since," said he,
LINE 137: "and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look
LINE 138: you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!"
LINE 139: Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;
LINE 140: my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the
LINE 141: insult.
LINE 142: "What were you doing behind the curtain?" he asked.
LINE 143: "I was reading."
LINE 144: "Show the book."
LINE 145: I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
LINE 146: "You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama
LINE 147: says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg,
LINE 148: and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the
LINE 149: same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense. Now, I'll
LINE 150: teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house
LINE 151: belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out
LINE 152: of the way of the mirror and the windows."
LINE 153: I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him
LINE 154: lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively
LINE 155: started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume
LINE 156: was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and
LINE 157: cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its
LINE 158: climax; other feelings succeeded.
LINE 159: "Wicked and cruel boy!" I said. "You are like a murderer—you are like a
LINE 160: slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!"
LINE 161: I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of
LINE 162: Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I
LINE 163: never thought thus to have declared aloud.
LINE 164: "What! what!" he cried. "Did she say that to me? Did you hear her,
LINE 165: Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first—"
LINE 166: He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had
LINE 167: closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a
LINE 168: murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my
LINE 169: neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations
LINE 170: for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic
LINE 171: sort. I don't very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me
LINE 172: "Rat! Rat!" and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and
LINE 173: Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came
LINE 174: upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:
LINE 175: I heard the words—
LINE 176: "Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!"
LINE 177: "Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!"
LINE 178: Then Mrs. Reed subjoined—
LINE 179: "Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there." Four hands were
LINE 180: immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.
