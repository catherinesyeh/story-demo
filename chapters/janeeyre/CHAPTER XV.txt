LINE 1: Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one
LINE 2: afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adèle in the grounds: and
LINE 3: while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up
LINE 4: and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
LINE 5: He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Céline
LINE 6: Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a "_grande
LINE 7: passion_." This passion Céline had professed to return with even
LINE 8: superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he
LINE 9: believed, as he said, that she preferred his "_taille d'athlète_" to
LINE 10: the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
LINE 11: "And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the
LINE 12: Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel;
LINE 13: gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres,
LINE 14: diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining
LINE 15: myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it
LINE 16: seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and
LINE 17: destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to
LINE 18: deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the
LINE 19: fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Céline
LINE 20: did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was
LINE 21: tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy
LINE 22: to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,—I
LINE 23: exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about
LINE 24: her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of
LINE 25: musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to
LINE 26: stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences,
LINE 27: when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the
LINE 28: balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and
LINE 29: serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and
LINE 30: took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me."
LINE 31: Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a
LINE 32: cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah
LINE 33: incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on—
LINE 34: "I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was
LINE 35: _croquant_—(overlook the barbarism)—_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and
LINE 36: smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along
LINE 37: the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in
LINE 38: an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses,
LINE 39: and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the
LINE 40: 'voiture' I had given Céline. She was returning: of course my heart
LINE 41: thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. The
LINE 42: carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that
LINE 43: is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a
LINE 44: cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June
LINE 45: evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the
LINE 46: skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over
LINE 47: the balcony, I was about to murmur 'Mon ange'—in a tone, of course,
LINE 48: which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped
LINE 49: from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel
LINE 50: which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now
LINE 51: passed under the arched _porte cochère_ of the hotel.
LINE 52: "You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not
LINE 53: ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to
LINE 54: experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall
LINE 55: waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in
LINE 56: which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes
LINE 57: and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in
LINE 58: the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I
LINE 59: tell you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy
LINE 60: pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up
LINE 61: into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to
LINE 62: atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave
LINE 63: into a calmer current—as I am now.
LINE 64: "I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and
LINE 65: stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its
LINE 66: antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey
LINE 67: façade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet
LINE 68: how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a
LINE 69: great plague-house? How I do still abhor—"
LINE 70: He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step and struck his
LINE 71: boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in
LINE 72: its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.
LINE 73: We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before
LINE 74: us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such
LINE 75: as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust,
LINE 76: detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the
LINE 77: large pupil dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which
LINE 78: should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something
LINE 79: hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and
LINE 80: petrified his countenance: he went on—
LINE 81: "During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point
LINE 82: with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of
LINE 83: those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. 'You like
LINE 84: Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the
LINE 85: air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the
LINE 86: house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if
LINE 87: you can! Like it if you dare!'
LINE 88: "'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined
LINE 89: moodily) "I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to
LINE 90: goodness—yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been,
LINE 91: than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the
LINE 92: habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will
LINE 93: esteem but straw and rotten wood."
LINE 94: Adèle here ran before him with her shuttlecock. "Away!" he cried
LINE 95: harshly; "keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!" Continuing
LINE 96: then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the
LINE 97: point whence he had abruptly diverged—
LINE 98: "Did you leave the balcony, sir," I asked, "when Mdlle. Varens
LINE 99: entered?"
LINE 100: I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on
LINE 101: the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his
LINE 102: eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. "Oh, I had
LINE 103: forgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in
LINE 104: accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake
LINE 105: of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony,
LINE 106: glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my
LINE 107: heart's core. Strange!" he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the
LINE 108: point. "Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this,
LINE 109: young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if
LINE 110: it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell
LINE 111: stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like
LINE 112: you! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once
LINE 113: before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made
LINE 114: to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I
LINE 115: have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable
LINE 116: to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I
LINE 117: do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.
LINE 118: The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you,
LINE 119: you may refresh me." After this digression he proceeded—
LINE 120: "I remained in the balcony. 'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,'
LINE 121: thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.' So putting my hand in through
LINE 122: the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening
LINE 123: through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement,
LINE 124: all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers'
LINE 125: whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the
LINE 126: pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline's chamber-maid
LINE 127: entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple
LINE 128: were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there
LINE 129: was 'the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and
LINE 130: there was her companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a
LINE 131: young roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had
LINE 132: sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I
LINE 133: despised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake
LINE 134: Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for
LINE 135: Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such
LINE 136: a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less,
LINE 137: however, than I, who had been her dupe.
LINE 138: "They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,
LINE 139: mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary
LINE 140: than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being
LINE 141: perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed
LINE 142: energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely
LINE 143: as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed
LINE 144: rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.
LINE 145: Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of
LINE 146: what she called my '_beauté mâle_:' wherein she differed diametrically
LINE 147: from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you
LINE 148: did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—"
LINE 149: Adèle here came running up again.
LINE 150: "Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and
LINE 151: wishes to see you."
LINE 152: "Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon
LINE 153: them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate
LINE 154: her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded
LINE 155: screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an
LINE 156: appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.
LINE 157: Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in
LINE 158: one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the
LINE 159: pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the
LINE 160: Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she
LINE 161: affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no
LINE 162: proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more
LINE 163: like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she
LINE 164: abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I
LINE 165: acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle's part to be supported by me,
LINE 166: nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that
LINE 167: she was quite destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime
LINE 168: and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the
LINE 169: wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to
LINE 170: train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a
LINE 171: French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and
LINE 172: protégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have
LINE 173: found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,
LINE 174: &c.—Eh?"
LINE 175: "No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I
LINE 176: have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,
LINE 177: parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall
LINE 178: cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt
LINE 179: pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to
LINE 180: a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?"
LINE 181: "Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now;
LINE 182: and you too: it darkens."
LINE 183: But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race
LINE 184: with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went
LINE 185: in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept
LINE 186: her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking
LINE 187: even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to
LINE 188: stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of
LINE 189: character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an
LINE 190: English mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to
LINE 191: appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her
LINE 192: countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none:
LINE 193: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity:
LINE 194: if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have
LINE 195: thought more of her.
LINE 196: It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,
LINE 197: that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had
LINE 198: said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance
LINE 199: of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French
LINE 200: dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no
LINE 201: doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the
LINE 202: paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the
LINE 203: act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly
LINE 204: revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated
LINE 205: wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it
LINE 206: for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my
LINE 207: master's manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose
LINE 208: in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as
LINE 209: such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards
LINE 210: me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits
LINE 211: of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed
LINE 212: welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when
LINE 213: summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a
LINE 214: cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power
LINE 215: to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much
LINE 216: for his pleasure as for my benefit.
LINE 217: I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with
LINE 218: relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a
LINE 219: mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do
LINE 220: not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their
LINE 221: interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange
LINE 222: novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in
LINE 223: receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he
LINE 224: portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he
LINE 225: disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
LINE 226: The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly
LINE 227: frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to
LINE 228: him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:
LINE 229: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it
LINE 230: was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest
LINE 231: added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin
LINE 232: crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled
LINE 233: up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
LINE 234: And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and
LINE 235: many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object
LINE 236: I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the
LINE 237: brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could
LINE 238: not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic,
LINE 239: harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew
LINE 240: that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many
LINE 241: others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when
LINE 242: sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with
LINE 243: his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,
LINE 244: almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that
LINE 245: his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say
LINE 246: _former_, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some
LINE 247: cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better
LINE 248: tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as
LINE 249: circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny
LINE 250: encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for
LINE 251: the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot
LINE 252: deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have
LINE 253: given much to assuage it.
LINE 254: Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I
LINE 255: could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,
LINE 256: and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be
LINE 257: happy at Thornfield.
LINE 258: "Why not?" I asked myself. "What alienates him from the house? Will he
LINE 259: leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer
LINE 260: than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.
LINE 261: If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be absent
LINE 262: spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will
LINE 263: seem!"
LINE 264: I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any
LINE 265: rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and
LINE 266: lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had
LINE 267: kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were
LINE 268: depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.
LINE 269: I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward
LINE 270: tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.
LINE 271: Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had
LINE 272: swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I
LINE 273: said, "Who is there?" Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.
LINE 274: All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the
LINE 275: kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up
LINE 276: to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there
LINE 277: myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.
LINE 278: Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again
LINE 279: through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it
LINE 280: was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely
LINE 281: approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing
LINE 282: incident enough.
LINE 283: This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it
LINE 284: seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was
LINE 285: near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my
LINE 286: bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and
LINE 287: could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was
LINE 288: reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse
LINE 289: was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, "Who is
LINE 290: there?"
LINE 291: Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery
LINE 292: towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut
LINE 293: in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
LINE 294: "Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?" thought I.
LINE 295: Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I
LINE 296: hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the
LINE 297: door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside,
LINE 298: and on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this
LINE 299: circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite
LINE 300: dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and
LINE 301: left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware
LINE 302: of a strong smell of burning.
LINE 303: Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.
LINE 304: Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no
LINE 305: more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh:
LINE 306: in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round
LINE 307: the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour,
LINE 308: Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
LINE 309: "Wake! wake!" I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:
LINE 310: the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very
LINE 311: sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one
LINE 312: was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved
LINE 313: them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,
LINE 314: brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid,
LINE 315: succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
LINE 316: The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I
LINE 317: flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of
LINE 318: the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
LINE 319: Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him
LINE 320: fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of
LINE 321: water.
LINE 322: "Is there a flood?" he cried.
LINE 323: "No, sir," I answered; "but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are
LINE 324: quenched now; I will fetch you a candle."
LINE 325: "In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?" he
LINE 326: demanded. "What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the
LINE 327: room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?"
LINE 328: "I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.
LINE 329: Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and
LINE 330: what it is."
LINE 331: "There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two
LINE 332: minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes,
LINE 333: here is my dressing-gown. Now run!"
LINE 334: I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He
LINE 335: took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened
LINE 336: and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
LINE 337: "What is it? and who did it?" he asked.
LINE 338: I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had
LINE 339: heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the
LINE 340: smoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what
LINE 341: state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the
LINE 342: water I could lay hands on.
LINE 343: "What is it and who did it?" he asked
LINE 344: He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more
LINE 345: concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had
LINE 346: concluded.
LINE 347: "Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?" I asked.
LINE 348: "Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she
LINE 349: do? Let her sleep unmolested."
LINE 350: "Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife."
LINE 351: "Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm
LINE 352: enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down
LINE 353: in the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the
LINE 354: stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few
LINE 355: minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return;
LINE 356: be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second storey. Don't
LINE 357: move, remember, or call any one."
LINE 358: He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very
LINE 359: softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,
LINE 360: shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total
LINE 361: darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long
LINE 362: time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and
LINE 363: then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.
LINE 364: I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying
LINE 365: his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,
LINE 366: and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. "I hope it is he,"
LINE 367: thought I, "and not something worse."
LINE 368: He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. "I have found it all out," said
LINE 369: he, setting his candle down on the washstand; "it is as I thought."
LINE 370: "How, sir?"
LINE 371: He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the
LINE 372: ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar
LINE 373: tone—
LINE 374: "I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your
LINE 375: chamber door."
LINE 376: "No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground."
LINE 377: "But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should
LINE 378: think, or something like it?"
LINE 379: "Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she
LINE 380: laughs in that way. She is a singular person."
LINE 381: "Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say,
LINE 382: singular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am
LINE 383: glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the
LINE 384: precise details of to-night's incident. You are no talking fool: say
LINE 385: nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs" (pointing
LINE 386: to the bed): "and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on
LINE 387: the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four:—in
LINE 388: two hours the servants will be up."
LINE 389: "Good-night, then, sir," said I, departing.
LINE 390: He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to
LINE 391: go.
LINE 392: "What!" he exclaimed, "are you quitting me already, and in that way?"
LINE 393: "You said I might go, sir."
LINE 394: "But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of
LINE 395: acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry
LINE 396: fashion. Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and
LINE 397: excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual
LINE 398: strangers! At least shake hands."
LINE 399: He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, then in
LINE 400: both his own.
LINE 401: "You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a
LINE 402: debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been
LINE 403: tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation:
LINE 404: but you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane."
LINE 405: He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,—but
LINE 406: his voice was checked.
LINE 407: "Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation,
LINE 408: in the case."
LINE 409: "I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some
LINE 410: time;—I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression
LINE 411: and smile did not"—(again he stopped)—"did not" (he proceeded hastily)
LINE 412: "strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of
LINE 413: natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of
LINE 414: truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!"
LINE 415: Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look.
LINE 416: "I am glad I happened to be awake," I said: and then I was going.
LINE 417: "What! you _will_ go?"
LINE 418: "I am cold, sir."
LINE 419: "Cold? Yes,—and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!" But he still
LINE 420: retained my hand, and I could not free it. I bethought myself of an
LINE 421: expedient.
LINE 422: "I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir," said I.
LINE 423: "Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
LINE 424: I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I
LINE 425: was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble
LINE 426: rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild
LINE 427: waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a
LINE 428: freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards
LINE 429: the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy—a counteracting
LINE 430: breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist
LINE 431: delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as
LINE 432: soon as day dawned.
