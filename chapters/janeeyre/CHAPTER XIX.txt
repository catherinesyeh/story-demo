LINE 1: The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl—if
LINE 2: Sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the
LINE 3: chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a
LINE 4: broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under
LINE 5: her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending
LINE 6: over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a
LINE 7: prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to
LINE 8: herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist
LINE 9: immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a
LINE 10: paragraph.
LINE 11: I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with
LINE 12: sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as
LINE 13: composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the
LINE 14: gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm. She shut her book and slowly
LINE 15: looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as
LINE 16: she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and
LINE 17: black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed
LINE 18: under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye
LINE 19: confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.
LINE 20: "Well, and you want your fortune told?" she said, in a voice as decided
LINE 21: as her glance, as harsh as her features.
LINE 22: "I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to
LINE 23: warn you, I have no faith."
LINE 24: "It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it
LINE 25: in your step as you crossed the threshold."
LINE 26: "Did you? You've a quick ear."
LINE 27: "I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain."
LINE 28: "You need them all in your trade."
LINE 29: "I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with. Why don't
LINE 30: you tremble?"
LINE 31: "I'm not cold."
LINE 32: "Why don't you turn pale?"
LINE 33: "I am not sick."
LINE 34: "Why don't you consult my art?"
LINE 35: "I'm not silly."
LINE 36: The old crone "nichered" a laugh under her bonnet and bandage; she then
LINE 37: drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having
LINE 38: indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the
LINE 39: pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very
LINE 40: deliberately—
LINE 41: "You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly."
LINE 42: "Prove it," I rejoined.
LINE 43: "I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact
LINE 44: strikes the fire from you that is in you. You are sick; because the
LINE 45: best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far
LINE 46: away from you. You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not
LINE 47: beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it
LINE 48: waits you."
LINE 49: She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking
LINE 50: with vigour.
LINE 51: "You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a
LINE 52: solitary dependent in a great house."
LINE 53: "I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any
LINE 54: one?"
LINE 55: "In my circumstances."
LINE 56: "Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely
LINE 57: placed as you are."
LINE 58: "It would be easy to find you thousands."
LINE 59: "You could scarcely find me one. If you knew it, you are peculiarly
LINE 60: situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it. The materials
LINE 61: are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them. Chance
LINE 62: laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss
LINE 63: results."
LINE 64: "I don't understand enigmas. I never could guess a riddle in my life."
LINE 65: "If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm."
LINE 66: "And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?"
LINE 67: "To be sure."
LINE 68: I gave her a shilling: she put it into an old stocking-foot which she
LINE 69: took out of her pocket, and having tied it round and returned it, she
LINE 70: told me to hold out my hand. I did. She approached her face to the
LINE 71: palm, and pored over it without touching it.
LINE 72: "It is too fine," said she. "I can make nothing of such a hand as that;
LINE 73: almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm? Destiny is not
LINE 74: written there."
LINE 75: "I believe you," said I.
LINE 76: "No," she continued, "it is in the face: on the forehead, about the
LINE 77: eyes, in the lines of the mouth. Kneel, and lift up your head."
LINE 78: "Ah! now you are coming to reality," I said, as I obeyed her. "I shall
LINE 79: begin to put some faith in you presently."
LINE 80: I knelt within half a yard of her. She stirred the fire, so that a
LINE 81: ripple of light broke from the disturbed coal: the glare, however, as
LINE 82: she sat, only threw her face into deeper shadow: mine, it illumined.
LINE 83: "I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night," she said, when
LINE 84: she had examined me a while. "I wonder what thoughts are busy in your
LINE 85: heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people
LINE 86: flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little
LINE 87: sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were
LINE 88: really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance."
LINE 89: "I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad."
LINE 90: "Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with
LINE 91: whispers of the future?"
LINE 92: "Not I. The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings
LINE 93: to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself."
LINE 94: "A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that
LINE 95: window-seat (you see I know your habits)—"
LINE 96: "You have learned them from the servants."
LINE 97: "Ah! you think yourself sharp. Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I
LINE 98: have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole—"
LINE 99: I started to my feet when I heard the name.
LINE 100: "You have—have you?" thought I; "there is diablerie in the business
LINE 101: after all, then!"
LINE 102: "Don't be alarmed," continued the strange being; "she's a safe hand is
LINE 103: Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her. But,
LINE 104: as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing
LINE 105: but your future school? Have you no present interest in any of the
LINE 106: company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you? Is there not one
LINE 107: face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least
LINE 108: curiosity?"
LINE 109: "I like to observe all the faces and all the figures."
LINE 110: "But do you never single one from the rest—or it may be, two?"
LINE 111: "I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a
LINE 112: tale: it amuses me to watch them."
LINE 113: "What tale do you like best to hear?"
LINE 114: "Oh, I have not much choice! They generally run on the same
LINE 115: theme—courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe—marriage."
LINE 116: "And do you like that monotonous theme?"
LINE 117: "Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me."
LINE 118: "Nothing to you? When a lady, young and full of life and health,
LINE 119: charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune,
LINE 120: sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you—"
LINE 121: "I what?"
LINE 122: "You know—and perhaps think well of."
LINE 123: "I don't know the gentlemen here. I have scarcely interchanged a
LINE 124: syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider
LINE 125: some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young,
LINE 126: dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to
LINE 127: be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling
LINE 128: disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
LINE 129: "You don't know the gentlemen here? You have not exchanged a syllable
LINE 130: with one of them? Will you say that of the master of the house!"
LINE 131: "He is not at home."
LINE 132: "A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this
LINE 133: morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that
LINE 134: circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance—blot him,
LINE 135: as it were, out of existence?"
LINE 136: "No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme
LINE 137: you had introduced."
LINE 138: "I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late
LINE 139: so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they
LINE 140: overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked
LINE 141: that?"
LINE 142: "Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests."
LINE 143: "No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all
LINE 144: the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured
LINE 145: with the most lively and the most continuous?"
LINE 146: "The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator." I said
LINE 147: this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice,
LINE 148: manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream. One unexpected
LINE 149: sentence came from her lips after another, till I got involved in a web
LINE 150: of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for
LINE 151: weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every
LINE 152: pulse.
LINE 153: "Eagerness of a listener!" repeated she: "yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by
LINE 154: the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such
LINE 155: delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so
LINE 156: willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him;
LINE 157: you have noticed this?"
LINE 158: "Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face."
LINE 159: "Detecting! You have analysed, then. And what did you detect, if not
LINE 160: gratitude?"
LINE 161: I said nothing.
LINE 162: "You have seen love: have you not?—and, looking forward, you have seen
LINE 163: him married, and beheld his bride happy?"
LINE 164: "Humph! Not exactly. Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes."
LINE 165: "What the devil have you seen, then?"
LINE 166: "Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that
LINE 167: Mr. Rochester is to be married?"
LINE 168: "Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram."
LINE 169: "Shortly?"
LINE 170: "Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with
LINE 171: an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it),
LINE 172: they will be a superlatively happy pair. He must love such a handsome,
LINE 173: noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not
LINE 174: his person, at least his purse. I know she considers the Rochester
LINE 175: estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her
LINE 176: something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous
LINE 177: grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch. I would advise her
LINE 178: blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or
LINE 179: clearer rent-roll,—he's dished—"
LINE 180: "But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to
LINE 181: hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it."
LINE 182: "Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait
LINE 183: contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that
LINE 184: I know. I knew it before I came here this evening. She has laid it
LINE 185: carefully on one side for you. I saw her do it. It depends on yourself
LINE 186: to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so,
LINE 187: is the problem I study. Kneel again on the rug."
LINE 188: "Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me."
LINE 189: She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her chair
LINE 190: I knelt. She did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in
LINE 191: her chair. She began muttering,—
LINE 192: "The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft
LINE 193: and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible;
LINE 194: impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases
LINE 195: to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that
LINE 196: signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it
LINE 197: will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking
LINE 198: glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,—to disown the
LINE 199: charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only
LINE 200: confirm me in my opinion. The eye is favourable.
LINE 201: "As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to
LINE 202: impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be
LINE 203: silent on much the heart experiences. Mobile and flexible, it was never
LINE 204: intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a
LINE 205: mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection
LINE 206: for its interlocutor. That feature too is propitious.
LINE 207: "I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow
LINE 208: professes to say,—'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances
LINE 209: require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an
LINE 210: inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous
LINE 211: delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford
LINE 212: to give.' The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins,
LINE 213: and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild
LINE 214: chasms. The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they
LINE 215: are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment
LINE 216: shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote
LINE 217: in every decision. Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by:
LINE 218: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which
LINE 219: interprets the dictates of conscience.'
LINE 220: "Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I have
LINE 221: formed my plans—right plans I deem them—and in them I have attended to
LINE 222: the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason. I know how soon youth
LINE 223: would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one
LINE 224: dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not
LINE 225: want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution—such is not my taste. I wish to
LINE 226: foster, not to blight—to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of
LINE 227: blood—no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments,
LINE 228: in sweet—That will do. I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.
LINE 229: I should wish now to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare
LINE 230: not. So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I
LINE 231: inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my
LINE 232: strength. Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; 'the play is played out.'"
LINE 233: Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming? Did I dream
LINE 234: still? The old woman's voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and
LINE 235: all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass—as the speech of my
LINE 236: own tongue. I got up, but did not go. I looked; I stirred the fire, and
LINE 237: I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about
LINE 238: her face, and again beckoned me to depart. The flame illuminated her
LINE 239: hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at
LINE 240: once noticed that hand. It was no more the withered limb of eld than my
LINE 241: own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically
LINE 242: turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping
LINE 243: forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times
LINE 244: before. Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from
LINE 245: me—on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the
LINE 246: head advanced.
LINE 247: "Well, Jane, do you know me?" asked the familiar voice.
LINE 248: "Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—"
LINE 249: "But the string is in a knot—help me."
LINE 250: "Break it, sir."
LINE 251: "There, then—'Off, ye lendings!'" And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his
LINE 252: disguise.
LINE 253: "Now, sir, what a strange idea!"
LINE 254: "But well carried out, eh? Don't you think so?"
LINE 255: "With the ladies you must have managed well."
LINE 256: "But not with you?"
LINE 257: "You did not act the character of a gipsy with me."
LINE 258: "What character did I act? My own?"
LINE 259: "No; some unaccountable one. In short, I believe you have been trying
LINE 260: to draw me out—or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk
LINE 261: nonsense. It is scarcely fair, sir."
LINE 262: "Do you forgive me, Jane?"
LINE 263: "I cannot tell till I have thought it all over. If, on reflection, I
LINE 264: find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you;
LINE 265: but it was not right."
LINE 266: "Oh, you have been very correct—very careful, very sensible."
LINE 267: I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but,
LINE 268: indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the
LINE 269: interview. Something of masquerade I suspected. I knew gipsies and
LINE 270: fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman
LINE 271: had expressed herself; besides I had noted her feigned voice, her
LINE 272: anxiety to conceal her features. But my mind had been running on Grace
LINE 273: Poole—that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered
LINE 274: her. I had never thought of Mr. Rochester.
LINE 275: "Well," said he, "what are you musing about? What does that grave smile
LINE 276: signify?"
LINE 277: "Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire
LINE 278: now, I suppose?"
LINE 279: "No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room
LINE 280: yonder are doing."
LINE 281: "Discussing the gipsy, I daresay."
LINE 282: "Sit down!—Let me hear what they said about me."
LINE 283: "I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock. Oh,
LINE 284: are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since
LINE 285: you left this morning?"
LINE 286: "A stranger!—no; who can it be? I expected no one; is he gone?"
LINE 287: "No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty
LINE 288: of installing himself here till you returned."
LINE 289: "The devil he did! Did he give his name?"
LINE 290: "His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from
LINE 291: Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think."
LINE 292: Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he had taken my hand, as if to lead
LINE 293: me to a chair. As I spoke he gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile
LINE 294: on his lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his breath.
LINE 295: "Mason!—the West Indies!" he said, in the tone one might fancy a
LINE 296: speaking automaton to enounce its single words; "Mason!—the West
LINE 297: Indies!" he reiterated; and he went over the syllables three times,
LINE 298: growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he hardly
LINE 299: seemed to know what he was doing.
LINE 300: "Do you feel ill, sir?" I inquired.
LINE 301: "Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!" He staggered.
LINE 302: "Oh, lean on me, sir."
LINE 303: "Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now."
LINE 304: "Yes, sir, yes; and my arm."
LINE 305: He sat down, and made me sit beside him. Holding my hand in both his
LINE 306: own, he chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most
LINE 307: troubled and dreary look.
LINE 308: "My little friend!" said he, "I wish I were in a quiet island with only
LINE 309: you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from
LINE 310: me."
LINE 311: "Can I help you, sir?—I'd give my life to serve you."
LINE 312: "Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you
LINE 313: that."
LINE 314: "Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,—I'll try, at least, to do it."
LINE 315: "Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be
LINE 316: at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is
LINE 317: doing."
LINE 318: I went. I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr.
LINE 319: Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,—the supper was
LINE 320: arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he chose, and they stood
LINE 321: about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their
LINE 322: hands. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were
LINE 323: general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel
LINE 324: and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them. I filled a
LINE 325: wine-glass (I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she
LINE 326: thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay), and I returned to the
LINE 327: library.
LINE 328: Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he looked once more
LINE 329: firm and stern. He took the glass from my hand.
LINE 330: "Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said. He swallowed the
LINE 331: contents and returned it to me. "What are they doing, Jane?"
LINE 332: "Laughing and talking, sir."
LINE 333: "They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something
LINE 334: strange?"
LINE 335: "Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety."
LINE 336: "And Mason?"
LINE 337: "He was laughing too."
LINE 338: "If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do,
LINE 339: Jane?"
LINE 340: "Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could."
LINE 341: He half smiled. "But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at
LINE 342: me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then
LINE 343: dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?"
LINE 344: "I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with
LINE 345: you."
LINE 346: "To comfort me?"
LINE 347: "Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could."
LINE 348: "And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?"
LINE 349: "I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I
LINE 350: should care nothing about it."
LINE 351: "Then, you could dare censure for my sake?"
LINE 352: "I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence;
LINE 353: as you, I am sure, do."
LINE 354: "Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in
LINE 355: his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in
LINE 356: here and then leave me."
LINE 357: "Yes, sir."
LINE 358: I did his behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight
LINE 359: among them. I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him
LINE 360: from the room: I ushered him into the library, and then I went
LINE 361: upstairs.
LINE 362: At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors
LINE 363: repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and
LINE 364: heard him say, "This way, Mason; this is your room."
LINE 365: He spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease. I was soon
LINE 366: asleep.
