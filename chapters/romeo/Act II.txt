LINE 1: ACT II. Scene I.
LINE 2: A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
LINE 3: Enter Romeo alone.
LINE 4: Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
LINE 5: Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
LINE 6: [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
LINE 7: Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
LINE 8: Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
LINE 9: Mer. He is wise,
LINE 10: And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
LINE 11: Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
LINE 12: Call, good Mercutio.
LINE 13: Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
LINE 14: Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
LINE 15: Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
LINE 16: Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
LINE 17: Cry but 'Ah me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
LINE 18: Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
LINE 19: One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
LINE 20: Young auburn Cupid, he that shot so trim
LINE 21: When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
LINE 22: He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
LINE 23: The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
LINE 24: I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
LINE 25: By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
LINE 26: By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
LINE 27: And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
LINE 28: That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
LINE 29: Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
LINE 30: Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
LINE 31: To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
LINE 32: Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
LINE 33: Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
LINE 34: That were some spite; my invocation
LINE 35: Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
LINE 36: I conjure only but to raise up him.
LINE 37: Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
LINE 38: To be consorted with the humorous night.
LINE 39: Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
LINE 40: Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
LINE 41: Now will he sit under a medlar tree
LINE 42: And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
LINE 43: As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
LINE 44: O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
LINE 45: An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
LINE 46: Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
LINE 47: This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
LINE 48: Come, shall we go?
LINE 49: Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
LINE 50: 'To seek him here that means not to be found.
LINE 51: Exeunt.
LINE 52: Scene II.
LINE 53: Capulet's orchard.
LINE 54: Enter Romeo.
LINE 55: Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
LINE 56: Enter Juliet above at a window.
LINE 57: But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
LINE 58: It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
LINE 59: Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
LINE 60: Who is already sick and pale with grief
LINE 61: That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
LINE 62: Be not her maid, since she is envious.
LINE 63: Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
LINE 64: And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
LINE 65: It is my lady; O, it is my love!
LINE 66: O that she knew she were!
LINE 67: She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
LINE 68: Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
LINE 69: I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
LINE 70: Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
LINE 71: Having some business, do entreat her eyes
LINE 72: To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
LINE 73: What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
LINE 74: The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
LINE 75: As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
LINE 76: Would through the airy region stream so bright
LINE 77: That birds would sing and think it were not night.
LINE 78: See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
LINE 79: O that I were a glove upon that hand,
LINE 80: That I might touch that cheek!
LINE 81: Jul. Ah me!
LINE 82: Rom. She speaks.
LINE 83: O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
LINE 84: As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
LINE 85: As is a winged messenger of heaven
LINE 86: Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
LINE 87: Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
LINE 88: When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
LINE 89: And sails upon the bosom of the air.
LINE 90: Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
LINE 91: Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
LINE 92: Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
LINE 93: And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
LINE 94: Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
LINE 95: Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
LINE 96: Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
LINE 97: What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
LINE 98: Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
LINE 99: Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
LINE 100: What's in a name? That which we call a rose
LINE 101: By any other name would smell as sweet.
LINE 102: So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
LINE 103: Retain that dear perfection which he owes
LINE 104: Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
LINE 105: And for that name, which is no part of thee,
LINE 106: Take all myself.
LINE 107: Rom. I take thee at thy word.
LINE 108: Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
LINE 109: Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
LINE 110: Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
LINE 111: So stumblest on my counsel?
LINE 112: Rom. By a name
LINE 113: I know not how to tell thee who I am.
LINE 114: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
LINE 115: Because it is an enemy to thee.
LINE 116: Had I it written, I would tear the word.
LINE 117: Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
LINE 118: Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
LINE 119: Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
LINE 120: Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
LINE 121: Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
LINE 122: The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
LINE 123: And the place death, considering who thou art,
LINE 124: If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
LINE 125: Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
LINE 126: For stony limits cannot hold love out,
LINE 127: And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
LINE 128: Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
LINE 129: Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
LINE 130: Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
LINE 131: Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
LINE 132: And I am proof against their enmity.
LINE 133: Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
LINE 134: Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
LINE 135: And but thou love me, let them find me here.
LINE 136: My life were better ended by their hate
LINE 137: Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
LINE 138: Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
LINE 139: Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
LINE 140: He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
LINE 141: I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
LINE 142: As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
LINE 143: I would adventure for such merchandise.
LINE 144: Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
LINE 145: Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
LINE 146: For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
LINE 147: Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
LINE 148: What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
LINE 149: Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
LINE 150: And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
LINE 151: Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
LINE 152: They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
LINE 153: If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
LINE 154: Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
LINE 155: I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
LINE 156: So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
LINE 157: In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
LINE 158: And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
LINE 159: But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
LINE 160: Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
LINE 161: I should have been more strange, I must confess,
LINE 162: But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
LINE 163: My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
LINE 164: And not impute this yielding to light love,
LINE 165: Which the dark night hath so discovered.
LINE 166: Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
LINE 167: That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
LINE 168: Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
LINE 169: That monthly changes in her circled orb,
LINE 170: Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
LINE 171: Rom. What shall I swear by?
LINE 172: Jul. Do not swear at all;
LINE 173: Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
LINE 174: Which is the god of my idolatry,
LINE 175: And I'll believe thee.
LINE 176: Rom. If my heart's dear love-
LINE 177: Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
LINE 178: I have no joy of this contract to-night.
LINE 179: It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
LINE 180: Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
LINE 181: Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
LINE 182: This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
LINE 183: May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
LINE 184: Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
LINE 185: Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
LINE 186: Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
LINE 187: Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
LINE 188: Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
LINE 189: Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
LINE 190: And yet I would it were to give again.
LINE 191: Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
LINE 192: Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
LINE 193: And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
LINE 194: My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
LINE 195: My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
LINE 196: The more I have, for both are infinite.
LINE 197: I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
LINE 198: [Nurse] calls within.
LINE 199: Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
LINE 200: Stay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.]
LINE 201: Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
LINE 202: Being in night, all this is but a dream,
LINE 203: Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
LINE 204: Enter Juliet above.
LINE 205: Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
LINE 206: If that thy bent of love be honourable,
LINE 207: Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
LINE 208: By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
LINE 209: Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
LINE 210: And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
LINE 211: And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
LINE 212: Nurse. (within) Madam!
LINE 213: Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
LINE 214: I do beseech thee-
LINE 215: Nurse. (within) Madam!
LINE 216: Jul. By-and-by I come.-
LINE 217: To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
LINE 218: To-morrow will I send.
LINE 219: Rom. So thrive my soul-
LINE 220: Jul. A thousand times good night! Exit.
LINE 221: Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
LINE 222: Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
LINE 223: But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
LINE 224: Enter Juliet again, [above].
LINE 225: Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
LINE 226: To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
LINE 227: Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
LINE 228: Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
LINE 229: And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
LINE 230: With repetition of my Romeo's name.
LINE 231: Romeo!
LINE 232: Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
LINE 233: How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
LINE 234: Like softest music to attending ears!
LINE 235: Jul. Romeo!
LINE 236: Rom. My dear?
LINE 237: Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
LINE 238: Shall I send to thee?
LINE 239: Rom. By the hour of nine.
LINE 240: Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
LINE 241: I have forgot why I did call thee back.
LINE 242: Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
LINE 243: Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
LINE 244: Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
LINE 245: Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
LINE 246: Forgetting any other home but this.
LINE 247: Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
LINE 248: And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
LINE 249: That lets it hop a little from her hand,
LINE 250: Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
LINE 251: And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
LINE 252: So loving-jealous of his liberty.
LINE 253: Rom. I would I were thy bird.
LINE 254: Jul. Sweet, so would I.
LINE 255: Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
LINE 256: Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
LINE 257: That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
LINE 258: [Exit.]
LINE 259: Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
LINE 260: Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
LINE 261: Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
LINE 262: His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
LINE 263: Exit
LINE 264: Scene III.
LINE 265: Friar Laurence's cell.
LINE 266: Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
LINE 267: Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
LINE 268: Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
LINE 269: And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
LINE 270: From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
LINE 271: Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
LINE 272: The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
LINE 273: I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
LINE 274: With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
LINE 275: The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
LINE 276: What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
LINE 277: And from her womb children of divers kind
LINE 278: We sucking on her natural bosom find;
LINE 279: Many for many virtues excellent,
LINE 280: None but for some, and yet all different.
LINE 281: O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
LINE 282: In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
LINE 283: For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
LINE 284: But to the earth some special good doth give;
LINE 285: Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
LINE 286: Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
LINE 287: Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
LINE 288: And vice sometime's by action dignified.
LINE 289: Within the infant rind of this small flower
LINE 290: Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
LINE 291: For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
LINE 292: Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
LINE 293: Two such opposed kings encamp them still
LINE 294: In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
LINE 295: And where the worser is predominant,
LINE 296: Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
LINE 297: Enter Romeo.
LINE 298: Rom. Good morrow, father.
LINE 299: Friar. Benedicite!
LINE 300: What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
LINE 301: Young son, it argues a distempered head
LINE 302: So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
LINE 303: Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
LINE 304: And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
LINE 305: But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
LINE 306: Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
LINE 307: Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
LINE 308: Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
LINE 309: Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
LINE 310: Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
LINE 311: Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
LINE 312: Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
LINE 313: Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
LINE 314: I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
LINE 315: Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
LINE 316: Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
LINE 317: I have been feasting with mine enemy,
LINE 318: Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
LINE 319: That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
LINE 320: Within thy help and holy physic lies.
LINE 321: I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
LINE 322: My intercession likewise steads my foe.
LINE 323: Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
LINE 324: Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
LINE 325: Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
LINE 326: On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
LINE 327: As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
LINE 328: And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
LINE 329: By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
LINE 330: We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
LINE 331: I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
LINE 332: That thou consent to marry us to-day.
LINE 333: Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
LINE 334: Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
LINE 335: So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
LINE 336: Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
LINE 337: Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
LINE 338: Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
LINE 339: How much salt water thrown away in waste,
LINE 340: To season love, that of it doth not taste!
LINE 341: The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
LINE 342: Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
LINE 343: Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
LINE 344: Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
LINE 345: If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
LINE 346: Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
LINE 347: And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
LINE 348: Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
LINE 349: Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
LINE 350: Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
LINE 351: Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
LINE 352: Friar. Not in a grave
LINE 353: To lay one in, another out to have.
LINE 354: Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
LINE 355: Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
LINE 356: The other did not so.
LINE 357: Friar. O, she knew well
LINE 358: Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
LINE 359: But come, young waverer, come go with me.
LINE 360: In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
LINE 361: For this alliance may so happy prove
LINE 362: To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
LINE 363: Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
LINE 364: Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
LINE 365: Exeunt.
LINE 366: Scene IV.
LINE 367: A street.
LINE 368: Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
LINE 369: Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
LINE 370: Came he not home to-night?
LINE 371: Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
LINE 372: Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
LINE 373: Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
LINE 374: Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
LINE 375: Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
LINE 376: Mer. A challenge, on my life.
LINE 377: Ben. Romeo will answer it.
LINE 378: Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
LINE 379: Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
LINE 380: being
LINE 381: dared.
LINE 382: Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
LINE 383: wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
LINE 384: very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
LINE 385: butt-shaft;
LINE 386: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
LINE 387: Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
LINE 388: Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
LINE 389: courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
LINE 390: pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
LINE 391: minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
LINE 392: butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
LINE 393: of
LINE 394: the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
LINE 395: immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
LINE 396: Ben. The what?
LINE 397: Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
LINE 398: these
LINE 399: new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
LINE 400: tall
LINE 401: man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
LINE 402: grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
LINE 403: flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
LINE 404: so
LINE 405: much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
LINE 406: bench? O, their bones, their bones!
LINE 407: Enter Romeo.
LINE 408: Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
LINE 409: Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
LINE 410: art
LINE 411: thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
LINE 412: flowed
LINE 413: in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
LINE 414: had a
LINE 415: better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
LINE 416: Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or
LINE 417: so,
LINE 418: but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a
LINE 419: French
LINE 420: salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
LINE 421: fairly last night.
LINE 422: Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
LINE 423: Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
LINE 424: Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such
LINE 425: a
LINE 426: case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
LINE 427: Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains
LINE 428: a
LINE 429: man to bow in the hams.
LINE 430: Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
LINE 431: Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
LINE 432: Rom. A most courteous exposition.
LINE 433: Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
LINE 434: Rom. Pink for flower.
LINE 435: Mer. Right.
LINE 436: Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
LINE 437: Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
LINE 438: thy
LINE 439: pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
LINE 440: remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
LINE 441: Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
LINE 442: Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
LINE 443: Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
LINE 444: Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
LINE 445: thou
LINE 446: hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
LINE 447: sure, I
LINE 448: have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
LINE 449: Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
LINE 450: there
LINE 451: for the goose.
LINE 452: Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
LINE 453: Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
LINE 454: Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp
LINE 455: sauce.
LINE 456: Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
LINE 457: Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
LINE 458: narrow to an ell broad!
LINE 459: Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
LINE 460: the
LINE 461: goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
LINE 462: Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
LINE 463: art
LINE 464: thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou
LINE 465: art, by
LINE 466: art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
LINE 467: great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his
LINE 468: bauble in
LINE 469: a hole.
LINE 470: Ben. Stop there, stop there!
LINE 471: Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
LINE 472: Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
LINE 473: Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
LINE 474: was
LINE 475: come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
LINE 476: occupy
LINE 477: the argument no longer.
LINE 478: Rom. Here's goodly gear!
LINE 479: Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
LINE 480: Mer. A sail, a sail!
LINE 481: Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
LINE 482: Nurse. Peter!
LINE 483: Peter. Anon.
LINE 484: Nurse. My fan, Peter.
LINE 485: Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer
LINE 486: face of
LINE 487: the two.
LINE 488: Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
LINE 489: Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
LINE 490: Nurse. Is it good-den?
LINE 491: Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
LINE 492: now
LINE 493: upon the prick of noon.
LINE 494: Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
LINE 495: Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
LINE 496: Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
LINE 497: quoth
LINE 498: 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
LINE 499: young
LINE 500: Romeo?
LINE 501: Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
LINE 502: have
LINE 503: found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
LINE 504: of
LINE 505: that name, for fault of a worse.
LINE 506: Nurse. You say well.
LINE 507: Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
LINE 508: wisely.
LINE 509: Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
LINE 510: Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
LINE 511: Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
LINE 512: Rom. What hast thou found?
LINE 513: Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
LINE 514: something stale and hoar ere it be spent
LINE 515: He walks by them and sings.
LINE 516: An old hare hoar,
LINE 517: And an old hare hoar,
LINE 518: Is very good meat in Lent;
LINE 519: But a hare that is hoar
LINE 520: Is too much for a score
LINE 521: When it hoars ere it be spent.
LINE 522: Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner
LINE 523: thither.
LINE 524: Rom. I will follow you.
LINE 525: Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
LINE 526: [sings] lady, lady, lady.
LINE 527: Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
LINE 528: Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
LINE 529: was
LINE 530: this that was so full of his ropery?
LINE 531: Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
LINE 532: will
LINE 533: speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
LINE 534: Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
LINE 535: 'a
LINE 536: were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I
LINE 537: cannot,
LINE 538: I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
LINE 539: flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
LINE 540: stand
LINE 541: by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
LINE 542: Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
LINE 543: weapon
LINE 544: should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
LINE 545: soon
LINE 546: as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
LINE 547: law
LINE 548: on my side.
LINE 549: Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
LINE 550: quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told
LINE 551: you,
LINE 552: my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
LINE 553: will
LINE 554: keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
LINE 555: her
LINE 556: into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
LINE 557: kind of
LINE 558: behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
LINE 559: therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
LINE 560: an
LINE 561: ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak
LINE 562: dealing.
LINE 563: Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
LINE 564: thee-
LINE 565: Nurse. Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
LINE 566: Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
LINE 567: Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
LINE 568: Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
LINE 569: take
LINE 570: it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
LINE 571: Rom. Bid her devise
LINE 572: Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
LINE 573: And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
LINE 574: Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
LINE 575: Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
LINE 576: Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
LINE 577: Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
LINE 578: Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
LINE 579: Within this hour my man shall be with thee
LINE 580: And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
LINE 581: Which to the high topgallant of my joy
LINE 582: Must be my convoy in the secret night.
LINE 583: Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
LINE 584: Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
LINE 585: Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
LINE 586: Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
LINE 587: Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
LINE 588: Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
LINE 589: Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
LINE 590: Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
LINE 591: when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
LINE 592: town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
LINE 593: good
LINE 594: soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
LINE 595: anger
LINE 596: her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
LINE 597: but
LINE 598: I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
LINE 599: clout
LINE 600: in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
LINE 601: with
LINE 602: a letter?
LINE 603: Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
LINE 604: Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
LINE 605: know
LINE 606: it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
LINE 607: sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
LINE 608: good
LINE 609: to hear it.
LINE 610: Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
LINE 611: Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
LINE 612: Peter. Anon.
LINE 613: Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
LINE 614: Exeunt.
LINE 615: Scene V.
LINE 616: Capulet's orchard.
LINE 617: Enter Juliet.
LINE 618: Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
LINE 619: In half an hour she promis'd to return.
LINE 620: Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
LINE 621: O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
LINE 622: Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
LINE 623: Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
LINE 624: Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
LINE 625: And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
LINE 626: Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
LINE 627: Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
LINE 628: Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
LINE 629: Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
LINE 630: She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
LINE 631: My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
LINE 632: And his to me,
LINE 633: But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
LINE 634: Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
LINE 635: Enter Nurse [and Peter].
LINE 636: O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
LINE 637: Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
LINE 638: Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
LINE 639: [Exit Peter.]
LINE 640: Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
LINE 641: Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
LINE 642: If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
LINE 643: By playing it to me with so sour a face.
LINE 644: Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
LINE 645: Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
LINE 646: Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
LINE 647: Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
LINE 648: Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
LINE 649: Do you not see that I am out of breath?
LINE 650: Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
LINE 651: To say to me that thou art out of breath?
LINE 652: The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
LINE 653: Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
LINE 654: Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
LINE 655: Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
LINE 656: Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
LINE 657: Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
LINE 658: choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
LINE 659: than
LINE 660: any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
LINE 661: foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
LINE 662: they
LINE 663: are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
LINE 664: warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
LINE 665: God.
LINE 666: What, have you din'd at home?
LINE 667: Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
LINE 668: What says he of our marriage? What of that?
LINE 669: Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
LINE 670: It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
LINE 671: My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
LINE 672: Beshrew your heart for sending me about
LINE 673: To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
LINE 674: Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
LINE 675: Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
LINE 676: Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
LINE 677: courteous,
LINE 678: and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
LINE 679: is
LINE 680: your mother?
LINE 681: Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
LINE 682: Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
LINE 683: 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
LINE 684: "Where is your mother?"'
LINE 685: Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
LINE 686: Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
LINE 687: Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
LINE 688: Henceforward do your messages yourself.
LINE 689: Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
LINE 690: Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
LINE 691: Jul. I have.
LINE 692: Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
LINE 693: There stays a husband to make you a wife.
LINE 694: Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
LINE 695: They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
LINE 696: Hie you to church; I must another way,
LINE 697: To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
LINE 698: Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
LINE 699: I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
LINE 700: But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
LINE 701: Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
LINE 702: Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
LINE 703: Exeunt.
LINE 704: Scene VI.
LINE 705: Friar Laurence's cell.
LINE 706: Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
LINE 707: Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
LINE 708: That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
LINE 709: Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
LINE 710: It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
LINE 711: That one short minute gives me in her sight.
LINE 712: Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
LINE 713: Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
LINE 714: It is enough I may but call her mine.
LINE 715: Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
LINE 716: And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
LINE 717: Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
LINE 718: Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
LINE 719: And in the taste confounds the appetite.
LINE 720: Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
LINE 721: Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
LINE 722: Enter Juliet.
LINE 723: Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
LINE 724: Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
LINE 725: A lover may bestride the gossamer
LINE 726: That idles in the wanton summer air,
LINE 727: And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
LINE 728: Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
LINE 729: Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
LINE 730: Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
LINE 731: Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
LINE 732: Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
LINE 733: To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
LINE 734: This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
LINE 735: Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
LINE 736: Receive in either by this dear encounter.
LINE 737: Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
LINE 738: Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
LINE 739: They are but beggars that can count their worth;
LINE 740: But my true love is grown to such excess
LINE 741: cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
LINE 742: Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
LINE 743: For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
LINE 744: Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
LINE 745: [Exeunt.]
