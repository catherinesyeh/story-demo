LINE 1: ACT I. Scene I.
LINE 2: Verona. A public place.
LINE 3: Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
LINE 4: of Capulet.
LINE 5: Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
LINE 6: Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
LINE 7: Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
LINE 8: Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
LINE 9: Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
LINE 10: Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
LINE 11: Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
LINE 12: Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
LINE 13: Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
LINE 14: Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
LINE 15: the
LINE 16: wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
LINE 17: Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
LINE 18: wall.
LINE 19: Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
LINE 20: are
LINE 21: ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
LINE 22: from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
LINE 23: Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
LINE 24: Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
LINE 25: fought
LINE 26: with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
LINE 27: their heads.
LINE 28: Greg. The heads of the maids?
LINE 29: Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
LINE 30: Take it in what sense thou wilt.
LINE 31: Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
LINE 32: Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis
LINE 33: known I
LINE 34: am a pretty piece of flesh.
LINE 35: Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
LINE 36: been
LINE 37: poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
LINE 38: Montagues.
LINE 39: Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
LINE 40: Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
LINE 41: Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
LINE 42: Samp. Fear me not.
LINE 43: Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
LINE 44: Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
LINE 45: Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they
LINE 46: list.
LINE 47: Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
LINE 48: disgrace to them, if they bear it.
LINE 49: Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
LINE 50: Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
LINE 51: Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
LINE 52: Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
LINE 53: Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.
LINE 54: Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite
LINE 55: my
LINE 56: thumb, sir.
LINE 57: Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
LINE 58: Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
LINE 59: Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
LINE 60: you.
LINE 61: Abr. No better.
LINE 62: Samp. Well, sir.
LINE 63: Enter Benvolio.
LINE 64: Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
LINE 65: master's kinsmen.
LINE 66: Samp. Yes, better, sir.
LINE 67: Abr. You lie.
LINE 68: Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
LINE 69: They fight.
LINE 70: Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
LINE 71: Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
LINE 72: Enter Tybalt.
LINE 73: Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
LINE 74: Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
LINE 75: Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
LINE 76: Or manage it to part these men with me.
LINE 77: Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
LINE 78: As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
LINE 79: Have at thee, coward! They fight.
LINE 80: Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
LINE 81: partisans.
LINE 82: Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
LINE 83: Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
LINE 84: Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
LINE 85: Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
LINE 86: Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
LINE 87: Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
LINE 88: And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
LINE 89: Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
LINE 90: Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
LINE 91: M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
LINE 92: Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
LINE 93: Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
LINE 94: Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
LINE 95: Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
LINE 96: That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
LINE 97: With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
LINE 98: On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
LINE 99: Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
LINE 100: And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
LINE 101: Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
LINE 102: By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
LINE 103: Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
LINE 104: And made Verona's ancient citizens
LINE 105: Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
LINE 106: To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
LINE 107: Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
LINE 108: If ever you disturb our streets again,
LINE 109: Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
LINE 110: For this time all the rest depart away.
LINE 111: You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
LINE 112: And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
LINE 113: To know our farther pleasure in this case,
LINE 114: To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
LINE 115: Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
LINE 116: Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
LINE 117: Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
LINE 118: Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
LINE 119: Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
LINE 120: And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
LINE 121: I drew to part them. In the instant came
LINE 122: The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
LINE 123: Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
LINE 124: He swung about his head and cut the winds,
LINE 125: Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
LINE 126: While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
LINE 127: Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
LINE 128: Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
LINE 129: M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
LINE 130: Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
LINE 131: Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
LINE 132: Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
LINE 133: A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
LINE 134: Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
LINE 135: That westward rooteth from the city's side,
LINE 136: So early walking did I see your son.
LINE 137: Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
LINE 138: And stole into the covert of the wood.
LINE 139: I- measuring his affections by my own,
LINE 140: Which then most sought where most might not be found,
LINE 141: Being one too many by my weary self-
LINE 142: Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
LINE 143: And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
LINE 144: Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
LINE 145: With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
LINE 146: Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
LINE 147: But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
LINE 148: Should in the farthest East bean to draw
LINE 149: The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
LINE 150: Away from light steals home my heavy son
LINE 151: And private in his chamber pens himself,
LINE 152: Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
LINE 153: And makes himself an artificial night.
LINE 154: Black and portentous must this humour prove
LINE 155: Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
LINE 156: Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
LINE 157: Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him.
LINE 158: Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
LINE 159: Mon. Both by myself and many other friends;
LINE 160: But he, his own affections' counsellor,
LINE 161: Is to himself- I will not say how true-
LINE 162: But to himself so secret and so close,
LINE 163: So far from sounding and discovery,
LINE 164: As is the bud bit with an envious worm
LINE 165: Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
LINE 166: Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
LINE 167: Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
LINE 168: We would as willingly give cure as know.
LINE 169: Enter Romeo.
LINE 170: Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
LINE 171: I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
LINE 172: Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
LINE 173: To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
LINE 174: Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
LINE 175: Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
LINE 176: Rom. Is the day so young?
LINE 177: Ben. But new struck nine.
LINE 178: Rom. Ah me! sad hours seem long.
LINE 179: Was that my father that went hence so fast?
LINE 180: Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
LINE 181: Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
LINE 182: Ben. In love?
LINE 183: Rom. Out-
LINE 184: Ben. Of love?
LINE 185: Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
LINE 186: Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
LINE 187: Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
LINE 188: Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
LINE 189: Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
LINE 190: Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
LINE 191: Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
LINE 192: Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
LINE 193: Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
LINE 194: O anything, of nothing first create!
LINE 195: O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
LINE 196: Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
LINE 197: Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
LINE 198: Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
LINE 199: This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
LINE 200: Dost thou not laugh?
LINE 201: Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
LINE 202: Rom. Good heart, at what?
LINE 203: Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
LINE 204: Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
LINE 205: Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
LINE 206: Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
LINE 207: With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
LINE 208: Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
LINE 209: Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
LINE 210: Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
LINE 211: Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
LINE 212: What is it else? A madness most discreet,
LINE 213: A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
LINE 214: Farewell, my coz.
LINE 215: Ben. Soft! I will go along.
LINE 216: An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
LINE 217: Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
LINE 218: This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
LINE 219: Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
LINE 220: Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
LINE 221: Ben. Groan? Why, no;
LINE 222: But sadly tell me who.
LINE 223: Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
LINE 224: Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
LINE 225: In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
LINE 226: Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
LINE 227: Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
LINE 228: Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
LINE 229: Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
LINE 230: With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
LINE 231: And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
LINE 232: From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
LINE 233: She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
LINE 234: Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
LINE 235: Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
LINE 236: O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
LINE 237: That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
LINE 238: Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
LINE 239: Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
LINE 240: For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
LINE 241: Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
LINE 242: She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
LINE 243: To merit bliss by making me despair.
LINE 244: She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
LINE 245: Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
LINE 246: Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
LINE 247: Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
LINE 248: Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
LINE 249: Examine other beauties.
LINE 250: Rom. 'Tis the way
LINE 251: To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
LINE 252: These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
LINE 253: Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
LINE 254: He that is strucken blind cannot forget
LINE 255: The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
LINE 256: Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
LINE 257: What doth her beauty serve but as a note
LINE 258: Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
LINE 259: Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
LINE 260: Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Exeunt.
LINE 261: Scene II.
LINE 262: A Street.
LINE 263: Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
LINE 264: Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
LINE 265: In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
LINE 266: For men so old as we to keep the peace.
LINE 267: Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
LINE 268: And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
LINE 269: But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
LINE 270: Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
LINE 271: My child is yet a stranger in the world,
LINE 272: She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
LINE 273: Let two more summers wither in their pride
LINE 274: Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
LINE 275: Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
LINE 276: Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
LINE 277: The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
LINE 278: She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
LINE 279: But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
LINE 280: My will to her consent is but a part.
LINE 281: An she agree, within her scope of choice
LINE 282: Lies my consent and fair according voice.
LINE 283: This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
LINE 284: Whereto I have invited many a guest,
LINE 285: Such as I love; and you among the store,
LINE 286: One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
LINE 287: At my poor house look to behold this night
LINE 288: Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
LINE 289: Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
LINE 290: When well apparell'd April on the heel
LINE 291: Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
LINE 292: Among fresh female buds shall you this night
LINE 293: Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
LINE 294: And like her most whose merit most shall be;
LINE 295: Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
LINE 296: May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
LINE 297: Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
LINE 298: sirrah,
LINE 299: trudge about
LINE 300: Through fair Verona; find those persons out
LINE 301: Whose names are written there, and to them say,
LINE 302: My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
LINE 303: Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
LINE 304: Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
LINE 305: that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
LINE 306: with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
LINE 307: with
LINE 308: his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
LINE 309: here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
LINE 310: hath
LINE 311: here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
LINE 312: Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
LINE 313: Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
LINE 314: One pain is lessened by another's anguish;
LINE 315: Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
LINE 316: One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
LINE 317: Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
LINE 318: And the rank poison of the old will die.
LINE 319: Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
LINE 320: Ben. For what, I pray thee?
LINE 321: Rom. For your broken shin.
LINE 322: Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
LINE 323: Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
LINE 324: Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
LINE 325: Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
LINE 326: Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
LINE 327: Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
LINE 328: Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
LINE 329: you
LINE 330: read anything you see?
LINE 331: Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
LINE 332: Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
LINE 333: Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read. He reads.
LINE 334: 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
LINE 335: County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
LINE 336: The lady widow of Vitruvio;
LINE 337: Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
LINE 338: Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
LINE 339: Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
LINE 340: My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
LINE 341: Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
LINE 342: Lucio and the lively Helena.'
LINE 343: [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
LINE 344: come?
LINE 345: Serv. Up.
LINE 346: Rom. Whither?
LINE 347: Serv. To supper, to our house.
LINE 348: Rom. Whose house?
LINE 349: Serv. My master's.
LINE 350: Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
LINE 351: Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
LINE 352: rich
LINE 353: Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
LINE 354: come
LINE 355: and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry! Exit.
LINE 356: Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
LINE 357: Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
LINE 358: With all the admired beauties of Verona.
LINE 359: Go thither, and with unattainted eye
LINE 360: Compare her face with some that I shall show,
LINE 361: And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
LINE 362: Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
LINE 363: Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
LINE 364: And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
LINE 365: Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
LINE 366: One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
LINE 367: Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
LINE 368: Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
LINE 369: Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
LINE 370: But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
LINE 371: Your lady's love against some other maid
LINE 372: That I will show you shining at this feast,
LINE 373: And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
LINE 374: Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
LINE 375: But to rejoice in splendour of my own. [Exeunt.]
LINE 376: Scene III.
LINE 377: Capulet's house.
LINE 378: Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
LINE 379: Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
LINE 380: Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
LINE 381: I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
LINE 382: God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
LINE 383: Enter Juliet.
LINE 384: Jul. How now? Who calls?
LINE 385: Nurse. Your mother.
LINE 386: Jul. Madam, I am here.
LINE 387: What is your will?
LINE 388: Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
LINE 389: We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
LINE 390: I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
LINE 391: Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
LINE 392: Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
LINE 393: Wife. She's not fourteen.
LINE 394: Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
LINE 395: And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
LINE 396: She is not fourteen. How long is it now
LINE 397: To Lammastide?
LINE 398: Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
LINE 399: Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
LINE 400: Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
LINE 401: Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
LINE 402: Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
LINE 403: She was too good for me. But, as I said,
LINE 404: On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
LINE 405: That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
LINE 406: 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
LINE 407: And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
LINE 408: Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
LINE 409: For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
LINE 410: Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
LINE 411: My lord and you were then at Mantua.
LINE 412: Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
LINE 413: When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
LINE 414: Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
LINE 415: To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
LINE 416: Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
LINE 417: To bid me trudge.
LINE 418: And since that time it is eleven years,
LINE 419: For then she could stand alone; nay, by th' rood,
LINE 420: She could have run and waddled all about;
LINE 421: For even the day before, she broke her brow;
LINE 422: And then my husband (God be with his soul!
LINE 423: 'A was a merry man) took up the child.
LINE 424: 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
LINE 425: Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
LINE 426: Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
LINE 427: The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
LINE 428: To see now how a jest shall come about!
LINE 429: I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
LINE 430: I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
LINE 431: And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
LINE 432: Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
LINE 433: Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
LINE 434: To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
LINE 435: And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
LINE 436: A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
LINE 437: A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
LINE 438: 'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
LINE 439: Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
LINE 440: Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
LINE 441: Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
LINE 442: Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
LINE 443: Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
LINE 444: An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
LINE 445: Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
LINE 446: I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
LINE 447: How stands your disposition to be married?
LINE 448: Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
LINE 449: Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
LINE 450: I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
LINE 451: Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
LINE 452: Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
LINE 453: Are made already mothers. By my count,
LINE 454: I was your mother much upon these years
LINE 455: That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
LINE 456: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
LINE 457: Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
LINE 458: As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
LINE 459: Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
LINE 460: Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
LINE 461: Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
LINE 462: This night you shall behold him at our feast.
LINE 463: Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
LINE 464: And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
LINE 465: Examine every married lineament,
LINE 466: And see how one another lends content;
LINE 467: And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
LINE 468: Find written in the margent of his eyes,
LINE 469: This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
LINE 470: To beautify him only lacks a cover.
LINE 471: The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
LINE 472: For fair without the fair within to hide.
LINE 473: That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
LINE 474: That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
LINE 475: So shall you share all that he doth possess,
LINE 476: By having him making yourself no less.
LINE 477: Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
LINE 478: Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
LINE 479: Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
LINE 480: But no more deep will I endart mine eye
LINE 481: Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
LINE 482: Enter Servingman.
LINE 483: Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
LINE 484: my
LINE 485: young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
LINE 486: everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
LINE 487: follow straight.
LINE 488: Wife. We follow thee. Exit [Servingman].
LINE 489: Juliet, the County stays.
LINE 490: Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
LINE 491: Exeunt.
LINE 492: Scene IV.
LINE 493: A street.
LINE 494: Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
LINE 495: Torchbearers.
LINE 496: Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
LINE 497: Or shall we on without apology?
LINE 498: Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
LINE 499: We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
LINE 500: Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
LINE 501: Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
LINE 502: Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
LINE 503: After the prompter, for our entrance;
LINE 504: But, let them measure us by what they will,
LINE 505: We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
LINE 506: Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
LINE 507: Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
LINE 508: Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
LINE 509: Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
LINE 510: With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
LINE 511: So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
LINE 512: Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
LINE 513: And soar with them above a common bound.
LINE 514: Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
LINE 515: To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
LINE 516: I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
LINE 517: Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
LINE 518: Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
LINE 519: Too great oppression for a tender thing.
LINE 520: Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
LINE 521: Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
LINE 522: Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
LINE 523: Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
LINE 524: Give me a case to put my visage in.
LINE 525: A visor for a visor! What care I
LINE 526: What curious eye doth quote deformities?
LINE 527: Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
LINE 528: Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
LINE 529: But every man betake him to his legs.
LINE 530: Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
LINE 531: Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
LINE 532: For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
LINE 533: I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
LINE 534: The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
LINE 535: Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
LINE 536: If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
LINE 537: Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
LINE 538: Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
LINE 539: Rom. Nay, that's not so.
LINE 540: Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
LINE 541: We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
LINE 542: Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
LINE 543: Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
LINE 544: Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
LINE 545: But 'tis no wit to go.
LINE 546: Mer. Why, may one ask?
LINE 547: Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
LINE 548: Mer. And so did I.
LINE 549: Rom. Well, what was yours?
LINE 550: Mer. That dreamers often lie.
LINE 551: Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
LINE 552: Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
LINE 553: She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
LINE 554: In shape no bigger than an agate stone
LINE 555: On the forefinger of an alderman,
LINE 556: Drawn with a team of little atomies
LINE 557: Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
LINE 558: Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
LINE 559: The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
LINE 560: Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
LINE 561: Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
LINE 562: Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
LINE 563: Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
LINE 564: Not half so big as a round little worm
LINE 565: Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
LINE 566: Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
LINE 567: Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
LINE 568: Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
LINE 569: And in this state she gallops night by night
LINE 570: Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
LINE 571: O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
LINE 572: O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
LINE 573: O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
LINE 574: Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
LINE 575: Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
LINE 576: Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
LINE 577: And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
LINE 578: And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
LINE 579: Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
LINE 580: Then dreams he of another benefice.
LINE 581: Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
LINE 582: And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
LINE 583: Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
LINE 584: Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
LINE 585: Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
LINE 586: And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
LINE 587: And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
LINE 588: That plats the manes of horses in the night
LINE 589: And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
LINE 590: Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
LINE 591: This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
LINE 592: That presses them and learns them first to bear,
LINE 593: Making them women of good carriage.
LINE 594: This is she-
LINE 595: Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
LINE 596: Thou talk'st of nothing.
LINE 597: Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
LINE 598: Which are the children of an idle brain,
LINE 599: Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
LINE 600: Which is as thin of substance as the air,
LINE 601: And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
LINE 602: Even now the frozen bosom of the North
LINE 603: And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
LINE 604: Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
LINE 605: Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
LINE 606: Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
LINE 607: Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
LINE 608: Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
LINE 609: Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
LINE 610: With this night's revels and expire the term
LINE 611: Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
LINE 612: By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
LINE 613: But he that hath the steerage of my course
LINE 614: Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
LINE 615: Ben. Strike, drum.
LINE 616: They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]
LINE 617: Scene V.
LINE 618: Capulet's house.
LINE 619: Servingmen come forth with napkins.
LINE 620: 1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
LINE 621: He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
LINE 622: 2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
LINE 623: hands,
LINE 624: and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
LINE 625: 1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
LINE 626: look
LINE 627: to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
LINE 628: thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
LINE 629: Nell.
LINE 630: Anthony, and Potpan!
LINE 631: 2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
LINE 632: 1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
LINE 633: sought
LINE 634: for, in the great chamber.
LINE 635: 3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
LINE 636: Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. Exeunt.
LINE 637: Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
LINE 638: Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
LINE 639: and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
LINE 640: Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
LINE 641: Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
LINE 642: Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
LINE 643: Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
LINE 644: She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
LINE 645: Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
LINE 646: That I have worn a visor and could tell
LINE 647: A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
LINE 648: Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
LINE 649: You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
LINE 650: A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
LINE 651: Music plays, and they dance.
LINE 652: More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
LINE 653: And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
LINE 654: Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
LINE 655: Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
LINE 656: For you and I are past our dancing days.
LINE 657: How long is't now since last yourself and I
LINE 658: Were in a mask?
LINE 659: 2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
LINE 660: Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
LINE 661: 'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
LINE 662: Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
LINE 663: Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
LINE 664: 2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
LINE 665: His son is thirty.
LINE 666: Cap. Will you tell me that?
LINE 667: His son was but a ward two years ago.
LINE 668: Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
LINE 669: hand
LINE 670: Of yonder knight?
LINE 671: Serv. I know not, sir.
LINE 672: Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
LINE 673: It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
LINE 674: Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
LINE 675: Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
LINE 676: So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
LINE 677: As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
LINE 678: The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
LINE 679: And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
LINE 680: Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
LINE 681: For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
LINE 682: Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
LINE 683: Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
LINE 684: Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
LINE 685: To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
LINE 686: Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
LINE 687: To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
LINE 688: Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
LINE 689: Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
LINE 690: A villain, that is hither come in spite
LINE 691: To scorn at our solemnity this night.
LINE 692: Cap. Young Romeo is it?
LINE 693: Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
LINE 694: Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
LINE 695: 'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
LINE 696: And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
LINE 697: To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
LINE 698: I would not for the wealth of all this town
LINE 699: Here in my house do him disparagement.
LINE 700: Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
LINE 701: It is my will; the which if thou respect,
LINE 702: Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
LINE 703: An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
LINE 704: Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
LINE 705: I'll not endure him.
LINE 706: Cap. He shall be endur'd.
LINE 707: What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
LINE 708: Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
LINE 709: You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
LINE 710: You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
LINE 711: You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
LINE 712: Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
LINE 713: Cap. Go to, go to!
LINE 714: You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
LINE 715: This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
LINE 716: You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
LINE 717: Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
LINE 718: Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
LINE 719: I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
LINE 720: Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
LINE 721: Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
LINE 722: I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
LINE 723: Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall. Exit.
LINE 724: Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
LINE 725: This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
LINE 726: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
LINE 727: To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
LINE 728: Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
LINE 729: Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
LINE 730: For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
LINE 731: And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
LINE 732: Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
LINE 733: Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
LINE 734: Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
LINE 735: They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
LINE 736: Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
LINE 737: Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
LINE 738: Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. [Kisses her.]
LINE 739: Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
LINE 740: Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
LINE 741: Give me my sin again. [Kisses her.]
LINE 742: Jul. You kiss by th' book.
LINE 743: Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
LINE 744: Rom. What is her mother?
LINE 745: Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
LINE 746: Her mother is the lady of the house.
LINE 747: And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
LINE 748: I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
LINE 749: I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
LINE 750: Shall have the chinks.
LINE 751: Rom. Is she a Capulet?
LINE 752: O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
LINE 753: Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
LINE 754: Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
LINE 755: Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
LINE 756: We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
LINE 757: Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
LINE 758: I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
LINE 759: More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to
LINE 760: bed.
LINE 761: Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
LINE 762: I'll to my rest.
LINE 763: Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
LINE 764: Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
LINE 765: Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
LINE 766: Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
LINE 767: Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
LINE 768: Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
LINE 769: Nurse. I know not.
LINE 770: Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
LINE 771: My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
LINE 772: Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
LINE 773: The only son of your great enemy.
LINE 774: Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
LINE 775: Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
LINE 776: Prodigious birth of love it is to me
LINE 777: That I must love a loathed enemy.
LINE 778: Nurse. What's this? what's this?
LINE 779: Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
LINE 780: Of one I danc'd withal.
LINE 781: One calls within, 'Juliet.'
LINE 782: Nurse. Anon, anon!
LINE 783: Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. Exeunt.

LINE 793: Enter Chorus.
LINE 794: Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
LINE 795: And young affection gapes to be his heir;
LINE 796: That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
LINE 797: With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
LINE 798: Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
LINE 799: Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
LINE 800: But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
LINE 801: And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
LINE 802: Being held a foe, he may not have access
LINE 803: To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
LINE 804: And she as much in love, her means much less
LINE 805: To meet her new beloved anywhere;
LINE 806: But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
LINE 807: Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
LINE 808: Exit.
