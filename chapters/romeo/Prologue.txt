LINE 1: Two households, both alike in dignity,
LINE 2: In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
LINE 3: From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
LINE 4: Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
LINE 5: From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
LINE 6: A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
LINE 7: Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
LINE 8: Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
LINE 9: The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
LINE 10: And the continuance of their parents' rage,
LINE 11: Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
LINE 12: Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
LINE 13: The which if you with patient ears attend,
LINE 14: What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
LINE 15: [Exit.]
