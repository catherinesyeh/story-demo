LINE 1: ACT IV. Scene I.
LINE 2: Friar Laurence's cell.
LINE 3: Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
LINE 4: Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
LINE 5: Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
LINE 6: And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
LINE 7: Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
LINE 8: Uneven is the course; I like it not.
LINE 9: Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
LINE 10: And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
LINE 11: For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
LINE 12: Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
LINE 13: That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
LINE 14: And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
LINE 15: To stop the inundation of her tears,
LINE 16: Which, too much minded by herself alone,
LINE 17: May be put from her by society.
LINE 18: Now do you know the reason of this haste.
LINE 19: Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
LINE 20: Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
LINE 21: Enter Juliet.
LINE 22: Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
LINE 23: Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
LINE 24: Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
LINE 25: Jul. What must be shall be.
LINE 26: Friar. That's a certain text.
LINE 27: Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
LINE 28: Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
LINE 29: Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
LINE 30: Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
LINE 31: Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
LINE 32: Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
LINE 33: Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
LINE 34: Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
LINE 35: Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
LINE 36: For it was bad enough before their spite.
LINE 37: Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
LINE 38: Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
LINE 39: And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
LINE 40: Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
LINE 41: Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
LINE 42: Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
LINE 43: Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
LINE 44: Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
LINE 45: My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
LINE 46: Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
LINE 47: Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
LINE 48: Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit.
LINE 49: Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
LINE 50: Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
LINE 51: Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
LINE 52: It strains me past the compass of my wits.
LINE 53: I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
LINE 54: On Thursday next be married to this County.
LINE 55: Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
LINE 56: Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
LINE 57: If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
LINE 58: Do thou but call my resolution wise
LINE 59: And with this knife I'll help it presently.
LINE 60: God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
LINE 61: And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
LINE 62: Shall be the label to another deed,
LINE 63: Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
LINE 64: Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
LINE 65: Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
LINE 66: Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
LINE 67: 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
LINE 68: Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
LINE 69: Which the commission of thy years and art
LINE 70: Could to no issue of true honour bring.
LINE 71: Be not so long to speak. I long to die
LINE 72: If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
LINE 73: Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
LINE 74: Which craves as desperate an execution
LINE 75: As that is desperate which we would prevent.
LINE 76: If, rather than to marry County Paris
LINE 77: Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
LINE 78: Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
LINE 79: A thing like death to chide away this shame,
LINE 80: That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
LINE 81: And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
LINE 82: Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
LINE 83: From off the battlements of yonder tower,
LINE 84: Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
LINE 85: Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
LINE 86: Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
LINE 87: O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
LINE 88: With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
LINE 89: Or bid me go into a new-made grave
LINE 90: And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
LINE 91: Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
LINE 92: And I will do it without fear or doubt,
LINE 93: To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
LINE 94: Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
LINE 95: To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
LINE 96: To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
LINE 97: Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
LINE 98: Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
LINE 99: And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
LINE 100: When presently through all thy veins shall run
LINE 101: A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
LINE 102: Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
LINE 103: No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
LINE 104: The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
LINE 105: To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
LINE 106: Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
LINE 107: Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
LINE 108: Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
LINE 109: And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
LINE 110: Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
LINE 111: And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
LINE 112: Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
LINE 113: To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
LINE 114: Then, as the manner of our country is,
LINE 115: In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
LINE 116: Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
LINE 117: Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
LINE 118: In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
LINE 119: Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
LINE 120: And hither shall he come; and he and I
LINE 121: Will watch thy waking, and that very night
LINE 122: Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
LINE 123: And this shall free thee from this present shame,
LINE 124: If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
LINE 125: Abate thy valour in the acting it.
LINE 126: Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
LINE 127: Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
LINE 128: In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
LINE 129: To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
LINE 130: Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
LINE 131: Farewell, dear father.
LINE 132: Exeunt.
LINE 133: Scene II.
LINE 134: Capulet's house.
LINE 135: Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
LINE 136: two or three.
LINE 137: Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
LINE 138: [Exit a Servingman.]
LINE 139: Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
LINE 140: Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
LINE 141: lick
LINE 142: their fingers.
LINE 143: Cap. How canst thou try them so?
LINE 144: Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
LINE 145: fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
LINE 146: with
LINE 147: me.
LINE 148: Cap. Go, begone.
LINE 149: Exit Servingman.
LINE 150: We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
LINE 151: What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
LINE 152: Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
LINE 153: Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
LINE 154: A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
LINE 155: Enter Juliet.
LINE 156: Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
LINE 157: Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
LINE 158: Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
LINE 159: Of disobedient opposition
LINE 160: To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
LINE 161: By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
LINE 162: To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
LINE 163: Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
LINE 164: Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
LINE 165: I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
LINE 166: Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
LINE 167: And gave him what becomed love I might,
LINE 168: Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
LINE 169: Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
LINE 170: This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
LINE 171: Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
LINE 172: Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
LINE 173: All our whole city is much bound to him.
LINE 174: Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
LINE 175: To help me sort such needful ornaments
LINE 176: As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
LINE 177: Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
LINE 178: Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
LINE 179: Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
LINE 180: Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
LINE 181: 'Tis now near night.
LINE 182: Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
LINE 183: And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
LINE 184: Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
LINE 185: I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
LINE 186: I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
LINE 187: They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
LINE 188: To County Paris, to prepare him up
LINE 189: Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
LINE 190: Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
LINE 191: Exeunt.
LINE 192: Scene III.
LINE 193: Juliet's chamber.
LINE 194: Enter Juliet and Nurse.
LINE 195: Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
LINE 196: I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
LINE 197: For I have need of many orisons
LINE 198: To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
LINE 199: Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
LINE 200: Enter Mother.
LINE 201: Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
LINE 202: Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
LINE 203: As are behoveful for our state to-morrow.
LINE 204: So please you, let me now be left alone,
LINE 205: And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
LINE 206: For I am sure you have your hands full all
LINE 207: In this so sudden business.
LINE 208: Mother. Good night.
LINE 209: Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
LINE 210: Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
LINE 211: Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
LINE 212: I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
LINE 213: That almost freezes up the heat of life.
LINE 214: I'll call them back again to comfort me.
LINE 215: Nurse!- What should she do here?
LINE 216: My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
LINE 217: Come, vial.
LINE 218: What if this mixture do not work at all?
LINE 219: Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
LINE 220: No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
LINE 221: Lays down a dagger.
LINE 222: What if it be a poison which the friar
LINE 223: Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
LINE 224: Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
LINE 225: Because he married me before to Romeo?
LINE 226: I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
LINE 227: For he hath still been tried a holy man.
LINE 228: I will not entertain so bad a thought.
LINE 229: How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
LINE 230: I wake before the time that Romeo
LINE 231: Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
LINE 232: Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
LINE 233: To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
LINE 234: And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
LINE 235: Or, if I live, is it not very like
LINE 236: The horrible conceit of death and night,
LINE 237: Together with the terror of the place-
LINE 238: As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
LINE 239: Where for this many hundred years the bones
LINE 240: Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
LINE 241: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
LINE 242: Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
LINE 243: At some hours in the night spirits resort-
LINE 244: Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
LINE 245: So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
LINE 246: And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
LINE 247: That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
LINE 248: O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
LINE 249: Environed with all these hideous fears,
LINE 250: And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
LINE 251: And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,
LINE 252: And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
LINE 253: As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
LINE 254: O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
LINE 255: Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
LINE 256: Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
LINE 257: Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
LINE 258: She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
LINE 259: Scene IV.
LINE 260: Capulet's house.
LINE 261: Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
LINE 262: Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
LINE 263: Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
LINE 264: Enter Old Capulet.
LINE 265: Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
LINE 266: The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
LINE 267: Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
LINE 268: Spare not for cost.
LINE 269: Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
LINE 270: Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
LINE 271: For this night's watching.
LINE 272: Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
LINE 273: All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
LINE 274: Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
LINE 275: But I will watch you from such watching now.
LINE 276: Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
LINE 277: Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
LINE 278: Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
LINE 279: What is there? Now, fellow,
LINE 280: Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
LINE 281: Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
LINE 282: logs.
LINE 283: Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
LINE 284: Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
LINE 285: And never trouble Peter for the matter.
LINE 286: Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
LINE 287: Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis
LINE 288: day.
LINE 289: The County will be here with music straight,
LINE 290: For so he said he would. Play music.
LINE 291: I hear him near.
LINE 292: Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
LINE 293: Enter Nurse.
LINE 294: Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
LINE 295: I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
LINE 296: Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
LINE 297: Make haste, I say.
LINE 298: [Exeunt.]
LINE 299: Scene V.
LINE 300: Juliet's chamber.
LINE 301: [Enter Nurse.]
LINE 302: Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her,
LINE 303: she.
LINE 304: Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
LINE 305: Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
LINE 306: What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
LINE 307: Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
LINE 308: The County Paris hath set up his rest
LINE 309: That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
LINE 310: Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
LINE 311: I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
LINE 312: Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
LINE 313: He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
LINE 314: [Draws aside the curtains.]
LINE 315: What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
LINE 316: I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
LINE 317: Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
LINE 318: O weraday that ever I was born!
LINE 319: Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
LINE 320: Enter Mother.
LINE 321: Mother. What noise is here?
LINE 322: Nurse. O lamentable day!
LINE 323: Mother. What is the matter?
LINE 324: Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
LINE 325: Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
LINE 326: Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
LINE 327: Help, help! Call help.
LINE 328: Enter Father.
LINE 329: Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
LINE 330: Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
LINE 331: Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
LINE 332: Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
LINE 333: Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
LINE 334: Life and these lips have long been separated.
LINE 335: Death lies on her like an untimely frost
LINE 336: Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
LINE 337: Nurse. O lamentable day!
LINE 338: Mother. O woful time!
LINE 339: Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
LINE 340: Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
LINE 341: Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
LINE 342: Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
LINE 343: Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
LINE 344: O son, the night before thy wedding day
LINE 345: Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
LINE 346: Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
LINE 347: Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
LINE 348: My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
LINE 349: And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
LINE 350: Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
LINE 351: And doth it give me such a sight as this?
LINE 352: Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
LINE 353: Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
LINE 354: In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
LINE 355: But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
LINE 356: But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
LINE 357: And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
LINE 358: Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
LINE 359: Most lamentable day, most woful day
LINE 360: That ever ever I did yet behold!
LINE 361: O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
LINE 362: Never was seen so black a day as this.
LINE 363: O woful day! O woful day!
LINE 364: Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
LINE 365: Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
LINE 366: By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
LINE 367: O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
LINE 368: Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
LINE 369: Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
LINE 370: To murther, murther our solemnity?
LINE 371: O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
LINE 372: Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
LINE 373: And with my child my joys are buried!
LINE 374: Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
LINE 375: In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
LINE 376: Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
LINE 377: And all the better is it for the maid.
LINE 378: Your part in her you could not keep from death,
LINE 379: But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
LINE 380: The most you sought was her promotion,
LINE 381: For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
LINE 382: And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
LINE 383: Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
LINE 384: O, in this love, you love your child so ill
LINE 385: That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
LINE 386: She's not well married that lives married long,
LINE 387: But she's best married that dies married young.
LINE 388: Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
LINE 389: On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
LINE 390: In all her best array bear her to church;
LINE 391: For though fond nature bids us all lament,
LINE 392: Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
LINE 393: Cap. All things that we ordained festival
LINE 394: Turn from their office to black funeral-
LINE 395: Our instruments to melancholy bells,
LINE 396: Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
LINE 397: Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
LINE 398: Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
LINE 399: And all things change them to the contrary.
LINE 400: Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
LINE 401: And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
LINE 402: To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
LINE 403: The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
LINE 404: Move them no more by crossing their high will.
LINE 405: Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
LINE 406: 1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
LINE 407: Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
LINE 408: For well you know this is a pitiful case. [Exit.]
LINE 409: 1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
LINE 410: Enter Peter.
LINE 411: Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
LINE 412: O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
LINE 413: 1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'?
LINE 414: Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
LINE 415: full
LINE 416: of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
LINE 417: 1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
LINE 418: Pet. You will not then?
LINE 419: 1. Mus. No.
LINE 420: Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
LINE 421: 1. Mus. What will you give us?
LINE 422: Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
LINE 423: minstrel.
LINE 424: 1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
LINE 425: Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your
LINE 426: pate.
LINE 427: I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
LINE 428: note
LINE 429: me?
LINE 430: 1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
LINE 431: 2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
LINE 432: Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
LINE 433: iron
LINE 434: wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
LINE 435: 'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
LINE 436: And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
LINE 437: Then music with her silver sound'-
LINE 438: Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
LINE 439: What say you, Simon Catling?
LINE 440: 1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
LINE 441: Pet. Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
LINE 442: 2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for
LINE 443: silver.
