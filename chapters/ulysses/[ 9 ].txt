LINE 1: Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
LINE 2: —And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.
LINE 3: A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms
LINE 4: against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in
LINE 5: real life.
LINE 6: He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step
LINE 7: backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.
LINE 8: A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a
LINE 9: noiseless beck.
LINE 10: —Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful
LINE 11: ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always
LINE 12: feels that Goethe's judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.
LINE 13: Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door
LINE 14: he gave his large ear all to the attendant's words: heard them: and was
LINE 15: gone.
LINE 16: Two left.
LINE 17: —Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes
LINE 18: before his death.
LINE 19: —Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with
LINE 20: elder's gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation? _The Sorrows
LINE 21: of Satan_ he calls it.
LINE 22: Smile. Smile Cranly's smile.
LINE 23: First he tickled her
LINE 24: Then he patted her
LINE 25: Then he passed the female catheter
LINE 26: For he was a medical
LINE 27: Jolly old medi...
LINE 28: —I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the
LINE 29: mystic mind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.
LINE 30: Glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought
LINE 31: the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He
LINE 32: laughed low: a sizar's laugh of Trinity: unanswered.
LINE 33: Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood
LINE 34: Tears such as angels weep.
LINE 35: Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.
LINE 36: He holds my follies hostage.
LINE 37: Cranly's eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed
LINE 38: Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.
LINE 39: And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve. In the
LINE 40: shadow of the glen he cooees for them. My soul's youth I gave him,
LINE 41: night by night. God speed. Good hunting.
LINE 42: Mulligan has my telegram.
LINE 43: Folly. Persist.
LINE 44: —Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a
LINE 45: figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare's Hamlet
LINE 46: though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.
LINE 47: —All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his
LINE 48: shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.
LINE 49: Clergymen's discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal
LINE 50: to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a
LINE 51: work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of
LINE 52: Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,
LINE 53: the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
LINE 54: wisdom, Plato's world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of
LINE 55: schoolboys for schoolboys.
LINE 56: A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike
LINE 57: me!
LINE 58: —The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.
LINE 59: Aristotle was once Plato's schoolboy.
LINE 60: —And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One
LINE 61: can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
LINE 62: He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.
LINE 63: Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the
LINE 64: heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who
LINE 65: suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon
LINE 66: the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.
LINE 67: Dunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name
LINE 68: Ineffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no
LINE 69: secret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to
LINE 70: see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of
LINE 71: light, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the
LINE 72: plane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.
LINE 73: must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very
LINE 74: illustrious sister H.P.B.'s elemental.
LINE 75: O, fie! Out on't! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn't to look, missus, so you
LINE 76: naughtn't when a lady's ashowing of her elemental.
LINE 77: Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with
LINE 78: grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.
LINE 79: —That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet's musings about
LINE 80: the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
LINE 81: undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato's.
LINE 82: John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
LINE 83: —Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
LINE 84: with Plato.
LINE 85: —Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
LINE 86: commonwealth?
LINE 87: Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of
LINE 88: allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the
LINE 89: street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see.
LINE 90: Through spaces smaller than red globules of man's blood they
LINE 91: creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity of which this
LINE 92: vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through
LINE 93: which all future plunges to the past.
LINE 94: Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.
LINE 95: —Haines is gone, he said.
LINE 96: —Is he?
LINE 97: —I was showing him Jubainville's book. He's quite enthusiastic, don't
LINE 98: you know, about Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn't bring him in
LINE 99: to hear the discussion. He's gone to Gill's to buy it.
LINE 100: Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
LINE 101: To greet the callous public.
LINE 102: Writ, I ween, 'twas not my wish
LINE 103: In lean unlovely English.
LINE 104: —The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.
LINE 105: We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
LINE 106: twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.
LINE 107: —People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
LINE 108: Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
LINE 109: world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant's heart on
LINE 110: the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
LINE 111: living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce
LINE 112: the sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest
LINE 113: flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed
LINE 114: only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer's Phæacians.
LINE 115: From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
LINE 116: —Mallarmé, don't you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
LINE 117: poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
LINE 118: _Hamlet._ He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même_, don't
LINE 119: you know, _reading the book of himself_. He describes _Hamlet_ given in
LINE 120: a French town, don't you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.
LINE 121: His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.
LINE 122: _Hamlet
LINE 123: ou
LINE 124: Le Distrait
LINE 125: Pièce de Shakespeare_
LINE 126: He repeated to John Eglinton's newgathered frown:
LINE 127: —_Pièce de Shakespeare_, don't you know. It's so French. The French
LINE 128: point of view. _Hamlet ou_...
LINE 129: —The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.
LINE 130: John Eglinton laughed.
LINE 131: —Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but
LINE 132: distressingly shortsighted in some matters.
LINE 133: Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
LINE 134: —A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not
LINE 135: for nothing was he a butcher's son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
LINE 136: spitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father's one.
LINE 137: Our Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don't hesitate to shoot.
LINE 138: The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
LINE 139: concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.
LINE 140: Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.
LINE 141: Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none
LINE 142: But we had spared...
LINE 143: Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.
LINE 144: —He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for
LINE 145: Mr Best's behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our
LINE 146: flesh creep.
LINE 147: List! List! O List!
LINE 148: My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.
LINE 149: If thou didst ever...
LINE 150: —What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded
LINE 151: into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
LINE 152: manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
LINE 153: lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,
LINE 154: returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?
LINE 155: John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
LINE 156: Lifted.
LINE 157: —It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
LINE 158: swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the
LINE 159: bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.
LINE 160: Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
LINE 161: groundlings.
LINE 162: Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.
LINE 163: —Shakespeare has left the huguenot's house in Silver street and walks
LINE 164: by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the
LINE 165: pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon
LINE 166: has other thoughts.
LINE 167: Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
LINE 168: —The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
LINE 169: castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is
LINE 170: the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare
LINE 171: who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not
LINE 172: vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to
LINE 173: Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of
LINE 174: cerecloth, calling him by a name:
LINE 175: Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit,
LINE 176: bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
LINE 177: young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
LINE 178: died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
LINE 179: Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
LINE 180: the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
LINE 181: to his own son's name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
LINE 182: prince Hamlet's twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
LINE 183: he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
LINE 184: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is
LINE 185: the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
LINE 186: —But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
LINE 187: impatiently.
LINE 188: Art thou there, truepenny?
LINE 189: —Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I
LINE 190: mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the
LINE 191: poet lived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de
LINE 192: l'Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day,
LINE 193: the poet's drinking, the poet's debts. We have _King Lear_: and it is
LINE 194: immortal.
LINE 195: Mr Best's face, appealed to, agreed.
LINE 196: Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,
LINE 197: Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...
LINE 198: How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?
LINE 199: Marry, I wanted it.
LINE 200: Take thou this noble.
LINE 201: Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson's bed, clergyman's
LINE 202: daughter. Agenbite of inwit.
LINE 203: Do you intend to pay it back?
LINE 204: O, yes.
LINE 205: When? Now?
LINE 206: Well... No.
LINE 207: When, then?
LINE 208: I paid my way. I paid my way.
LINE 209: Steady on. He's from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe
LINE 210: it.
LINE 211: Wait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got
LINE 212: pound.
LINE 213: Buzz. Buzz.
LINE 214: But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under
LINE 215: everchanging forms.
LINE 216: I that sinned and prayed and fasted.
LINE 217: A child Conmee saved from pandies.
LINE 218: I, I and I. I.
LINE 219: A.E.I.O.U.
LINE 220: —Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?
LINE 221: John Eglinton's carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid
LINE 222: for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
LINE 223: —She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She
LINE 224: saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She
LINE 225: bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids
LINE 226: closed when he lay on his deathbed.
LINE 227: Mother's deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this
LINE 228: world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. _Liliata
LINE 229: rutilantium._
LINE 230: I wept alone.
LINE 231: John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
LINE 232: —The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
LINE 233: out of it as quickly and as best he could.
LINE 234: —Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His
LINE 235: errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
LINE 236: Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
LINE 237: softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
LINE 238: —A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
LINE 239: discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn
LINE 240: from Xanthippe?
LINE 241: —Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
LINE 242: into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
LINE 243: nomen!_), Socratididion's Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
LINE 244: know. But neither the midwife's lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
LINE 245: from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
LINE 246: —But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best's quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem
LINE 247: to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
LINE 248: His look went from brooder's beard to carper's skull, to remind, to
LINE 249: chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,
LINE 250: guiltless though maligned.
LINE 251: —He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.
LINE 252: He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
LINE 253: _The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we
LINE 254: should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of
LINE 255: hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, _Venus
LINE 256: and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is
LINE 257: Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and
LINE 258: beautiful. Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
LINE 259: passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
LINE 260: the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her
LINE 261: and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy.
LINE 262: Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He
LINE 263: was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way.
LINE 264: By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and
LINE 265: twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
LINE 266: to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
LINE 267: wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.
LINE 268: And my turn? When?
LINE 269: Come!
LINE 270: —Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
LINE 271: brightly.
LINE 272: He murmured then with blond delight for all:
LINE 273: Between the acres of the rye
LINE 274: These pretty countryfolk would lie.
LINE 275: Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.
LINE 276: A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
LINE 277: cooperative watch.
LINE 278: —I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._
LINE 279: Whither away? Exploitable ground.
LINE 280: —Are you going? John Eglinton's active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you
LINE 281: at Moore's tonight? Piper is coming.
LINE 282: —Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?
LINE 283: Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.
LINE 284: —I don't know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get
LINE 285: away in time.
LINE 286: Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. _Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we
LINE 287: tried to pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an
LINE 288: Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.
LINE 289: The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship,
LINE 290: ringroundabout him. Louis H. Victory. T. Caulfield Irwin. Lotus ladies
LINE 291: tend them i'the eyes, their pineal glands aglow. Filled with his god,
LINE 292: he thrones, Buddh under plantain. Gulfer of souls, engulfer. Hesouls,
LINE 293: shesouls, shoals of souls. Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled,
LINE 294: whirling, they bewail.
LINE 295: In quintessential triviality
LINE 296: For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.
LINE 297: —They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian
LINE 298: said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering
LINE 299: together a sheaf of our younger poets' verses. We are all looking
LINE 300: forward anxiously.
LINE 301: Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
LINE 302: lighted, shone.
LINE 303: See this. Remember.
LINE 304: Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
LINE 305: ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with
LINE 306: two index fingers. Aristotle's experiment. One or two? Necessity is
LINE 307: that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.
LINE 308: Argal, one hat is one hat.
LINE 309: Listen.
LINE 310: Young Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
LINE 311: Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he? I
LINE 312: liked Colum's _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do
LINE 313: you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: _As in wild
LINE 314: earth a Grecian vase_. Did he? I hope you'll be able to come tonight.
LINE 315: Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did
LINE 316: you hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is
LINE 317: Martyn's wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don
LINE 318: Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr
LINE 319: Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful
LINE 320: countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O,
LINE 321: yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James
LINE 322: Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it
LINE 323: seems.
LINE 324: Cordelia. _Cordoglio._ Lir's loneliest daughter.
LINE 325: Nookshotten. Now your best French polish.
LINE 326: —Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be
LINE 327: so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...
LINE 328: —O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much
LINE 329: correspondence.
LINE 330: —I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.
LINE 331: God ild you. The pigs' paper. Bullockbefriending.
LINE 332: Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too. Are we going to be
LINE 333: read? I feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope
LINE 334: you will come round tonight. Bring Starkey.
LINE 335: Stephen sat down.
LINE 336: The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask
LINE 337: said:
LINE 338: —Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.
LINE 339: He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
LINE 340: chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
LINE 341: —Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?
LINE 342: Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?
LINE 343: —Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
LINE 344: first a sundering.
LINE 345: —Yes.
LINE 346: Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
LINE 347: from hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women
LINE 348: he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
LINE 349: bully tapsters' wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack
LINE 350: dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
LINE 351: cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
LINE 352: grave and unforgiven.
LINE 353: —Yes. So you think...
LINE 354: The door closed behind the outgoer.
LINE 355: Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
LINE 356: brooding air.
LINE 357: A vestal's lamp.
LINE 358: Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do
LINE 359: had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
LINE 360: the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore
LINE 361: when he lived among women.
LINE 362: Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.
LINE 363: Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice
LINE 364: of that Egyptian highpriest. _In painted chambers loaded with
LINE 365: tilebooks._
LINE 366: They are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of
LINE 367: death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
LINE 368: their will.
LINE 369: —Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
LINE 370: enigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
LINE 371: much. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.
LINE 372: —But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn't it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind
LINE 373: of private paper, don't you know, of his private life. I mean, I don't
LINE 374: care a button, don't you know, who is killed or who is guilty...
LINE 375: He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
LINE 376: defiance. His private papers in the original. _Ta an bad ar an tir.
LINE 377: Taim in mo shagart_. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.
LINE 378: Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
LINE 379: —I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I
LINE 380: may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
LINE 381: Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
LINE 382: Bear with me.
LINE 383: Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
LINE 384: wrinkled brows. A basilisk. _E quando vede l'uomo l'attosca_. Messer
LINE 385: Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.
LINE 386: —As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
LINE 387: from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the
LINE 388: artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast
LINE 389: is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of
LINE 390: new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father
LINE 391: the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of
LINE 392: imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which
LINE 393: I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to
LINE 394: be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit
LINE 395: here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.
LINE 396: Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
LINE 397: —Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness
LINE 398: might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
LINE 399: the son.
LINE 400: Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
LINE 401: —That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
LINE 402: John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
LINE 403: —If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug
LINE 404: in the market. The plays of Shakespeare's later years which Renan
LINE 405: admired so much breathe another spirit.
LINE 406: —The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
LINE 407: —There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
LINE 408: sundering.
LINE 409: Said that.
LINE 410: —If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
LINE 411: the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
LINE 412: look to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a
LINE 413: man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
LINE 414: prince of Tyre?
LINE 415: Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.
LINE 416: —A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.
LINE 417: —The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
LINE 418: quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they
LINE 419: lead to the town.
LINE 420: Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon's wild oats. Cypherjugglers
LINE 421: going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good
LINE 422: masters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the
LINE 423: sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_. Booted the twain and staved.
LINE 424: How many miles to Dublin?
LINE 425: Three score and ten, sir.
LINE 426: Will we be there by candlelight?
LINE 427: —Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
LINE 428: period.
LINE 429: —Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
LINE 430: name is, say of it?
LINE 431: —Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
LINE 432: that which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter's
LINE 433: child. _My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
LINE 434: man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?
LINE 435: —The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. _L'art d'être
LINE 436: grand_...
LINE 437: —Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,
LINE 438: another image?
LINE 439: Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all
LINE 440: men. _Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
LINE 441: ..._
LINE 442: —His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
LINE 443: all experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The
LINE 444: images of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them
LINE 445: grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.
LINE 446: The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
LINE 447: —I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
LINE 448: the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
LINE 449: George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles
LINE 450: on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant. Oddly
LINE 451: enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of
LINE 452: the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I
LINE 453: own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more
LINE 454: in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have
LINE 455: been.
LINE 456: Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk's egg,
LINE 457: prize of their fray.
LINE 458: He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost
LINE 459: love thy man?
LINE 460: —That may be too, Stephen said. There's a saying of Goethe's which Mr
LINE 461: Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
LINE 462: will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a
LINE 463: _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
LINE 464: scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord
LINE 465: of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had
LINE 466: written _Romeo and Juliet_. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely
LINE 467: killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)
LINE 468: and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play
LINE 469: victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will
LINE 470: not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of
LINE 471: the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew
LINE 472: is worsted yet there remains to her woman's invisible weapon. There is,
LINE 473: I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
LINE 474: passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own
LINE 475: understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages
LINE 476: commingle in a whirlpool.
LINE 477: They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
LINE 478: —The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
LINE 479: porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep
LINE 480: cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their
LINE 481: souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the
LINE 482: beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet's ghost could not know
LINE 483: of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the
LINE 484: speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,
LINE 485: backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with
LINE 486: him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare,
LINE 487: with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has
LINE 488: piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But,
LINE 489: because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
LINE 490: personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
LINE 491: has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind
LINE 492: by Elsinore's rocks or what you will, the sea's voice, a voice heard
LINE 493: only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
LINE 494: consubstantial with the father.
LINE 495: —Amen! was responded from the doorway.
LINE 496: Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
LINE 497: _Entr'acte_.
LINE 498: A ribald face, sullen as a dean's, Buck Mulligan came forward, then
LINE 499: blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.
LINE 500: —You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he
LINE 501: asked of Stephen.
LINE 502: Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a
LINE 503: bauble.
LINE 504: They make him welcome. _Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._
LINE 505: Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.
LINE 506: He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,
LINE 507: Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,
LINE 508: stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on
LINE 509: crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven
LINE 510: and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His
LINE 511: Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and
LINE 512: dead when all the quick shall be dead already.
LINE 513: [Illustration]
LINE 514: He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells
LINE 515: aquiring.
LINE 516: —Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.
LINE 517: Mr Mulligan, I'll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
LINE 518: Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
LINE 519: He smiled on all sides equally.
LINE 520: Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
LINE 521: —Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
LINE 522: A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
LINE 523: —To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like
LINE 524: Synge.
LINE 525: Mr Best turned to him.
LINE 526: —Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He'll see you after at
LINE 527: the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's _Lovesongs of Connacht_.
LINE 528: —I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
LINE 529: —The bard's fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
LINE 530: perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress
LINE 531: played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.
LINE 532: Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be
LINE 533: an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He
LINE 534: swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
LINE 535: —The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde's, Mr Best said,
LINE 536: lifting his brilliant notebook. That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he
LINE 537: proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all
LINE 538: hues.
LINE 539: —For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
LINE 540: Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
LINE 541: —I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of
LINE 542: course it's all paradox, don't you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the
LINE 543: colour, but it's so typical the way he works it out. It's the very
LINE 544: essence of Wilde, don't you know. The light touch.
LINE 545: His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.
LINE 546: Tame essence of Wilde.
LINE 547: You're darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan
LINE 548: Deasy's ducats.
LINE 549: How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
LINE 550: For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
LINE 551: Wit. You would give your five wits for youth's proud livery he pranks
LINE 552: in. Lineaments of gratified desire.
LINE 553: There be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool
LINE 554: ruttime send them. Yea, turtledove her.
LINE 555: Eve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in's kiss.
LINE 556: —Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking.
LINE 557: The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
LINE 558: They talked seriously of mocker's seriousness.
LINE 559: Buck Mulligan's again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
LINE 560: wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His
LINE 561: mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
LINE 562: —Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
LINE 563: He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
LINE 564: —_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the
LINE 565: immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus. Where did you
LINE 566: launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four
LINE 567: quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram!
LINE 568: Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer!
LINE 569: O, you priestified Kinchite!
LINE 570: Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
LINE 571: querulous brogue:
LINE 572: —It's what I'm telling you, mister honey, it's queer and sick we were,
LINE 573: Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. 'Twas murmur we did
LINE 574: for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I'm thinking, and he limp with
LINE 575: leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery's
LINE 576: sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
LINE 577: He wailed:
LINE 578: —And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
LINE 579: conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
LINE 580: drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
LINE 581: Stephen laughed.
LINE 582: Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
LINE 583: —The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard
LINE 584: you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He's out in pampooties to
LINE 585: murder you.
LINE 586: —Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
LINE 587: Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
LINE 588: ceiling.
LINE 589: —Murder you! he laughed.
LINE 590: Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of
LINE 591: lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words,
LINE 592: palabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,
LINE 593: brandishing a winebottle. _C'est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish. His
LINE 594: image, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i'the forest.
LINE 595: —Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
LINE 596: —... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his
LINE 597: _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms... Yes?
LINE 598: What is it?
LINE 599: —There's a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
LINE 600: offering a card. From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the
LINE 601: _Kilkenny People_ for last year.
LINE 602: —Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
LINE 603: He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
LINE 604: asked, creaked, asked:
LINE 605: —Is he?... O, there!
LINE 606: Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked
LINE 607: with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
LINE 608: honest broadbrim.
LINE 609: —This gentleman? _Freeman's Journal? Kilkenny People?_ To be sure. Good
LINE 610: day, sir. _Kilkenny_... We have certainly...
LINE 611: A patient silhouette waited, listening.
LINE 612: —All the leading provincial... _Northern Whig, Cork Examiner,
LINE 613: Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this
LINE 614: gentleman... If you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me...
LINE 615: This way... Please, sir...
LINE 616: Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
LINE 617: dark figure following his hasty heels.
LINE 618: The door closed.
LINE 619: —The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
LINE 620: He jumped up and snatched the card.
LINE 621: —What's his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
LINE 622: He rattled on:
LINE 623: —Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the
LINE 624: museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth
LINE 625: that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to
LINE 626: her. _Life of life, thy lips enkindle._
LINE 627: Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
LINE 628: —He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker
LINE 629: than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.
LINE 630: Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the
LINE 631: maiden hid_.
LINE 632: —We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval.
LINE 633: We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if
LINE 634: at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
LINE 635: —Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
LINE 636: from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
LINE 637: in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty
LINE 638: years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a
LINE 639: salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was
LINE 640: rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called
LINE 641: it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack,
LINE 642: honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons,
LINE 643: ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a
LINE 644: million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The
LINE 645: gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of
LINE 646: Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its
LINE 647: chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know
LINE 648: Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage to her
LINE 649: bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,
LINE 650: overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
LINE 651: and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon's
LINE 652: blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_. And the gay
LINE 653: lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
LINE 654: Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the
LINE 655: punks of the bankside, a penny a time.
LINE 656: Cours la Reine. _Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites
LINE 657: cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?_
LINE 658: —The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford's
LINE 659: mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.
LINE 660: Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
LINE 661: —Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
LINE 662: —And Harry of six wives' daughter. And other lady friends from
LINE 663: neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those
LINE 664: twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
LINE 665: behind the diamond panes?
LINE 666: Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
LINE 667: he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of
LINE 668: Juno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.
LINE 669: Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
LINE 670: Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton's desk sharply.
LINE 671: —Whom do you suspect? he challenged.
LINE 672: —Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice
LINE 673: spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
LINE 674: Love that dare not speak its name.
LINE 675: —As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
LINE 676: lord.
LINE 677: Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
LINE 678: —It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
LINE 679: other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for
LINE 680: the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he
LINE 681: had a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a
LINE 682: bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost's mind: a broken vow and the
LINE 683: dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband's
LINE 684: brother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer,
LINE 685: twice a wooer.
LINE 686: Stephen turned boldly in his chair.
LINE 687: —The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you
LINE 688: deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
LINE 689: tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
LINE 690: between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
LINE 691: women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
LINE 692: poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
LINE 693: first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
LINE 694: sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan's daughter, Elizabeth, to use
LINE 695: granddaddy's words, wed her second, having killed her first.
LINE 696: O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in
LINE 697: royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
LINE 698: father's shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein
LINE 699: he has commended her to posterity.
LINE 700: He faced their silence.
LINE 701: To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.
LINE 702: But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
LINE 703: She was entitled to her widow's dower
LINE 704: At common law. His legal knowledge was great
LINE 705: Our judges tell us.
LINE 706: Him Satan fleers,
LINE 707: Mocker:
LINE 708: And therefore he left out her name
LINE 709: From the first draft but he did not leave out
LINE 710: The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
LINE 711: For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
LINE 712: And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
LINE 713: As I believe, to name her
LINE 714: He left her his
LINE 715: Secondbest
LINE 716: Bed.
LINE 717: _Punkt._
LINE 718: Leftherhis
LINE 719: Secondbest
LINE 720: Leftherhis
LINE 721: Bestabed
LINE 722: Secabest
LINE 723: Leftabed.
LINE 724: Woa!
LINE 725: —Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
LINE 726: they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
LINE 727: —He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and
LINE 728: landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
LINE 729: shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her
LINE 730: his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
LINE 731: peace?
LINE 732: —It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
LINE 733: Secondbest Best said finely.
LINE 734: —_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was
LINE 735: smiled on.
LINE 736: —Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.
LINE 737: Let me think.
LINE 738: —Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
LINE 739: Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
LINE 740: tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
LINE 741: dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don't forget
LINE 742: Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
LINE 743: —Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...
LINE 744: —He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for
LINE 745: a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
LINE 746: —What? asked Besteglinton.
LINE 747: William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people's William. For
LINE 748: terms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...
LINE 749: —Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought
LINE 750: of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his
LINE 751: hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those
LINE 752: days._ Lovely!
LINE 753: Catamite.
LINE 754: —The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
LINE 755: ugling Eglinton.
LINE 756: Steadfast John replied severe:
LINE 757: —The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake
LINE 758: and have it.
LINE 759: Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?
LINE 760: —And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his
LINE 761: own long pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself
LINE 762: a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the
LINE 763: famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship
LINE 764: mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.
LINE 765: He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted
LINE 766: his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could
LINE 767: Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to
LINE 768: his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging
LINE 769: and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being
LINE 770: plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_
LINE 771: with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn
LINE 772: for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in _Love's Labour Lost_.
LINE 773: His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking
LINE 774: enthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter's
LINE 775: theory of equivocation. The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and
LINE 776: the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American
LINE 777: cousin. The sugared sonnets follow Sidney's. As for fay Elizabeth,
LINE 778: otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives
LINE 779: of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for
LINE 780: deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.
LINE 781: I think you're getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of
LINE 782: theolologicophilolological. _Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._
LINE 783: —Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean
LINE 784: of studies holds he was a holy Roman.
LINE 785: _Sufflaminandus sum._
LINE 786: —He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French
LINE 787: polisher of Italian scandals.
LINE 788: —A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him
LINE 789: myriadminded.
LINE 790: _Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit
LINE 791: amicitia inter multos._
LINE 792: —Saint Thomas, Stephen began...
LINE 793: —_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.
LINE 794: There he keened a wailing rune.
LINE 795: —_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It's destroyed we are from this day!
LINE 796: It's destroyed we are surely!
LINE 797: All smiled their smiles.
LINE 798: —Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy
LINE 799: reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different
LINE 800: from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in
LINE 801: his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that
LINE 802: the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some
LINE 803: stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with
LINE 804: avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations
LINE 805: are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the
LINE 806: jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their
LINE 807: affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues
LINE 808: old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so
LINE 809: tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will
LINE 810: hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls
LINE 811: his wife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his
LINE 812: manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.
LINE 813: —Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.
LINE 814: —Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.
LINE 815: —Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.
LINE 816: —The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will's
LINE 817: widow, is the will to die.
LINE 818: _—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.
LINE 819: What of all the will to do?
LINE 820: It has vanished long ago...
LINE 821: —She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the
LINE 822: mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as
LINE 823: rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of
LINE 824: seven parishes. In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed
LINE 825: with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid
LINE 826: for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a
LINE 827: soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the
LINE 828: _Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she
LINE 829: thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches_ and _The most
LINE 830: Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_. Venus has
LINE 831: twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.
LINE 832: It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.
LINE 833: —History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_. The
LINE 834: ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man's
LINE 835: worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that
LINE 836: Russell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say
LINE 837: that only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family
LINE 838: man. I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.
LINE 839: Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping
LINE 840: with the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it
LINE 841: him. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there's a
LINE 842: gentleman to see you. Me? Says he's your father, sir. Give me my
LINE 843: Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in
LINE 844: strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with
LINE 845: clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.
LINE 846: Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.
LINE 847: Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I
LINE 848: touched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is
LINE 849: attending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.
LINE 850: —A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary
LINE 851: evil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father's death.
LINE 852: If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,
LINE 853: with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,
LINE 854: with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from
LINE 855: Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the
LINE 856: lustful queen. No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the
LINE 857: night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of
LINE 858: fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.
LINE 859: Boccaccio's Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
LINE 860: child. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to
LINE 861: man. It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only
LINE 862: begetter to only begotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which
LINE 863: the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is
LINE 864: founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro
LINE 865: and microcosm, upon the void. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.
LINE 866: _Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true
LINE 867: thing in life. Paternity may be a legal fiction. Who is the father of
LINE 868: any son that any son should love him or he any son?
LINE 869: What the hell are you driving at?
LINE 870: I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.
LINE 871: _Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea._
LINE 872: Are you condemned to do this?
LINE 873: —They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal
LINE 874: annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
LINE 875: hardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
LINE 876: lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
LINE 877: grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son
LINE 878: unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
LINE 879: care. He is a new male: his growth is his father's decline, his youth
LINE 880: his father's envy, his friend his father's enemy.
LINE 881: In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.
LINE 882: —What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.
LINE 883: Am I a father? If I were?
LINE 884: Shrunken uncertain hand.
LINE 885: —Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
LINE 886: field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of
LINE 887: Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the
LINE 888: father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
LINE 889: father be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another
LINE 890: poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not
LINE 891: the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and
LINE 892: felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own
LINE 893: grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,
LINE 894: never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors
LINE 895: perfection.
LINE 896: Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly
LINE 897: glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.
LINE 898: Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.
LINE 899: —Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with
LINE 900: child. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The
LINE 901: play's the thing! Let me parturiate!
LINE 902: He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.
LINE 903: —As for his family, Stephen said, his mother's name lives in the forest
LINE 904: of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in
LINE 905: _Coriolanus._ His boyson's death is the deathscene of young Arthur in
LINE 906: _King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the
LINE 907: girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter's Tale_ are we know.
LINE 908: Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may
LINE 909: guess. But there is another member of his family who is recorded.
LINE 910: —The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.
LINE 911: The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with
LINE 912: haste, quake, quack.
LINE 913: Door closed. Cell. Day.
LINE 914: They list. Three. They.
LINE 915: I you he they.
LINE 916: Come, mess.
LINE 917: STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in
LINE 918: his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister
LINE 919: Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the
LINE 920: playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on's back. The
LINE 921: playhouse sausage filled Gilbert's soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund
LINE 922: and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.
LINE 923: MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What's in a name?
LINE 924: BEST: That is my name, Richard, don't you know. I hope you are going to
LINE 925: say a good word for Richard, don't you know, for my sake. _(Laughter)_
LINE 926: BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_)
LINE 927: Then outspoke medical Dick
LINE 928: To his comrade medical Davy...
LINE 929: STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,
LINE 930: Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles'
LINE 931: names. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his
LINE 932: brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.
LINE 933: BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don't want Richard, my name
LINE 934: ...
LINE 935: _(Laughter)_
LINE 936: QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...
LINE 937: STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name,
LINE 938: William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old
LINE 939: Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it
LINE 940: in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o'Gaunt his
LINE 941: name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a
LINE 942: bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus,
LINE 943: dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What's in
LINE 944: a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the
LINE 945: name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at
LINE 946: his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in
LINE 947: the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the
LINE 948: recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the
LINE 949: stars. His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the
LINE 950: bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight
LINE 951: returning from Shottery and from her arms.
LINE 952: Both satisfied. I too.
LINE 953: Don't tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.
LINE 954: And from her arms.
LINE 955: Wait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?
LINE 956: Read the skies. _Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where's your
LINE 957: configuration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: _sua donna.
LINE 958: Già: di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amare S. D._
LINE 959: —What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a
LINE 960: celestial phenomenon?
LINE 961: —A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.
LINE 962: What more's to speak?
LINE 963: Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.
LINE 964: _Stephanos,_ my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my
LINE 965: feet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.
LINE 966: —You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is
LINE 967: strange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.
LINE 968: Me, Magee and Mulligan.
LINE 969: Fabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?
LINE 970: Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.
LINE 971: _Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing
LINE 972: be.
LINE 973: Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:
LINE 974: —That's very interesting because that brother motive, don't you know,
LINE 975: we find also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three
LINE 976: brothers Shakespeare. In Grimm too, don't you know, the fairytales. The
LINE 977: third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best
LINE 978: prize.
LINE 979: Best of Best brothers. Good, better, best.
LINE 980: The quaker librarian springhalted near.
LINE 981: —I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you
LINE 982: to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps
LINE 983: I am anticipating?
LINE 984: He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.
LINE 985: An attendant from the doorway called:
LINE 986: —Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...
LINE 987: —O, Father Dineen! Directly.
LINE 988: Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.
LINE 989: John Eglinton touched the foil.
LINE 990: —Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.
LINE 991: You kept them for the last, didn't you?
LINE 992: —In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
LINE 993: nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
LINE 994: brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.
LINE 995: Lapwing.
LINE 996: Where is your brother? Apothecaries' hall. My whetstone. Him, then
LINE 997: Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They
LINE 998: mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.
LINE 999: Lapwing.
LINE 1000: I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.
LINE 1001: On.
LINE 1002: —You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
LINE 1003: took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?
LINE 1004: Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
LINE 1005: (what's in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard
LINE 1006: the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The
LINE 1007: other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his
LINE 1008: kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare's reverence,
LINE 1009: the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
LINE 1010: Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney's _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to
LINE 1011: a Celtic legend older than history?
LINE 1012: —That was Will's way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine
LINE 1013: a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. _Que
LINE 1014: voulez-vous?_ Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and
LINE 1015: makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.
LINE 1016: —Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the
LINE 1017: usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
LINE 1018: Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of
LINE 1019: banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
LINE 1020: uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
LINE 1021: breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
LINE 1022: book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
LINE 1023: another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
LINE 1024: It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
LINE 1025: daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
LINE 1026: was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
LINE 1027: and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my
LINE 1028: lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,
LINE 1029: committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the
LINE 1030: lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
LINE 1031: which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it.
LINE 1032: Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety
LINE 1033: everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,
LINE 1034: twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure
LINE 1035: for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.
LINE 1036: He laughed to free his mind from his mind's bondage.
LINE 1037: Judge Eglinton summed up.
LINE 1038: —The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He
LINE 1039: is all in all.
LINE 1040: —He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
LINE 1041: All in all. In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold. He
LINE 1042: acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he
LINE 1043: kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
LINE 1044: ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.
LINE 1045: —Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
LINE 1046: Dark dome received, reverbed.
LINE 1047: —And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When
LINE 1048: all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right. After God
LINE 1049: Shakespeare has created most.
LINE 1050: —Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after
LINE 1051: a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
LINE 1052: always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
LINE 1053: life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The
LINE 1054: motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A
LINE 1055: king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what
LINE 1056: though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for,
LINE 1057: Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom
LINE 1058: they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it:
LINE 1059: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa's lump of
LINE 1060: love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the
LINE 1061: place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world
LINE 1062: without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck
LINE 1063: says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated
LINE 1064: on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps
LINE 1065: will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through
LINE 1066: ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives,
LINE 1067: widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright
LINE 1068: who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light
LINE 1069: first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom
LINE 1070: the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless
LINE 1071: all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and
LINE 1072: cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet,
LINE 1073: there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being
LINE 1074: a wife unto himself.
LINE 1075: _—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried. _Eureka!_
LINE 1076: Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton's
LINE 1077: desk.
LINE 1078: —May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.
LINE 1079: He began to scribble on a slip of paper.
LINE 1080: Take some slips from the counter going out.
LINE 1081: —Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one,
LINE 1082: shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.
LINE 1083: He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.
LINE 1084: Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
LINE 1085: variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._
LINE 1086: —You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have
LINE 1087: brought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe
LINE 1088: your own theory?
LINE 1089: —No, Stephen said promptly.
LINE 1090: —Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a
LINE 1091: dialogue, don't you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.
LINE 1092: John Eclecticon doubly smiled.
LINE 1093: —Well, in that case, he said, I don't see why you should expect payment
LINE 1094: for it since you don't believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is
LINE 1095: some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man
LINE 1096: Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
LINE 1097: that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
LINE 1098: visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
LINE 1099: wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he
LINE 1100: believes his theory.
LINE 1101: I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or
LINE 1102: help me to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? _Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?
LINE 1103: Other chap.
LINE 1104: —You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.
LINE 1105: Then I don't know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an
LINE 1106: article on economics.
LINE 1107: Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.
LINE 1108: —For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.
LINE 1109: Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
LINE 1110: gravely said, honeying malice:
LINE 1111: —I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
LINE 1112: Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa
LINE 1113: contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly
LINE 1114: and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.
LINE 1115: He broke away.
LINE 1116: —Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.
LINE 1117: Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts
LINE 1118: and offals.
LINE 1119: Stephen rose.
LINE 1120: Life is many days. This will end.
LINE 1121: —We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. _Notre ami_ Moore says
LINE 1122: Malachi Mulligan must be there.
LINE 1123: Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
LINE 1124: —Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
LINE 1125: Ireland. I'll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk
LINE 1126: straight?
LINE 1127: Laughing, he...
LINE 1128: Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
LINE 1129: Lubber...
LINE 1130: Stephen followed a lubber...
LINE 1131: One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His
LINE 1132: lub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.
LINE 1133: Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a
LINE 1134: wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering
LINE 1135: daylight of no thought.
LINE 1136: What have I learned? Of them? Of me?
LINE 1137: Walk like Haines now.
LINE 1138: The constant readers' room. In the readers' book Cashel Boyle O'Connor
LINE 1139: Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet
LINE 1140: mad? The quaker's pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.
LINE 1141: —O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...
LINE 1142: Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself,
LINE 1143: selfnodding:
LINE 1144: —A pleased bottom.
LINE 1145: The turnstile.
LINE 1146: Is that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...
LINE 1147: The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.
LINE 1148: Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
LINE 1149: John Eglinton, my jo, John,
LINE 1150: Why won't you wed a wife?
LINE 1151: He spluttered to the air:
LINE 1152: —O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their
LINE 1153: playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers' hall. Our players are creating a
LINE 1154: new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I
LINE 1155: smell the pubic sweat of monks.
LINE 1156: He spat blank.
LINE 1157: Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And
LINE 1158: left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born? And his
LINE 1159: first child a girl?
LINE 1160: Afterwit. Go back.
LINE 1161: The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,
LINE 1162: minion of pleasure, Phedo's toyable fair hair.
LINE 1163: Eh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...
LINE 1164: —Longworth and M'Curdy Atkinson were there...
LINE 1165: Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
LINE 1166: I hardly hear the purlieu cry
LINE 1167: Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
LINE 1168: Before my thoughts begin to run
LINE 1169: On F. M'Curdy Atkinson,
LINE 1170: The same that had the wooden leg
LINE 1171: And that filibustering filibeg
LINE 1172: That never dared to slake his drouth,
LINE 1173: Magee that had the chinless mouth.
LINE 1174: Being afraid to marry on earth
LINE 1175: They masturbated for all they were worth.
LINE 1176: Jest on. Know thyself.
LINE 1177: Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.
LINE 1178: —Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing
LINE 1179: black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are
LINE 1180: black.
LINE 1181: A laugh tripped over his lips.
LINE 1182: —Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that
LINE 1183: old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a
LINE 1184: job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.
LINE 1185: Couldn't you do the Yeats touch?
LINE 1186: He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
LINE 1187: —The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.
LINE 1188: One thinks of Homer.
LINE 1189: He stopped at the stairfoot.
LINE 1190: —I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.
LINE 1191: The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men's
LINE 1192: morrice with caps of indices.
LINE 1193: In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:
LINE 1194: _Everyman His Own Wife
LINE 1195: or
LINE 1196: A Honeymoon in the Hand
LINE 1197: (a national immorality in three orgasms)
LINE 1198: by
LINE 1199: Ballocky Mulligan._
LINE 1200: He turned a happy patch's smirk to Stephen, saying:
LINE 1201: —The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.
LINE 1202: He read, _marcato:_
LINE 1203: —Characters:
LINE 1204: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)
LINE 1205: CRAB (a bushranger)
LINE 1206: MEDICAL DICK )
LINE 1207: and ) (two birds with one stone)
LINE 1208: MEDICAL DAVY )
LINE 1209: MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)
LINE 1210: FRESH NELLY
LINE 1211: and
LINE 1212: ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).
LINE 1213: He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
LINE 1214: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
LINE 1215: —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift
LINE 1216: their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
LINE 1217: multicoloured, multitudinous vomit!
LINE 1218: —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted
LINE 1219: them.
LINE 1220: About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.
LINE 1221: Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,
LINE 1222: if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must
LINE 1223: come to, ineluctably.
LINE 1224: My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.
LINE 1225: A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.
LINE 1226: —Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.
LINE 1227: The portico.
LINE 1228: Here I watched the birds for augury. Ængus of the birds. They go, they
LINE 1229: come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots
LINE 1230: after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.
LINE 1231: —The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown's awe. Did you
LINE 1232: see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient
LINE 1233: mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.
LINE 1234: Manner of Oxenford.
LINE 1235: Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.
LINE 1236: A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,
LINE 1237: under portcullis barbs.
LINE 1238: They followed.
LINE 1239: Offend me still. Speak on.
LINE 1240: Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds.
LINE 1241: Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in
LINE 1242: a flaw of softness softly were blown.
LINE 1243: Cease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:
LINE 1244: from wide earth an altar.
LINE 1245: Laud we the gods
LINE 1246: And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
LINE 1247: From our bless'd altars.
