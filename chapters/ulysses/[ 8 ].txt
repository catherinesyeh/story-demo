LINE 1: Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugarsticky girl
LINE 2: shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school
LINE 3: treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His
LINE 4: Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red
LINE 5: jujubes white.
LINE 6: A sombre Y. M. C. A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of
LINE 7: Graham Lemon's, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.
LINE 8: Heart to heart talks.
LINE 9: Bloo... Me? No.
LINE 10: Blood of the Lamb.
LINE 11: His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are
LINE 12: washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,
LINE 13: martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,
LINE 14: druids' altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of
LINE 15: the church in Zion is coming.
LINE 16: Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!!
LINE 17: All heartily welcome.
LINE 18: Paying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put
LINE 19: the stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the
LINE 20: luminous crucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see
LINE 21: him on the wall, hanging. Pepper's ghost idea. Iron Nails Ran In.
LINE 22: Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for
LINE 23: instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to
LINE 24: the pantry in the kitchen. Don't like all the smells in it waiting to
LINE 25: rush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of
LINE 26: Spain. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny.
LINE 27: Very good for the brain.
LINE 28: From Butler's monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor's walk.
LINE 29: Dedalus' daughter there still outside Dillon's auctionrooms. Must be
LINE 30: selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.
LINE 31: Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother
LINE 32: goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their
LINE 33: theology or the priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the
LINE 34: absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat
LINE 35: you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on
LINE 36: the fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I'd like to see them
LINE 37: do the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for
LINE 38: fear he'd collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows
LINE 39: if you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting
LINE 40: £. s. d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one.
LINE 41: Watching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence:
LINE 42: mum's the word.
LINE 43: Good Lord, that poor child's dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks
LINE 44: too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It's after they feel it.
LINE 45: Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.
LINE 46: As he set foot on O'Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from
LINE 47: the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours
LINE 48: it, I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see
LINE 49: the brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats
LINE 50: get in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead
LINE 51: drunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians.
LINE 52: Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the
LINE 53: things.
LINE 54: Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt
LINE 55: quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben
LINE 56: J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and
LINE 57: eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the
LINE 58: things. Knows how to tell a story too.
LINE 59: They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.
LINE 60: He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet
LINE 61: per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of
LINE 62: swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the
LINE 63: day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the
LINE 64: wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.
LINE 65: The hungry famished gull
LINE 66: Flaps o'er the waters dull.
LINE 67: That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has
LINE 68: no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts.
LINE 69: Solemn.
LINE 70: Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit
LINE 71: Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.
LINE 72: —Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!
LINE 73: His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.
LINE 74: Australians they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them
LINE 75: up with a rag or a handkerchief.
LINE 76: Wait. Those poor birds.
LINE 77: He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes
LINE 78: for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down
LINE 79: into the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all
LINE 80: from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.
LINE 81: Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his
LINE 82: hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they
LINE 83: have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down
LINE 84: here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder
LINE 85: what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.
LINE 86: They wheeled flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny
LINE 87: quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and
LINE 88: mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes
LINE 89: like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are
LINE 90: not salty? How is that?
LINE 91: His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor
LINE 92: on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.
LINE 93: Kino's
LINE 94: 11/—
LINE 95: Trousers
LINE 96: Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you
LINE 97: own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same,
LINE 98: which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All
LINE 99: kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used
LINE 100: to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly
LINE 101: confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the
LINE 102: dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or
LINE 103: stick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen
LINE 104: a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110
LINE 105: PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.
LINE 106: If he...?
LINE 107: O!
LINE 108: Eh?
LINE 109: No... No.
LINE 110: No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?
LINE 111: No, no.
LINE 112: Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about
LINE 113: that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.
LINE 114: Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never
LINE 115: exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek:
LINE 116: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her
LINE 117: about the transmigration. O rocks!
LINE 118: Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She's
LINE 119: right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the
LINE 120: sound. She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was
LINE 121: thinking. Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base
LINE 122: barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was
LINE 123: singing into a barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big
LINE 124: Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an
LINE 125: albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at
LINE 126: stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.
LINE 127: A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him
LINE 128: along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like
LINE 129: that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He
LINE 130: read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.
LINE 131: Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his
LINE 132: foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our
LINE 133: staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after
LINE 134: street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are
LINE 135: not Boyl: no, M'Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either. I
LINE 136: suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls
LINE 137: sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I
LINE 138: bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the
LINE 139: eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of
LINE 140: them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women
LINE 141: too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he
LINE 142: didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a
LINE 143: false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's
LINE 144: potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em.
LINE 145: What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop,
LINE 146: Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser
LINE 147: _Kansell,_ sold by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I
LINE 148: am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.
LINE 149: Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.
LINE 150: Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed
LINE 151: in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I
LINE 152: disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate
LINE 153: with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of
LINE 154: Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by
LINE 155: the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they
LINE 156: really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the
LINE 157: same. No lard for them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like
LINE 158: buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister?
LINE 159: Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented
LINE 160: barbed wire.
LINE 161: He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover
LINE 162: cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil
LINE 163: Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom's. Got
LINE 164: the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago:
LINE 165: ninetyfour he died yes that's right the big fire at Arnott's. Val
LINE 166: Dillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly
LINE 167: emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it
LINE 168: for the inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we
LINE 169: have already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then.
LINE 170: Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored
LINE 171: with selfcovered buttons. She didn't like it because I sprained my
LINE 172: ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old
LINE 173: Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies' picnic too.
LINE 174: Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,
LINE 175: shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we
LINE 176: had that day. People looking after her.
LINE 177: Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.
LINE 178: Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American
LINE 179: soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she
LINE 180: looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's
LINE 181: daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.
LINE 182: He walked along the curbstone.
LINE 183: Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was
LINE 184: always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in
LINE 185: Citron's saint Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is
LINE 186: getting. Pen ...? Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams
LINE 187: probably. Well, if he couldn't remember the dayfather's name that he
LINE 188: sees every day.
LINE 189: Bartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
LINE 190: after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her
LINE 191: that song _Winds that blow from the south_.
LINE 192: Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting
LINE 193: on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the
LINE 194: supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of
LINE 195: her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky
LINE 196: it didn't. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.
LINE 197: Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old
LINE 198: sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage.
LINE 199: May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the
LINE 200: wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that
LINE 201: gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old
LINE 202: Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home
LINE 203: raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her
LINE 204: supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see
LINE 205: her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays:
LINE 206: white.
LINE 207: Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.
LINE 208: Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two
LINE 209: taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.
LINE 210: That was the night...
LINE 211: —O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?
LINE 212: —O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?
LINE 213: —No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for
LINE 214: ages.
LINE 215: —In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in
LINE 216: Mullingar, you know.
LINE 217: —Go away! Isn't that grand for her?
LINE 218: —Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How
LINE 219: are all your charges?
LINE 220: —All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.
LINE 221: How many has she? No other in sight.
LINE 222: —You're in black, I see. You have no...
LINE 223: —No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.
LINE 224: Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he
LINE 225: die of? Turn up like a bad penny.
LINE 226: —O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.
LINE 227: May as well get her sympathy.
LINE 228: —Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,
LINE 229: poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.
LINE 230: Your funeral's tomorrow
LINE 231: While you're coming through the rye.
LINE 232: Diddlediddle dumdum
LINE 233: Diddlediddle...
LINE 234: —Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.
LINE 235: Now that's quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.
LINE 236: —And your lord and master?
LINE 237: Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.
LINE 238: —O, don't be talking! she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's in
LINE 239: there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me
LINE 240: heartscalded. Wait till I show you.
LINE 241: Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured
LINE 242: out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's
LINE 243: gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
LINE 244: or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab
LINE 245: stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of
LINE 246: hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork
LINE 247: chained to the table.
LINE 248: Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on
LINE 249: those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.
LINE 250: Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.
LINE 251: Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are
LINE 252: you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief:
LINE 253: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...
LINE 254: —There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you
LINE 255: know what he did last night?
LINE 256: Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in
LINE 257: alarm, yet smiling.
LINE 258: —What? Mr Bloom asked.
LINE 259: Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.
LINE 260: —Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.
LINE 261: Indiges.
LINE 262: —Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.
LINE 263: —The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
LINE 264: She took a folded postcard from her handbag.
LINE 265: —Read that, she said. He got it this morning.
LINE 266: —What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U. P.?
LINE 267: —U. p: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great
LINE 268: shame for them whoever he is.
LINE 269: —Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 270: She took back the card, sighing.
LINE 271: —And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an
LINE 272: action for ten thousand pounds, he says.
LINE 273: She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.
LINE 274: Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen
LINE 275: its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three
LINE 276: old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a
LINE 277: tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than
LINE 278: Molly.
LINE 279: See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.
LINE 280: He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.
LINE 281: Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of
LINE 282: pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her
LINE 283: cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie
LINE 284: Powell that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the
LINE 285: charades. U. p: up.
LINE 286: Change the subject.
LINE 287: —Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.
LINE 288: —Mina Purefoy? she said.
LINE 289: Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of
LINE 290: the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.
LINE 291: —Yes.
LINE 292: —I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the
LINE 293: lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three
LINE 294: days bad now.
LINE 295: —O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.
LINE 296: —Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff
LINE 297: birth, the nurse told me.
LINE 298: —O, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 299: His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in
LINE 300: compassion. Dth! Dth!
LINE 301: —I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's
LINE 302: terrible for her.
LINE 303: Mrs Breen nodded.
LINE 304: —She was taken bad on the Tuesday...
LINE 305: Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
LINE 306: —Mind! Let this man pass.
LINE 307: A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
LINE 308: rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a
LINE 309: skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,
LINE 310: a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.
LINE 311: —Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts.
LINE 312: Watch!
LINE 313: —Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?
LINE 314: —His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr
LINE 315: Bloom said smiling. Watch!
LINE 316: —He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these
LINE 317: days.
LINE 318: She broke off suddenly.
LINE 319: —There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to
LINE 320: Molly, won't you?
LINE 321: —I will, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 322: He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis
LINE 323: Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of
LINE 324: Harrison's hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay.
LINE 325: Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and
LINE 326: thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he
LINE 327: spoke earnestly.
LINE 328: Meshuggah. Off his chump.
LINE 329: Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the
LINE 330: tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two
LINE 331: days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.
LINE 332: And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have
LINE 333: with him.
LINE 334: U. p: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote
LINE 335: it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton's
LINE 336: office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the
LINE 337: gods.
LINE 338: He passed the _Irish Times_. There might be other answers lying there.
LINE 339: Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their
LINE 340: lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them
LINE 341: there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them.
LINE 342: Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called
LINE 343: you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell
LINE 344: me what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife.
LINE 345: Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you.
LINE 346: And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good
LINE 347: fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo.
LINE 348: Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of
LINE 349: poetry.
LINE 350: Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook
LINE 351: and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit
LINE 352: counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork
LINE 353: shop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made
LINE 354: a big deal on Coates's shares. Ca' canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All
LINE 355: the toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the _Irish
LINE 356: Field_ now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement
LINE 357: and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement
LINE 358: yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects
LINE 359: juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse
LINE 360: like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her,
LINE 361: not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood
LINE 362: mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss
LINE 363: off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the
LINE 364: Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or
LINE 365: fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it
LINE 366: out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that
LINE 367: sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel.
LINE 368: Divorced Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling
LINE 369: them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when
LINE 370: Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the _Express._
LINE 371: Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the
LINE 372: plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few
LINE 373: weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work
LINE 374: for her, thanks.
LINE 375: Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun
LINE 376: and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating
LINE 377: with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his
LINE 378: muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore's
LINE 379: cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy
LINE 380: annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers
LINE 381: marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a
LINE 382: marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast
LINE 383: year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are. Dog in
LINE 384: the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.
LINE 385: He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at
LINE 386: Rowe's? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in
LINE 387: the Burton. Better. On my way.
LINE 388: He walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot
LINE 389: to tap Tom Kernan.
LINE 390: Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a
LINE 391: vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew!
LINE 392: Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her
LINE 393: trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me
LINE 394: that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent
LINE 395: something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea:
LINE 396: queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman
LINE 397: that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was
LINE 398: consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the
LINE 399: what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to
LINE 400: feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing
LINE 401: quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at
LINE 402: compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings
LINE 403: and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage
LINE 404: people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years
LINE 405: want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.
LINE 406: Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for
LINE 407: nothing.
LINE 408: Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs
LINE 409: Moisel. Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then
LINE 410: returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes.
LINE 411: Weight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my
LINE 412: babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O,
LINE 413: that's nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first
LINE 414: bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People
LINE 415: knocking them up at all hours. For God' sake, doctor. Wife in her
LINE 416: throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on
LINE 417: your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.
LINE 418: Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of
LINE 419: pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I
LINE 420: pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be
LINE 421: thrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the
LINE 422: trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.
LINE 423: A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian
LINE 424: file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their
LINE 425: truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their
LINE 426: belts. Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and
LINE 427: scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment
LINE 428: to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of
LINE 429: others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the
LINE 430: station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare
LINE 431: to receive soup.
LINE 432: He crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put
LINE 433: him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for
LINE 434: women. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. _There is not in
LINE 435: this wide world a vallee_. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice
LINE 436: up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?
LINE 437: He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack
LINE 438: Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them
LINE 439: trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the
LINE 440: bridewell. Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially
LINE 441: the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was
LINE 442: given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did!
LINE 443: His horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had
LINE 444: the presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did
LINE 445: come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the
LINE 446: cobblestones. I oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those
LINE 447: medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for
LINE 448: trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting
LINE 449: for me in the Mater and now he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy.
LINE 450: Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled.
LINE 451: Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.
LINE 452: —Up the Boers!
LINE 453: —Three cheers for De Wet!
LINE 454: —We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.
LINE 455: Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.
LINE 456: The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and
LINE 457: civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows
LINE 458: used to. Whether on the scaffold high.
LINE 459: Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in
LINE 460: his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on
LINE 461: the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to
LINE 462: get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the
LINE 463: castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are
LINE 464: always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform.
LINE 465: Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next
LINE 466: thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was
LINE 467: the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole.
LINE 468: Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms
LINE 469: ironing.
LINE 470: —Are those yours, Mary?
LINE 471: —I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you. Out
LINE 472: half the night.
LINE 473: —There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.
LINE 474: —Ah, gelong with your great times coming.
LINE 475: Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.
LINE 476: James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that
LINE 477: a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out
LINE 478: you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey's
LINE 479: daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the
LINE 480: Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.
LINE 481: You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a
LINE 482: squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about
LINE 483: our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom.
LINE 484: Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government.
LINE 485: That the language question should take precedence of the economic
LINE 486: question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them
LINE 487: up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme
LINE 488: seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease
LINE 489: before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk
LINE 490: with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap
LINE 491: pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show
LINE 492: us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day.
LINE 493: Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.
LINE 494: His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,
LINE 495: shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing,
LINE 496: outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day:
LINE 497: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies
LINE 498: mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed
LINE 499: groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second
LINE 500: somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five
LINE 501: minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born,
LINE 502: washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling
LINE 503: maaaaaa.
LINE 504: Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other
LINE 505: coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of
LINE 506: pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that.
LINE 507: Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets
LINE 508: his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have
LINE 509: all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away
LINE 510: age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves
LINE 511: Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble,
LINE 512: sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of
LINE 513: breeze. Shelter, for the night.
LINE 514: No-one is anything.
LINE 515: This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate
LINE 516: this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.
LINE 517: Provost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in
LINE 518: there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me.
LINE 519: Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.
LINE 520: The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the
LINE 521: silverware opposite in Walter Sexton's window by which John Howard
LINE 522: Parnell passed, unseeing.
LINE 523: There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a
LINE 524: coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't
LINE 525: meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a
LINE 526: corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's
LINE 527: uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his
LINE 528: high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the
LINE 529: woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a
LINE 530: pain. Great man's brother: his brother's brother. He'd look nice on the
LINE 531: city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess
LINE 532: there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to
LINE 533: pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That's the
LINE 534: fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other
LINE 535: sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright
LINE 536: like surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath.
LINE 537: Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The
LINE 538: patriot's banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said
LINE 539: when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the
LINE 540: grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.
LINE 541: —Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which
LINE 542: the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks
LINE 543: with a Scotch accent. The tentacles...
LINE 544: They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and
LINE 545: bicycle. Young woman.
LINE 546: And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time.
LINE 547: Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the
LINE 548: eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.
LINE 549: E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur
LINE 550: Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the
LINE 551: world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult:
LINE 552: symbolism. Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To
LINE 553: aid gentleman in literary work.
LINE 554: His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a
LINE 555: listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only
LINE 556: weggebobbles and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of
LINE 557: that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it's healthier.
LINE 558: Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a
LINE 559: bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me
LINE 560: nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating
LINE 561: rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by
LINE 562: the tap all night.
LINE 563: Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.
LINE 564: Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy,
LINE 565: symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that
LINE 566: kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.
LINE 567: For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their
LINE 568: shirts you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know
LINE 569: what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.
LINE 570: The dreamy cloudy gull
LINE 571: Waves o'er the waters dull.
LINE 572: He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of
LINE 573: Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old
LINE 574: Harris's and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow.
LINE 575: Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right.
LINE 576: Goerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on
LINE 577: easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in
LINE 578: the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave
LINE 579: behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about?
LINE 580: Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up
LINE 581: that farmer's daughter's bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.
LINE 582: Unclaimed money too. There's a little watch up there on the roof of the
LINE 583: bank to test those glasses by.
LINE 584: His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If
LINE 585: you imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.
LINE 586: He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right
LINE 587: hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes:
LINE 588: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk.
LINE 589: Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.
LINE 590: Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were
LINE 591: in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific
LINE 592: explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn
LINE 593: some time.
LINE 594: Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's
LINE 595: the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there
LINE 596: some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to
LINE 597: professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do
LINE 598: to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected.
LINE 599: Nobleman proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His
LINE 600: foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land.
LINE 601: Not go in and blurt out what you know you're not to: what's parallax?
LINE 602: Show this gentleman the door.
LINE 603: Ah.
LINE 604: His hand fell to his side again.
LINE 605: Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,
LINE 606: crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then
LINE 607: solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen
LINE 608: rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she
LINE 609: said. I believe there is.
LINE 610: He went on by la maison Claire.
LINE 611: Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly
LINE 612: there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview
LINE 613: moon. She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other
LINE 614: side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love.
LINE 615: Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.
LINE 616: Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.
LINE 617: Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.
LINE 618: With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here
LINE 619: middle of the day of Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,
LINE 620: M'Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or _cherchez la
LINE 621: femme_. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the
LINE 622: rest of the year sober as a judge.
LINE 623: Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him
LINE 624: good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the
LINE 625: Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon
LINE 626: face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies,
LINE 627: eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking,
LINE 628: laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat.
LINE 629: Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white
LINE 630: hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp
LINE 631: that once did starve us all.
LINE 632: I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was.
LINE 633: She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed.
LINE 634: Could never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like
LINE 635: holding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning
LINE 636: then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty
LINE 637: boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the
LINE 638: library.
LINE 639: Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,
LINE 640: silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in
LINE 641: the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings.
LINE 642: Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef
LINE 643: to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out
LINE 644: of plumb.
LINE 645: He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers.
LINE 646: Cascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its
LINE 647: mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots
LINE 648: brought that here. _La causa è santa!_ Tara tara. Great chorus that.
LINE 649: Taree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.
LINE 650: Pincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all
LINE 651: over the place. Needles in window curtains.
LINE 652: He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today
LINE 653: anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps.
LINE 654: Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't
LINE 655: like it. Women won't pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.
LINE 656: Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk
LINE 657: stockings.
LINE 658: Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.
LINE 659: High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home
LINE 660: and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath
LINE 661: Netaim. Wealth of the world.
LINE 662: A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.
LINE 663: Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he
LINE 664: mutely craved to adore.
LINE 665: Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.
LINE 666: He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.
LINE 667: Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer
LINE 668: fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements,
LINE 669: along sofas, creaking beds.
LINE 670: —Jack, love!
LINE 671: —Darling!
LINE 672: —Kiss me, Reggy!
LINE 673: —My boy!
LINE 674: —Love!
LINE 675: His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink
LINE 676: gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See
LINE 677: the animals feed.
LINE 678: Men, men, men.
LINE 679: Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables
LINE 680: calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy
LINE 681: food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced
LINE 682: young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.
LINE 683: New set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked
LINE 684: round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back
LINE 685: on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew
LINE 686: it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's
LINE 687: eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves
LINE 688: as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw.
LINE 689: Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the
LINE 690: schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what
LINE 691: he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to
LINE 692: Christianity. Couldn't swallow it all however.
LINE 693: —Roast beef and cabbage.
LINE 694: —One stew.
LINE 695: Smells of men. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek
LINE 696: of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale of ferment.
LINE 697: His gorge rose.
LINE 698: Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all
LINE 699: before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing
LINE 700: the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then
LINE 701: on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it
LINE 702: off the plate, man! Get out of this.
LINE 703: He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of
LINE 704: his nose.
LINE 705: —Two stouts here.
LINE 706: —One corned and cabbage.
LINE 707: That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended
LINE 708: on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his
LINE 709: three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a
LINE 710: silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means
LINE 711: born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.
LINE 712: An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head
LINE 713: bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.
LINE 714: Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork
LINE 715: upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the
LINE 716: foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him
LINE 717: something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I
LINE 718: munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?
LINE 719: Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:
LINE 720: —Not here. Don't see him.
LINE 721: Out. I hate dirty eaters.
LINE 722: He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap.
LINE 723: Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.
LINE 724: —Roast and mashed here.
LINE 725: —Pint of stout.
LINE 726: Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.
LINE 727: He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street.
LINE 728: Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!
LINE 729: Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down
LINE 730: with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the
LINE 731: street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every
LINE 732: mother's son don't talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women
LINE 733: and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From
LINE 734: Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union,
LINE 735: lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My
LINE 736: plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir
LINE 737: Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes with your
LINE 738: handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O'Flynn
LINE 739: would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number
LINE 740: one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as
LINE 741: big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of
LINE 742: it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel _table d'hôte_ she
LINE 743: called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're
LINE 744: chewing. Then who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all
LINE 745: feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.
LINE 746: After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from
LINE 747: the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp
LINE 748: of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw
LINE 749: fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe
LINE 750: to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering
LINE 751: bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that
LINE 752: brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed
LINE 753: sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling
LINE 754: nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces,
LINE 755: young one.
LINE 756: Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.
LINE 757: Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.
LINE 758: Ah, I'm hungry.
LINE 759: He entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now
LINE 760: and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.
LINE 761: What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?
LINE 762: —Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.
LINE 763: —Hello, Flynn.
LINE 764: —How's things?
LINE 765: —Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.
LINE 766: Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham
LINE 767: and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is
LINE 768: home without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad!
LINE 769: Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's
LINE 770: potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too
LINE 771: salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of
LINE 772: honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch
LINE 773: the effect. _There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something
LINE 774: the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger_. With it an abode of
LINE 775: bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked
LINE 776: and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together.
LINE 777: Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of
LINE 778: inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions.
LINE 779: Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be
LINE 780: merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all
LINE 781: but itself. Mity cheese.
LINE 782: —Have you a cheese sandwich?
LINE 783: —Yes, sir.
LINE 784: Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of
LINE 785: burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,
LINE 786: Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served
LINE 787: me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God
LINE 788: made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.
LINE 789: —Wife well?
LINE 790: —Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
LINE 791: —Yes, sir.
LINE 792: Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.
LINE 793: —Doing any singing those times?
LINE 794: Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.
LINE 795: Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.
LINE 796: Does no harm. Free ad.
LINE 797: —She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard
LINE 798: perhaps.
LINE 799: —No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?
LINE 800: The curate served.
LINE 801: —How much is that?
LINE 802: —Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.
LINE 803: Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. _Mr MacTrigger_. Easier
LINE 804: than the dreamy creamy stuff. _His five hundred wives. Had the time of
LINE 805: their lives._
LINE 806: —Mustard, sir?
LINE 807: —Thank you.
LINE 808: He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. _Their lives_. I have
LINE 809: it. _It grew bigger and bigger and bigger_.
LINE 810: —Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part
LINE 811: shares and part profits.
LINE 812: —Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket
LINE 813: to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan
LINE 814: mixed up in it?
LINE 815: A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He
LINE 816: raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock
LINE 817: five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.
LINE 818: His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,
LINE 819: longingly.
LINE 820: Wine.
LINE 821: He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to
LINE 822: speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.
LINE 823: —Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.
LINE 824: No fear: no brains.
LINE 825: Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.
LINE 826: —He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that
LINE 827: boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello
LINE 828: barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he
LINE 829: was telling me...
LINE 830: Hope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.
LINE 831: —For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God
LINE 832: till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is
LINE 833: a hairy chap.
LINE 834: Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
LINE 835: cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose
LINE 836: smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat
LINE 837: on the parsnips.
LINE 838: —And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give
LINE 839: us a good one for the Gold cup?
LINE 840: —I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a
LINE 841: horse.
LINE 842: —You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.
LINE 843: Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
LINE 844: disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his
LINE 845: wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather
LINE 846: with the chill off.
LINE 847: Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like
LINE 848: the way it curves there.
LINE 849: —I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined
LINE 850: many a man, the same horses.
LINE 851: Vintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits
LINE 852: for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.
LINE 853: —True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no
LINE 854: straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving
LINE 855: Sceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden's, won
LINE 856: at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one
LINE 857: against Saint Amant a fortnight before.
LINE 858: —That so? Davy Byrne said...
LINE 859: He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned
LINE 860: its pages.
LINE 861: —I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of
LINE 862: horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,
LINE 863: Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow
LINE 864: cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off
LINE 865: it. Ay.
LINE 866: He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the
LINE 867: flutes.
LINE 868: —Ay, he said, sighing.
LINE 869: Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.
LINE 870: Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him
LINE 871: forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down
LINE 872: again. Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like.
LINE 873: Prickly beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the
LINE 874: rumbling stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling
LINE 875: him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!
LINE 876: Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish
LINE 877: cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath
LINE 878: of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can.
LINE 879: Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...
LINE 880: Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off
LINE 881: colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy
LINE 882: lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of
LINE 883: shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the
LINE 884: French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn
LINE 885: nothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything
LINE 886: into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you
LINE 887: think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so
LINE 888: on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting
LINE 889: fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need
LINE 890: artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters.
LINE 891: Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too.
LINE 892: Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank
LINE 893: oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this
LINE 894: morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed
LINE 895: no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high.
LINE 896: Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs
LINE 897: fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each
LINE 898: dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That
LINE 899: archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs?
LINE 900: Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch
LINE 901: in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the
LINE 902: fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half
LINE 903: the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price.
LINE 904: Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses.
LINE 905: Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The _élite. Crème de
LINE 906: la crème_. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a
LINE 907: platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat
LINE 908: with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to
LINE 909: venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow.
LINE 910: Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted
LINE 911: _chef_ like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage _à la duchesse de
LINE 912: Parme_. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know
LINE 913: what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself.
LINE 914: Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them.
LINE 915: Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a
LINE 916: waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I
LINE 917: tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do
LINE 918: bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat
LINE 919: lived in Killiney, I remember. _Du de la_ is French. Still it's the
LINE 920: same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out
LINE 921: of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his
LINE 922: name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth
LINE 923: twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth
LINE 924: fifty thousand pounds.
LINE 925: Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.
LINE 926: Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the
LINE 927: winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch
LINE 928: telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under
LINE 929: wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The
LINE 930: bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards
LINE 931: Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried
LINE 932: cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather
LINE 933: scrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft
LINE 934: with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not
LINE 935: turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her
LINE 936: mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and
LINE 937: chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle.
LINE 938: Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft
LINE 939: warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing
LINE 940: eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth
LINE 941: rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.
LINE 942: Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her,
LINE 943: kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts
LINE 944: full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued
LINE 945: her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair.
LINE 946: Kissed, she kissed me.
LINE 947: Me. And me now.
LINE 948: Stuck, the flies buzzed.
LINE 949: His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab.
LINE 950: Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno:
LINE 951: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the
LINE 952: round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what
LINE 953: man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like
LINE 954: Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first?
LINE 955: Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods
LINE 956: golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled
LINE 957: mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it
LINE 958: drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped
LINE 959: Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out
LINE 960: behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like
LINE 961: stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper
LINE 962: won't see. Bend down let something fall see if she.
LINE 963: Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do
LINE 964: there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and
LINE 965: walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men
LINE 966: lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.
LINE 967: When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
LINE 968: —What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?
LINE 969: —He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for
LINE 970: the _Freeman._
LINE 971: —I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?
LINE 972: —Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?
LINE 973: —I noticed he was in mourning.
LINE 974: —Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at
LINE 975: home. You're right, by God. So he was.
LINE 976: —I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
LINE 977: gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their
LINE 978: minds.
LINE 979: —It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
LINE 980: yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's
LINE 981: wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
LINE 982: to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.
LINE 983: —And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.
LINE 984: Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.
LINE 985: —He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of
LINE 986: that.
LINE 987: —How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
LINE 988: Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He
LINE 989: winked.
LINE 990: —He's in the craft, he said.
LINE 991: —Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
LINE 992: —Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's
LINE 993: an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg
LINE 994: up. I was told that by a—well, I won't say who.
LINE 995: —Is that a fact?
LINE 996: —O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're
LINE 997: down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close
LINE 998: as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
LINE 999: Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
LINE 1000: —Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
LINE 1001: —There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
LINE 1002: out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and
LINE 1003: swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint
LINE 1004: Legers of Doneraile.
LINE 1005: Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
LINE 1006: —And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here
LINE 1007: and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.
LINE 1008: —God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips
LINE 1009: off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch?
LINE 1010: Ah, you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he
LINE 1011: does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to
LINE 1012: God he does.
LINE 1013: —There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.
LINE 1014: —He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known
LINE 1015: to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O,
LINE 1016: Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.
LINE 1017: His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
LINE 1018: —I know, Davy Byrne said.
LINE 1019: —Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
LINE 1020: Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,
LINE 1021: a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
LINE 1022: —Day, Mr Byrne.
LINE 1023: —Day, gentlemen.
LINE 1024: They paused at the counter.
LINE 1025: —Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.
LINE 1026: —I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
LINE 1027: —Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.
LINE 1028: —I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
LINE 1029: —How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's
LINE 1030: yours, Tom?
LINE 1031: —How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
LINE 1032: For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
LINE 1033: hiccupped.
LINE 1034: —Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
LINE 1035: —Certainly, sir.
LINE 1036: Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
LINE 1037: —Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold
LINE 1038: water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.
LINE 1039: He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.
LINE 1040: —Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
LINE 1041: Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set
LINE 1042: before him.
LINE 1043: —That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
LINE 1044: —Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
LINE 1045: Tom Rochford nodded and drank.
LINE 1046: —Is it Zinfandel?
LINE 1047: —Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my
LINE 1048: own.
LINE 1049: —Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
LINE 1050: said. Who gave it to you?
LINE 1051: Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
LINE 1052: —So long! Nosey Flynn said.
LINE 1053: The others turned.
LINE 1054: —That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
LINE 1055: —Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two
LINE 1056: of your small Jamesons after that and a...
LINE 1057: —Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
LINE 1058: —Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.
LINE 1059: Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
LINE 1060: smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with
LINE 1061: those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.
LINE 1062: At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
LINE 1063: cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks
LINE 1064: having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom
LINE 1065: coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they
LINE 1066: move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of
LINE 1067: his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long
LINE 1068: mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and
LINE 1069: invent free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.
LINE 1070: He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
LINE 1071: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
LINE 1072: M'invitasti.
LINE 1073: Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap
LINE 1074: in the blues. Dutch courage. That _Kilkenny People_ in the national
LINE 1075: library now I must.
LINE 1076: Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller,
LINE 1077: plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way
LINE 1078: down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour
LINE 1079: round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric
LINE 1080: juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to
LINE 1081: stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.
LINE 1082: —_A cenar teco._
LINE 1083: What does that _teco_ mean? Tonight perhaps.
LINE 1084: Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
LINE 1085: To come to supper tonight,
LINE 1086: The rum the rumdum.
LINE 1087: Doesn't go properly.
LINE 1088: Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about
LINE 1089: two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks
LINE 1090: van over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas
LINE 1091: about. On the pig's back.
LINE 1092: Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
LINE 1093: garters.
LINE 1094: Today. Today. Not think.
LINE 1095: Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,
LINE 1096: Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely
LINE 1097: seaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy
LINE 1098: thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.
LINE 1099: Will eat anything.
LINE 1100: Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and
LINE 1101: passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. _Why I left the
LINE 1102: church of Rome? Birds' Nest._ Women run him. They say they used to give
LINE 1103: pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato
LINE 1104: blight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor
LINE 1105: jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.
LINE 1106: A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No
LINE 1107: tram in sight. Wants to cross.
LINE 1108: —Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
LINE 1109: The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He
LINE 1110: moved his head uncertainly.
LINE 1111: —You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.
LINE 1112: Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.
LINE 1113: The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its
LINE 1114: line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I
LINE 1115: saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in
LINE 1116: John Long's. Slaking his drouth.
LINE 1117: —There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you
LINE 1118: across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
LINE 1119: —Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.
LINE 1120: —Come, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 1121: He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
LINE 1122: guide it forward.
LINE 1123: Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust
LINE 1124: what you tell them. Pass a common remark.
LINE 1125: —The rain kept off.
LINE 1126: No answer.
LINE 1127: Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different
LINE 1128: for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like
LINE 1129: Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if
LINE 1130: he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired
LINE 1131: drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a
LINE 1132: horse.
LINE 1133: —Thanks, sir.
LINE 1134: Knows I'm a man. Voice.
LINE 1135: —Right now? First turn to the left.
LINE 1136: The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
LINE 1137: his cane back, feeling again.
LINE 1138: Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
LINE 1139: tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?
LINE 1140: Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
LINE 1141: of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.
LINE 1142: Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer
LINE 1143: idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could
LINE 1144: he walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like
LINE 1145: a fellow going in to be a priest.
LINE 1146: Penrose! That was that chap's name.
LINE 1147: Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.
LINE 1148: Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a
LINE 1149: deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might
LINE 1150: say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets.
LINE 1151: People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday.
LINE 1152: Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
LINE 1153: Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched
LINE 1154: together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the
LINE 1155: spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with
LINE 1156: your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say
LINE 1157: get no pleasure.
LINE 1158: And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl
LINE 1159: passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have
LINE 1160: them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his
LINE 1161: mind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
LINE 1162: fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
LINE 1163: for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.
LINE 1164: Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of
LINE 1165: white.
LINE 1166: Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two
LINE 1167: shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just
LINE 1168: here too. Wait. Think over it.
LINE 1169: With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
LINE 1170: his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt
LINE 1171: the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.
LINE 1172: The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick
LINE 1173: street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling
LINE 1174: my braces.
LINE 1175: Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat
LINE 1176: and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of
LINE 1177: his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to
LINE 1178: see.
LINE 1179: He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
LINE 1180: Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would
LINE 1181: he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being
LINE 1182: born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned
LINE 1183: and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration
LINE 1184: for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.
LINE 1185: Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to
LINE 1186: them someway.
LINE 1187: Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy.
LINE 1188: After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a
LINE 1189: magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat
LINE 1190: school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose
LINE 1191: at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a
LINE 1192: dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court.
LINE 1193: Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their
LINE 1194: percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil
LINE 1195: on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he's really
LINE 1196: what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers
LINE 1197: in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your
LINE 1198: soul.
LINE 1199: Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.
LINE 1200: Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. _The
LINE 1201: Messiah_ was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out
LINE 1202: there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a
LINE 1203: leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.
LINE 1204: Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.
LINE 1205: Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.
LINE 1206: His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved
LINE 1207: to the right.
LINE 1208: Is it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too
LINE 1209: heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.
LINE 1210: Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.
LINE 1211: Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?
LINE 1212: Didn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.
LINE 1213: The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold
LINE 1214: statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.
LINE 1215: No. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.
LINE 1216: My heart!
LINE 1217: His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir
LINE 1218: Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.
LINE 1219: Look for something I.
LINE 1220: His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded
LINE 1221: Agendath Netaim. Where did I?
LINE 1222: Busy looking.
LINE 1223: He thrust back quick Agendath.
LINE 1224: Afternoon she said.
LINE 1225: I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. _Freeman._
LINE 1226: Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?
LINE 1227: Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.
LINE 1228: His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap
LINE 1229: lotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.
LINE 1230: Safe!
