LINE 1: Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his
LINE 2: breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when
LINE 3: he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his
LINE 4: highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan
LINE 5: that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing
LINE 6: all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was
LINE 7: actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all
LINE 8: her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and
LINE 9: earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God
LINE 10: help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and
LINE 11: lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was
LINE 12: pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like
LINE 13: her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a
LINE 14: welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here
LINE 15: and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her
LINE 16: dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats
LINE 17: especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that
LINE 18: and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always
LINE 19: if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much
LINE 20: better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I
LINE 21: suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have
LINE 22: a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till
LINE 23: they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as
LINE 24: much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre
LINE 25: sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was
LINE 26: O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he
LINE 27: sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day
LINE 28: I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones

LINE 30: a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying
LINE 31: on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more
LINE 32: like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same
LINE 33: besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor
LINE 34: paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I
LINE 35: was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it
LINE 36: not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by
LINE 37: his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her
LINE 38: so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was
LINE 39: really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it
LINE 40: planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember
LINE 41: Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he
LINE 42: not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and
LINE 43: turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what
LINE 44: harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to
LINE 45: him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever
LINE 46: met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle
LINE 47: in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in
LINE 48: with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as

LINE 50: letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the
LINE 51: paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the
LINE 52: blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably
LINE 53: that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all
LINE 54: men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is
LINE 55: now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old
LINE 56: fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I
LINE 57: care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though
LINE 58: Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my
LINE 59: nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace
LINE 60: padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell
LINE 61: of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by
LINE 62: getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat
LINE 63: without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was
LINE 64: drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of
LINE 65: course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table
LINE 66: on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing
LINE 67: my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if
LINE 68: you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on
LINE 69: with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you
LINE 70: have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters
LINE 71: but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be
LINE 72: alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I
LINE 73: found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a
LINE 74: little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave
LINE 75: her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do
LINE 76: out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out
LINE 77: the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I
LINE 78: couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar
LINE 79: and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the
LINE 80: place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because
LINE 81: he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere
LINE 82: and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan
LINE 83: gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there
LINE 84: steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb
LINE 85: to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he
LINE 86: has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out
LINE 87: and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the
LINE 88: satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be
LINE 89: always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking
LINE 90: boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id
LINE 91: confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my
LINE 92: garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I
LINE 93: know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging
LINE 94: drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this
LINE 95: that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would
LINE 96: because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in
LINE 97: the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a
LINE 98: stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and
LINE 99: he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he
LINE 100: is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it
LINE 101: tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine
LINE 102: Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what
LINE 103: he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply
LINE 104: ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it
LINE 105: till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your
LINE 106: lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the
LINE 107: world about it people make its only the first time after that its just
LINE 108: the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man
LINE 109: without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when
LINE 110: you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish
LINE 111: some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in
LINE 112: his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul
LINE 113: almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to
LINE 114: Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and
LINE 115: I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my
LINE 116: child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where
LINE 117: you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done
LINE 118: with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put
LINE 119: it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he
LINE 120: want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat
LINE 121: hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he
LINE 122: Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in
LINE 123: the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never
LINE 124: turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost
LINE 125: for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them
LINE 126: Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense
LINE 127: off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre
LINE 128: married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the
LINE 129: pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt
LINE 130: like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though
LINE 131: I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of
LINE 132: his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it
LINE 133: who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of
LINE 134: drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they
LINE 135: stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking
LINE 136: green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with
LINE 137: the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American
LINE 138: that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do
LINE 139: to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took
LINE 140: the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt
LINE 141: lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I
LINE 142: popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful
LINE 143: to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when
LINE 144: I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in
LINE 145: Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and
LINE 146: tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing
LINE 147: about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that
LINE 148: evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it
LINE 149: brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to
LINE 150: church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only
LINE 151: grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I
LINE 152: lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that
LINE 153: tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or
LINE 154: whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is
LINE 155: not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my
LINE 156: hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a
LINE 157: thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think
LINE 158: a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life
LINE 159: felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must
LINE 160: have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with
LINE 161: a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into
LINE 162: you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious
LINE 163: look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a
LINE 164: tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on
LINE 165: me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt
LINE 166: washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice
LINE 167: invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if
LINE 168: someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went
LINE 169: through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina
LINE 170: Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up
LINE 171: with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a
LINE 172: smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like
LINE 173: a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the
LINE 174: last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and
LINE 175: bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied
LINE 176: till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what
LINE 177: supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was
LINE 178: married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has
LINE 179: more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting
LINE 180: Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him
LINE 181: off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I
LINE 182: know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing
LINE 183: and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming
LINE 184: and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not
LINE 185: liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over
LINE 186: politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a
LINE 187: carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive
LINE 188: about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for
LINE 189: I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he
LINE 190: annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot
LINE 191: of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often
LINE 192: wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family
LINE 193: physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was
LINE 194: crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with
LINE 195: her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever
LINE 196: he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me
LINE 197: the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that
LINE 198: finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I
LINE 199: know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out
LINE 200: to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know
LINE 201: plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch
LINE 202: him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them
LINE 203: all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of
LINE 204: course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him
LINE 205: that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love
LINE 206: him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might
LINE 207: imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of
LINE 208: a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it
LINE 209: out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and
LINE 210: wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the
LINE 211: night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I
LINE 212: want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper
LINE 213: with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too
LINE 214: much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know
LINE 215: more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie
LINE 216: whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I
LINE 217: said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash
LINE 218: possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick
LINE 219: when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the
LINE 220: indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what
LINE 221: spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at
LINE 222: that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was
LINE 223: too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged
LINE 224: afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of
LINE 225: laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling
LINE 226: out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great
LINE 227: humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it
LINE 228: meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us
LINE 229: not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault
LINE 230: she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes
LINE 231: got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her
LINE 232: face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she
LINE 233: must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment
LINE 234: she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk
LINE 235: about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes
LINE 236: he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him
LINE 237: just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might
LINE 238: murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes
LINE 239: mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when
LINE 240: he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he
LINE 241: always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and
LINE 242: now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard
LINE 243: U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff
LINE 244: to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what
LINE 245: could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than
LINE 246: marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like
LINE 247: me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and
LINE 248: he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick
LINE 249: that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man
LINE 250: yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and
LINE 251: do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating
LINE 252: drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask
LINE 253: us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because
LINE 254: they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off
LINE 255: flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say
LINE 256: its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have
LINE 257: been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being
LINE 258: hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do
LINE 259: besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they
LINE 260: theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he
LINE 261: noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C
LINE 262: with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both
LINE 263: ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his
LINE 264: two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it
LINE 265: was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed
LINE 266: breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting
LINE 267: all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long
LINE 268: one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got

LINE 272: turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea
LINE 273: 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him
LINE 274: because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he
LINE 275: meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that
LINE 276: if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill
LINE 277: stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still
LINE 278: I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of
LINE 279: a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to
LINE 280: mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my
LINE 281: stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another
LINE 282: time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I
LINE 283: could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world
LINE 284: that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and
LINE 285: beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because
LINE 286: the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in
LINE 287: the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere
LINE 288: I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell

LINE 295: place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him
LINE 296: about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there
LINE 297: and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it
LINE 298: or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an
LINE 299: idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got
LINE 300: me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me
LINE 301: to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming
LINE 302: along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had
LINE 303: to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape
LINE 304: of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me
LINE 305: when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject
LINE 306: of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced
LINE 307: things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels
LINE 308: even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one
LINE 309: in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see
LINE 310: every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain
LINE 311: I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the
LINE 312: Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the
LINE 313: Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking
LINE 314: slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they

LINE 321: said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an
LINE 322: excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time
LINE 323: till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his
LINE 324: waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in
LINE 325: the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them
LINE 326: and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the
LINE 327: sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet
LINE 328: if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you
LINE 329: never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it

LINE 332: from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he
LINE 333: circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do

LINE 335: all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the
LINE 336: butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me
LINE 337: that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to
LINE 338: any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we
LINE 339: met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw

LINE 345: Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children
LINE 346: seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice
LINE 347: a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman
LINE 348: when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote
LINE 349: the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it
LINE 350: simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to
LINE 351: embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the

LINE 1121: few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it
LINE 1122: really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love
