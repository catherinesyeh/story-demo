LINE 1: By lorries along sir John Rogerson's quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
LINE 2: Windmill lane, Leask's the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph
LINE 3: office. Could have given that address too. And past the sailors' home.
LINE 4: He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through
LINE 5: Lime street. By Brady's cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket
LINE 6: of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of
LINE 7: eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered
LINE 8: caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won't grow. O let him! His life
LINE 9: isn't such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come
LINE 10: home to ma, da. Slack hour: won't be many there. He crossed Townsend
LINE 11: street, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph,
LINE 12: Beth. And past Nichols' the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough.
LINE 13: Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O'Neill's. Singing with his
LINE 14: eyes shut. Corny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark.
LINE 15: Police tout. Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom
LINE 16: tooraloom tay. O, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a
LINE 17: whatyoumaycall. With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.
LINE 18: In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
LINE 19: Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
LINE 20: finest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom
LINE 21: Kernan. Couldn't ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still
LINE 22: read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent
LINE 23: his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm
LINE 24: morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the
LINE 25: leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand
LINE 26: came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card
LINE 27: behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
LINE 28: So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
LINE 29: hair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
LINE 30: blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it
LINE 31: must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
LINE 32: cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like
LINE 33: that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_,
LINE 34: not doing a hand's turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too
LINE 35: hot to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of
LINE 36: idleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens.
LINE 37: Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness
LINE 38: in the air. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and
LINE 39: cowheel. Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in
LINE 40: the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.
LINE 41: Couldn't sink if you tried: so thick with salt. Because the weight of
LINE 42: the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the
LINE 43: weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to the weight? It's a
LINE 44: law something like that. Vance in High school cracking his
LINE 45: fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum.
LINE 46: What is weight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per
LINE 47: second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They
LINE 48: all fall to the ground. The earth. It's the force of gravity of the
LINE 49: earth is the weight.
LINE 50: He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
LINE 51: sausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded
LINE 52: _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a
LINE 53: baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.
LINE 54: Careless air: just drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second
LINE 55: for every second it means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance
LINE 56: through the door of the postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one.
LINE 57: In.
LINE 58: He handed the card through the brass grill.
LINE 59: —Are there any letters for me? he asked.
LINE 60: While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
LINE 61: poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
LINE 62: baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer
LINE 63: probably. Went too far last time.
LINE 64: The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
LINE 65: letter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.
LINE 66: Henry Flower Esq,
LINE 67: c/o P. O. Westland Row,
LINE 68: City.
LINE 69: Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
LINE 70: reviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where's old Tweedy's regiment?
LINE 71: Castoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he's a
LINE 72: grenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.
LINE 73: Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform.
LINE 74: Easier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne's letter about taking them off
LINE 75: O'Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith's
LINE 76: paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease:
LINE 77: overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like.
LINE 78: Eyes front. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King's own. Never see
LINE 79: him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.
LINE 80: He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if
LINE 81: that would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
LINE 82: felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
LINE 83: Women will pay a lot of heed, I don't think. His fingers drew forth the
LINE 84: letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something
LINE 85: pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.
LINE 86: M'Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when
LINE 87: you.
LINE 88: —Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
LINE 89: —Hello, M'Coy. Nowhere in particular.
LINE 90: —How's the body?
LINE 91: —Fine. How are you?
LINE 92: —Just keeping alive, M'Coy said.
LINE 93: His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
LINE 94: —Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you're...
LINE 95: —O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
LINE 96: —To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
LINE 97: A photo it isn't. A badge maybe.
LINE 98: —E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
LINE 99: —I must try to get out there, M'Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard
LINE 100: it last night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?
LINE 101: —I know.
LINE 102: Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
LINE 103: of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She
LINE 104: stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
LINE 105: searched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll
LINE 106: collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless
LINE 107: stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty
LINE 108: creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the
LINE 109: spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The
LINE 110: honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take
LINE 111: the starch out of her.
LINE 112: —I was with Bob Doran, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do
LINE 113: you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway's we were.
LINE 114: Doran Lyons in Conway's. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came
LINE 115: Hoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
LINE 116: his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
LINE 117: braided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight
LINE 118: perhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will
LINE 119: she get up?
LINE 120: —And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I
LINE 121: said. _Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.
LINE 122: Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces
LINE 123: dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?
LINE 124: Sees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two
LINE 125: strings to her bow.
LINE 126: —_Why?_ I said. _What's wrong with him?_ I said.
LINE 127: Proud: rich: silk stockings.
LINE 128: —Yes, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 129: He moved a little to the side of M'Coy's talking head. Getting up in a
LINE 130: minute.
LINE 131: —_What's wrong with him_? He said. _He's dead_, he said. And, faith, he
LINE 132: filled up. _Is it Paddy Dignam_? I said. I couldn't believe it when I
LINE 133: heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it
LINE 134: in the Arch. _Yes,_ he said. _He's gone. He died on Monday, poor
LINE 135: fellow_.
LINE 136: Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!
LINE 137: A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.
LINE 138: Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and
LINE 139: the peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace
LINE 140: street hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering
LINE 141: the display of. _Esprit de corps_. Well, what are you gaping at?
LINE 142: —Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
LINE 143: —One of the best, M'Coy said.
LINE 144: The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
LINE 145: gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
LINE 146: hat in the sun: flicker, flick.
LINE 147: —Wife well, I suppose? M'Coy's changed voice said.
LINE 148: —O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
LINE 149: He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
LINE 150: What is home without
LINE 151: Plumtree's Potted Meat?
LINE 152: Incomplete.
LINE 153: With it an abode of bliss.
LINE 154: —My missus has just got an engagement. At least it's not settled yet.
LINE 155: Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I'm off that, thanks.
LINE 156: Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.
LINE 157: —My wife too, he said. She's going to sing at a swagger affair in the
LINE 158: Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.
LINE 159: —That so? M'Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who's getting it up?
LINE 160: Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread
LINE 161: and. No book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.
LINE 162: Dark lady and fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of
LINE 163: envelope.
LINE 164: Love's
LINE 165: Old
LINE 166: Sweet
LINE 167: Song
LINE 168: Comes lo-ove's old...
LINE 169: —It's a kind of a tour, don't you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
LINE 170: _Sweeeet song_. There's a committee formed. Part shares and part
LINE 171: profits.
LINE 172: M'Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.
LINE 173: —O, well, he said. That's good news.
LINE 174: He moved to go.
LINE 175: —Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.
LINE 176: —Yes, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 177: —Tell you what, M'Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,
LINE 178: will you? I'd like to go but I mightn't be able, you see. There's a
LINE 179: drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
LINE 180: would have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name
LINE 181: if I'm not there, will you?
LINE 182: —I'll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That'll be all right.
LINE 183: —Right, M'Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I'd go if I possibly
LINE 184: could. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M'Coy will do.
LINE 185: —That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
LINE 186: Didn't catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I'd
LINE 187: like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped
LINE 188: corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him
LINE 189: his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings
LINE 190: of it from that good day to this.
LINE 191: Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has
LINE 192: just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in
LINE 193: its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don't you
LINE 194: know: in the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would.
LINE 195: Can't he hear the difference? Think he's that way inclined a bit.
LINE 196: Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope
LINE 197: that smallpox up there doesn't get worse. Suppose she wouldn't let
LINE 198: herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.
LINE 199: Wonder is he pimping after me?
LINE 200: Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
LINE 201: hoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane's Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery's
LINE 202: Summer Sale. No, he's going on straight. Hello. _Leah_ tonight. Mrs
LINE 203: Bandmann Palmer. Like to see her again in that. _Hamlet_ she played
LINE 204: last night. Male impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia
LINE 205: committed suicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in
LINE 206: that. Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.
LINE 207: Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What
LINE 208: is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The
LINE 209: scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham
LINE 210: recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.
LINE 211: Nathan's voice! His son's voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left
LINE 212: his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of
LINE 213: his father and left the God of his father.
LINE 214: Every word is so deep, Leopold.
LINE 215: Poor papa! Poor man! I'm glad I didn't go into the room to look at his
LINE 216: face. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for
LINE 217: him.
LINE 218: Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
LINE 219: hazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn't met
LINE 220: that M'Coy fellow.
LINE 221: He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently
LINE 222: champing teeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid
LINE 223: the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn
LINE 224: all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in
LINE 225: nosebags. Too full for words. Still they get their feed all right and
LINE 226: their doss. Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp
LINE 227: between their haunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor
LINE 228: brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.
LINE 229: He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
LINE 230: carried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
LINE 231: He passed the cabman's shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
LINE 232: All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.
LINE 233: _Voglio e non_. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a
LINE 234: few flying syllables as they pass. He hummed:
LINE 235: Là ci darem la mano
LINE 236: La la lala la la.
LINE 237: He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in
LINE 238: the lee of the station wall. No-one. Meade's timberyard. Piled balks.
LINE 239: Ruins and tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch
LINE 240: court with its forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard
LINE 241: a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.
LINE 242: A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to
LINE 243: disturb them. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.
LINE 244: Open it. And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame's
LINE 245: school. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis's. And Mr? He opened the letter
LINE 246: within the newspaper.
LINE 247: A flower. I think it's a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not
LINE 248: annoyed then? What does she say?
LINE 249: Dear Henry
LINE 250: I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry
LINE 251: you did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am
LINE 252: awfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called
LINE 253: you naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me
LINE 254: what is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home
LINE 255: you poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.
LINE 256: Please tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the
LINE 257: beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you
LINE 258: so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a
LINE 259: man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell
LINE 260: me more. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what
LINE 261: I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to
LINE 262: meet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
LINE 263: exhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I
LINE 264: have such a bad headache. today. and write _by return_ to your longing
LINE 265: Martha
LINE 266: P. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to
LINE 267: know.
LINE 268: He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
LINE 269: and placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it
LINE 270: because no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then
LINE 271: walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
LINE 272: there a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your
LINE 273: cactus if you don't please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear
LINE 274: roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha's
LINE 275: perfume. Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it
LINE 276: back in his sidepocket.
LINE 277: Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did
LINE 278: she wrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like
LINE 279: me, respectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.
LINE 280: Thank you: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round
LINE 281: corners. Bad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic.
LINE 282: Go further next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.
LINE 283: Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
LINE 284: Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.
LINE 285: Common pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:
LINE 286: pinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses
LINE 287: without thorns.
LINE 288: Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in
LINE 289: the Coombe, linked together in the rain.
LINE 290: O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.
LINE 291: She didn't know what to do
LINE 292: To keep it up,
LINE 293: To keep it up.
LINE 294: It? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all
LINE 295: day typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your
LINE 296: wife use. Now could you make out a thing like that?
LINE 297: To keep it up.
LINE 298: Martha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or
LINE 299: faked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious.
LINE 300: Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.
LINE 301: To keep it up.
LINE 302: Nice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:
LINE 303: quiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have
LINE 304: been, strange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the
LINE 305: supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like
LINE 306: the hole in the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I
LINE 307: go to the trottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell
LINE 308: her: more and more: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.
LINE 309: Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly
LINE 310: in shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered
LINE 311: away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.
LINE 312: Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the
LINE 313: same way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure
LINE 314: cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be
LINE 315: made out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change
LINE 316: his shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A
LINE 317: million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,
LINE 318: eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of
LINE 319: porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen
LINE 320: millions of barrels of porter.
LINE 321: What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the
LINE 322: same.
LINE 323: An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.
LINE 324: Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The
LINE 325: bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
LINE 326: together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
LINE 327: pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.
LINE 328: He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the
LINE 329: porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it
LINE 330: again behind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work
LINE 331: M'Coy for a pass to Mullingar.
LINE 332: Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J.
LINE 333: on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the
LINE 334: conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.
LINE 335: The protestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the
LINE 336: true religion. Save China's millions. Wonder how they explain it to the
LINE 337: heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for
LINE 338: them. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy
LINE 339: with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo.
LINE 340: Crown of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.
LINE 341: Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.
LINE 342: Sorry I didn't work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of
LINE 343: that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn't. They're taught that.
LINE 344: He's not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to
LINE 345: baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.
LINE 346: Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,
LINE 347: listening. Still life. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.
LINE 348: The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,
LINE 349: pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.
LINE 350: Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place
LINE 351: to be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow
LINE 352: music. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the
LINE 353: benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch
LINE 354: knelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,
LINE 355: holding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a
LINE 356: communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it
LINE 357: neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her
LINE 358: hat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent
LINE 359: down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next
LINE 360: one. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? _Corpus:_ body. Corpse.
LINE 361: Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They
LINE 362: don't seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a
LINE 363: corpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.
LINE 364: He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
LINE 365: one, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in
LINE 366: its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.
LINE 367: We ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here
LINE 368: and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
LINE 369: it to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it's that
LINE 370: sort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes
LINE 371: them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it's called.
LINE 372: There's a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you
LINE 373: feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one
LINE 374: family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I'm
LINE 375: sure of that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit
LINE 376: spreeish. Let off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes
LINE 377: cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.
LINE 378: Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind
LINE 379: faith. Safe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time
LINE 380: next year.
LINE 381: He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
LINE 382: instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
LINE 383: affair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn't know what
LINE 384: to do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.
LINE 385: Molly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have
LINE 386: suffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.
LINE 387: Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with
LINE 388: a veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here
LINE 389: with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the
LINE 390: sly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen's evidence on the
LINE 391: invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
LINE 392: every morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I
LINE 393: am thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six
LINE 394: children at home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those
LINE 395: crawthumpers, now that's a good name for them, there's always something
LINE 396: shiftylooking about them. They're not straight men of business either.
LINE 397: O, no, she's not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up
LINE 398: that envelope? Yes: under the bridge.
LINE 399: The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
LINE 400: smartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
LINE 401: what they are used to Guinness's porter or some temperance beverage
LINE 402: Wheatley's Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane's ginger ale
LINE 403: (aromatic). Doesn't give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.
LINE 404: Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they'd have one
LINE 405: old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer
LINE 406: the whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.
LINE 407: Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music.
LINE 408: Pity. Who has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make
LINE 409: that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he
LINE 410: had in Gardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat
LINE 411: Mater_ of Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan's sermon first. Christ or
LINE 412: Pilate? Christ, but don't keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.
LINE 413: Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice
LINE 414: against that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
LINE 415: people looking up:
LINE 416: _Quis est homo._
LINE 417: Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
LINE 418: Mozart's twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that. Those old popes keen on music,
LINE 419: on art and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example
LINE 420: too. They had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting,
LINE 421: regular hours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse.
LINE 422: Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.
LINE 423: What kind of voice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own
LINE 424: strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn't feel anything after.
LINE 425: Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don't they? Gluttons,
LINE 426: tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.
LINE 427: He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
LINE 428: bless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom
LINE 429: glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand
LINE 430: up at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again
LINE 431: and he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the
LINE 432: altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered
LINE 433: each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a
LINE 434: card:
LINE 435: —O God, our refuge and our strength...
LINE 436: Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them
LINE 437: the bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious
LINE 438: and immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More
LINE 439: interesting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful
LINE 440: organisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants
LINE 441: to. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon
LINE 442: in their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I
LINE 443: schschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look
LINE 444: down at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.
LINE 445: Husband learn to his surprise. God's little joke. Then out she comes.
LINE 446: Repentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy
LINE 447: Mary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation
LINE 448: army blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.
LINE 449: How I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they
LINE 450: work the whole show. And don't they rake in the money too? Bequests
LINE 451: also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion. Masses
LINE 452: for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.
LINE 453: Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the
LINE 454: witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.
LINE 455: Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of
LINE 456: the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.
LINE 457: The priest prayed:
LINE 458: —Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be our
LINE 459: safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God
LINE 460: restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly
LINE 461: host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those
LINE 462: other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of
LINE 463: souls.
LINE 464: The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women
LINE 465: remained behind: thanksgiving.
LINE 466: Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate
LINE 467: perhaps. Pay your Easter duty.
LINE 468: He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
LINE 469: time? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there's a
LINE 470: (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.
LINE 471: Glimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don't. Why didn't you tell me
LINE 472: before. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn't farther south.
LINE 473: He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the
LINE 474: main door into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black
LINE 475: marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive
LINE 476: hands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott's
LINE 477: dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice because I'm in mourning myself.
LINE 478: He covered himself. How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet.
LINE 479: Better get that lotion made up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time.
LINE 480: Sweny's in Lincoln place. Chemists rarely move. Their green and gold
LINE 481: beaconjars too heavy to stir. Hamilton Long's, founded in the year of
LINE 482: the flood. Huguenot churchyard near there. Visit some day.
LINE 483: He walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other
LINE 484: trousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.
LINE 485: O well, poor fellow, it's not his fault. When was it I got it made up
LINE 486: last? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it
LINE 487: must have been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions
LINE 488: book.
LINE 489: The chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he
LINE 490: seems to have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher's
LINE 491: stone. The alchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy
LINE 492: then. Why? Reaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your
LINE 493: character. Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.
LINE 494: All his alabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te
LINE 495: Virid. Smell almost cure you like the dentist's doorbell. Doctor Whack.
LINE 496: He ought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first
LINE 497: fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples.
LINE 498: Want to be careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns
LINE 499: blue litmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping
LINE 500: draughts. Lovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the
LINE 501: pores or the phlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least
LINE 502: expect it. Clever of nature.
LINE 503: —About a fortnight ago, sir?
LINE 504: —Yes, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 505: He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
LINE 506: dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling
LINE 507: your aches and pains.
LINE 508: —Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
LINE 509: orangeflower water...
LINE 510: It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.
LINE 511: —And white wax also, he said.
LINE 512: Brings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to her
LINE 513: eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
LINE 514: cuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
LINE 515: teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.
LINE 516: Skinfood. One of the old queen's sons, duke of Albany was it? had only
LINE 517: one skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to
LINE 518: make it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your?
LINE 519: _Peau d'Espagne_. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these
LINE 520: soaps have. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner.
LINE 521: Hammam. Turkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a
LINE 522: nice girl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious
LINE 523: longing I. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time
LINE 524: for massage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
LINE 525: —Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a
LINE 526: bottle?
LINE 527: —No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I'll call later in the day and
LINE 528: I'll take one of these soaps. How much are they?
LINE 529: —Fourpence, sir.
LINE 530: Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.
LINE 531: —I'll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.
LINE 532: —Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
LINE 533: come back.
LINE 534: —Good, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 535: He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
LINE 536: coolwrappered soap in his left hand.
LINE 537: At his armpit Bantam Lyons' voice and hand said:
LINE 538: —Hello, Bloom. What's the best news? Is that today's? Show us a minute.
LINE 539: Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
LINE 540: younger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
LINE 541: Bantam Lyons's yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a
LINE 542: wash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears'
LINE 543: soap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
LINE 544: —I want to see about that French horse that's running today, Bantam
LINE 545: Lyons said. Where the bugger is it?
LINE 546: He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
LINE 547: Barber's itch. Tight collar he'll lose his hair. Better leave him the
LINE 548: paper and get shut of him.
LINE 549: —You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 550: —Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the
LINE 551: second.
LINE 552: —I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 553: Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.
LINE 554: —What's that? his sharp voice said.
LINE 555: —I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away
LINE 556: that moment.
LINE 557: Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
LINE 558: sheets back on Mr Bloom's arms.
LINE 559: —I'll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.
LINE 560: He sped off towards Conway's corner. God speed scut.
LINE 561: Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
LINE 562: in it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it
LINE 563: lately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large
LINE 564: tender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming
LINE 565: embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now.
LINE 566: They never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.
LINE 567: He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
LINE 568: mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He
LINE 569: eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist
LINE 570: doubled up like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it
LINE 571: round like a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the
LINE 572: hub big: college. Something to catch the eye.
LINE 573: There's Hornblower standing at the porter's lodge. Keep him on hands:
LINE 574: might take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower?
LINE 575: How do you do, sir?
LINE 576: Heavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.
LINE 577: Sit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can't play it
LINE 578: here. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the
LINE 579: Kildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more in
LINE 580: their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M'Carthy took the
LINE 581: floor. Heatwave. Won't last. Always passing, the stream of life, which
LINE 582: in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.
LINE 583: Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
LINE 584: stream. This is my body.
LINE 585: He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
LINE 586: warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his trunk
LINE 587: and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
LINE 588: lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
LINE 589: his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father
LINE 590: of thousands, a languid floating flower.
