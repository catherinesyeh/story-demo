LINE 1: Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought
LINE 2: through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn
LINE 3: and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,
LINE 4: rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.
LINE 5: Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By
LINE 6: knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a
LINE 7: millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_. Limit of the diaphane in.
LINE 8: Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through
LINE 9: it it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.
LINE 10: Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and
LINE 11: shells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a
LINE 12: time. A very short space of time through very short times of space.
LINE 13: Five, six: the _nacheinander_. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable
LINE 14: modality of the audible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a
LINE 15: cliff that beetles o'er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_
LINE 16: ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at
LINE 17: my side. Tap with it: they do. My two feet in his boots are at the ends
LINE 18: of his legs, _nebeneinander_. Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los
LINE 19: Demiurgos_. Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand? Crush,
LINE 20: crack, crick, crick. Wild sea money. Dominie Deasy kens them a'.
LINE 21: Won't you come to Sandymount,
LINE 22: Madeline the mare?
LINE 23: Rhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs
LINE 24: marching. No, agallop: _deline the mare_.
LINE 25: Open your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I
LINE 26: open and am for ever in the black adiaphane. _Basta!_ I will see if I
LINE 27: can see.
LINE 28: See now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world
LINE 29: without end.
LINE 30: They came down the steps from Leahy's terrace prudently,
LINE 31: _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed
LINE 32: feet sinking in the silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our
LINE 33: mighty mother. Number one swung lourdily her midwife's bag, the other's
LINE 34: gamp poked in the beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs
LINE 35: Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of
LINE 36: Bride Street. One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.
LINE 37: Creation from nothing. What has she in the bag? A misbirth with a
LINE 38: trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool. The cords of all link back,
LINE 39: strandentwining cable of all flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you
LINE 40: be as gods? Gaze in your _omphalos_. Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to
LINE 41: Edenville. Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.
LINE 42: Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.
LINE 43: Gaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no,
LINE 44: whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to
LINE 45: everlasting. Womb of sin.
LINE 46: Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man
LINE 47: with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.
LINE 48: They clasped and sundered, did the coupler's will. From before the ages
LINE 49: He willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A _lex eterna_ stays
LINE 50: about Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are
LINE 51: consubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring
LINE 52: his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred
LINE 53: heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.
LINE 54: With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of
LINE 55: a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.
LINE 56: Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.
LINE 57: The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of
LINE 58: Mananaan.
LINE 59: I mustn't forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half
LINE 60: twelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.
LINE 61: Yes, I must.
LINE 62: His pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara's or not? My
LINE 63: consubstantial father's voice. Did you see anything of your artist
LINE 64: brother Stephen lately? No? Sure he's not down in Strasburg terrace
LINE 65: with his aunt Sally? Couldn't he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And
LINE 66: and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the
LINE 67: things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little
LINE 68: costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable
LINE 69: gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes,
LINE 70: sir. No, sir. Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!
LINE 71: I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take
LINE 72: me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.
LINE 73: —It's Stephen, sir.
LINE 74: —Let him in. Let Stephen in.
LINE 75: A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.
LINE 76: —We thought you were someone else.
LINE 77: In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over
LINE 78: the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed
LINE 79: the upper moiety.
LINE 80: —Morrow, nephew.
LINE 81: He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the
LINE 82: eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and
LINE 83: common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_. A bogoak frame over his
LINE 84: bald head: Wilde's _Requiescat_. The drone of his misleading whistle
LINE 85: brings Walter back.
LINE 86: —Yes, sir?
LINE 87: —Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?
LINE 88: —Bathing Crissie, sir.
LINE 89: Papa's little bedpal. Lump of love.
LINE 90: —No, uncle Richie...
LINE 91: —Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!
LINE 92: —Uncle Richie, really...
LINE 93: —Sit down or by the law Harry I'll knock you down.
LINE 94: Walter squints vainly for a chair.
LINE 95: —He has nothing to sit down on, sir.
LINE 96: —He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.
LINE 97: Would you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs
LINE 98: here. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the
LINE 99: better. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.
LINE 100: _All'erta!_
LINE 101: He drones bars of Ferrando's _aria di sortita_. The grandest number,
LINE 102: Stephen, in the whole opera. Listen.
LINE 103: His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the
LINE 104: air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.
LINE 105: This wind is sweeter.
LINE 106: Houses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you
LINE 107: had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of
LINE 108: them, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh's
LINE 109: library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For
LINE 110: whom? The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his
LINE 111: kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the
LINE 112: moon, his eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine
LINE 113: faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas father,
LINE 114: furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff! _Descende,
LINE 115: calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_. A garland of grey hair on his
LINE 116: comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace
LINE 117: (_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down,
LINE 118: baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the
LINE 119: altar's horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their
LINE 120: albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of
LINE 121: wheat.
LINE 122: And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating
LINE 123: it. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.
LINE 124: Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own
LINE 125: cheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,
LINE 126: invincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled
LINE 127: his brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his
LINE 128: second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,
LINE 129: rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang
LINE 130: in diphthong.
LINE 131: Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were
LINE 132: awfully holy, weren't you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you
LINE 133: might not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue
LINE 134: that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from
LINE 135: the wet street. _O si, certo!_ Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags
LINE 136: pinned round a squaw. More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth
LINE 137: tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about
LINE 138: that, eh?
LINE 139: What about what? What else were they invented for?
LINE 140: Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.
LINE 141: You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause
LINE 142: earnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one
LINE 143: saw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for
LINE 144: titles. Have you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is
LINE 145: wonderful. O yes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval
LINE 146: leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great
LINE 147: libraries of the world, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them
LINE 148: there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della
LINE 149: Mirandola like. Ay, very like a whale. When one reads these strange
LINE 150: pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who
LINE 151: once...
LINE 152: The grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again a
LINE 153: damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the
LINE 154: unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.
LINE 155: Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing
LINE 156: upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a
LINE 157: midden of man's ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle
LINE 158: stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel:
LINE 159: isle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze
LINE 160: of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the
LINE 161: higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams
LINE 162: of brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.
LINE 163: He halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara's. Am I not going there?
LINE 164: Seems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer
LINE 165: sand towards the Pigeonhouse.
LINE 166: _—Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_
LINE 167: _—C'est le pigeon, Joseph._
LINE 168: Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar
LINE 169: MacMahon. Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father's a
LINE 170: bird, he lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump
LINE 171: bunny's face. Lap, _lapin._ He hopes to win in the _gros lots_. About
LINE 172: the nature of women he read in Michelet. But he must send me _La Vie de
LINE 173: Jésus_ by M. Léo Taxil. Lent it to his friend.
LINE 174: _—C'est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas
LINE 175: en l'existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire à mon père._
LINE 176: _—Il croit?_
LINE 177: _—Mon père, oui._
LINE 178: _Schluss_. He laps.
LINE 179: My Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want
LINE 180: puce gloves. You were a student, weren't you? Of what in the other
LINE 181: devil's name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: _physiques, chimiques et
LINE 182: naturelles_. Aha. Eating your groatsworth of _mou en civet_, fleshpots
LINE 183: of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural
LINE 184: tone: when I was in Paris; _boul' Mich'_, I used to. Yes, used to carry
LINE 185: punched tickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder
LINE 186: somewhere. Justice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904
LINE 187: the prisoner was seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me.
LINE 188: Hat, tie, overcoat, nose. _Lui, c'est moi_. You seem to have enjoyed
LINE 189: yourself.
LINE 190: Proudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a
LINE 191: dispossessed. With mother's money order, eight shillings, the banging
LINE 192: door of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger
LINE 193: toothache. _Encore deux minutes_. Look clock. Must get. _Fermé_. Hired
LINE 194: dog! Shoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered
LINE 195: walls all brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not
LINE 196: hurt? O, that's all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O,
LINE 197: that's all right. Shake a shake. O, that's all only all right.
LINE 198: You were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery
LINE 199: Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt
LINE 200: from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge!_ Pretending to
LINE 201: speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence,
LINE 202: across the slimy pier at Newhaven. _Comment?_ Rich booty you brought
LINE 203: back; _Le Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte
LINE 204: Rouge_; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show:
LINE 205: —Mother dying come home father.
LINE 206: The aunt thinks you killed your mother. That's why she won't.
LINE 207: Then here's a health to Mulligan's aunt
LINE 208: And I'll tell you the reason why.
LINE 209: She always kept things decent in
LINE 210: The Hannigan famileye.
LINE 211: His feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by
LINE 212: the boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone
LINE 213: mammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is
LINE 214: there, the slender trees, the lemon houses.
LINE 215: Paris rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of
LINE 216: farls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court the
LINE 217: air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife's lover's wife, the
LINE 218: kerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In
LINE 219: Rodot's Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering
LINE 220: with gold teeth _chaussons_ of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the
LINE 221: _pus_ of _flan bréton_. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased
LINE 222: pleasers, curled conquistadores.
LINE 223: Noon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers
LINE 224: smeared with printer's ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his
LINE 225: white. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. _Un demi
LINE 226: sétier!_ A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves
LINE 227: me at his beck. _Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux
LINE 228: irlandais, nous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui!_ She thought you wanted a
LINE 229: cheese _hollandais_. Your postprandial, do you know that word?
LINE 230: Postprandial. There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer
LINE 231: fellow, used to call it his postprandial. Well: _slainte!_ Around the
LINE 232: slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His
LINE 233: breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy's fang
LINE 234: thrusting between his lips. Of Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes,
LINE 235: conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith now, A E, pimander, good shepherd of
LINE 236: men. To yoke me as his yokefellow, our crimes our common cause. You're
LINE 237: your father's son. I know the voice. His fustian shirt,
LINE 238: sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at his secrets. M.
LINE 239: Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called queen
LINE 240: Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. _Vieille ogresse_ with the
LINE 241: _dents jaunes_. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, _La Patrie_, M. Millevoye,
LINE 242: Félix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken, _bonne à
LINE 243: tout faire_, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. _Moi
LINE 244: faire_, she said, _Tous les messieurs_. Not this _Monsieur_, I said.
LINE 245: Most licentious custom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn't let my
LINE 246: brother, not even my own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I
LINE 247: see you. Fang, I feel. Lascivious people.
LINE 248: The blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose
LINE 249: tobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw
LINE 250: facebones under his peep of day boy's hat. How the head centre got
LINE 251: away, authentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil,
LINE 252: orangeblossoms, drove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost
LINE 253: leaders, the betrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not
LINE 254: here.
LINE 255: Spurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell
LINE 256: you. I'll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her
LINE 257: love he prowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under
LINE 258: the walls of Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl
LINE 259: them upward in the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay
LINE 260: Paree he hides, Egan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his
LINE 261: day's stations, the dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the
LINE 262: Montmartre lair he sleeps short night in, rue de la Goutte-d'Or,
LINE 263: damascened with flyblown faces of the gone. Loveless, landless,
LINE 264: wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without her outcast man, madame in
LINE 265: rue Gît-le-Cœur, canary and two buck lodgers. Peachy cheeks, a zebra
LINE 266: skirt, frisky as a young thing's. Spurned and undespairing. Tell Pat
LINE 267: you saw me, won't you? I wanted to get poor Pat a job one time. _Mon
LINE 268: fils_, soldier of France. I taught him to sing _The boys of Kilkenny
LINE 269: are stout roaring blades_. Know that old lay? I taught Patrice that.
LINE 270: Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow's castle on the Nore. Goes like
LINE 271: this. _O, O_. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.
LINE 272: O, O the boys of
LINE 273: Kilkenny...
LINE 274: Weak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.
LINE 275: Remembering thee, O Sion.
LINE 276: He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.
LINE 277: The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of
LINE 278: seeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,
LINE 279: am I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the
LINE 280: quaking soil. Turn back.
LINE 281: Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in
LINE 282: new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the
LINE 283: barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet
LINE 284: are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,
LINE 285: nightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,
LINE 286: their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned
LINE 287: platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when
LINE 288: this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind
LINE 289: bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted
LINE 290: his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take
LINE 291: all, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon's
LINE 292: midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing
LINE 293: Elsinore's tempting flood.
LINE 294: The flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back
LINE 295: then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge
LINE 296: and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a
LINE 297: grike.
LINE 298: A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the
LINE 299: gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. _Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot
LINE 300: called Gautier's prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind
LINE 301: have silted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren
LINE 302: of weasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and
LINE 303: stones. Heavy of the past. Sir Lout's toys. Mind you don't get one bang
LINE 304: on the ear. I'm the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well
LINE 305: boulders, bones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz
LINE 306: odz an Iridzman.
LINE 307: A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.
LINE 308: Lord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not be
LINE 309: master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From
LINE 310: farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,
LINE 311: two. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.
LINE 312: Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?
LINE 313: Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their
LINE 314: bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,
LINE 315: torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the
LINE 316: collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,
LINE 317: spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework
LINE 318: city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers' knives,
LINE 319: running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague
LINE 320: and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved
LINE 321: among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the
LINE 322: spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.
LINE 323: The dog's bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I
LINE 324: just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. _Terribilia meditans_. A
LINE 325: primrose doublet, fortune's knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you
LINE 326: pining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The
LINE 327: Bruce's brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,
LINE 328: York's false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a
LINE 329: day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion
LINE 330: crowned. All kings' sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved
LINE 331: men from drowning and you shake at a cur's yelping. But the courtiers
LINE 332: who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...
LINE 333: We don't want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what
LINE 334: he did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. _Natürlich_, put there for
LINE 335: you. Would you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago
LINE 336: off Maiden's rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it
LINE 337: out. I would want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water
LINE 338: cold soft. When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can't
LINE 339: see! Who's behind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing
LINE 340: quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly,
LINE 341: shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life still
LINE 342: to be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me
LINE 343: out of horror of his death. I... With him together down... I could not
LINE 344: save her. Waters: bitter death: lost.
LINE 345: A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.
LINE 346: Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on
LINE 347: all sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made
LINE 348: off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a
LINE 349: lowskimming gull. The man's shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He
LINE 350: turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a
LINE 351: field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of
LINE 352: the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout
LINE 353: lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented
LINE 354: towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth,
LINE 355: breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.
LINE 356: Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,
LINE 357: soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped
LINE 358: running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again
LINE 359: reared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them
LINE 360: as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf's tongue redpanting
LINE 361: from his jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped
LINE 362: off at a calf's gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped,
LINE 363: sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,
LINE 364: sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog's bedraggled fell.
LINE 365: Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah,
LINE 366: poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody's body.
LINE 367: —Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!
LINE 368: The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless
LINE 369: kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He
LINE 370: slunk back in a curve. Doesn't see me. Along by the edge of the mole he
LINE 371: lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed
LINE 372: against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed
LINE 373: quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His
LINE 374: hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.
LINE 375: Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,
LINE 376: dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand
LINE 377: again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in
LINE 378: spousebreach, vulturing the dead.
LINE 379: After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.
LINE 380: Street of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That
LINE 381: man led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against
LINE 382: my face. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come.
LINE 383: Red carpet spread. You will see who.
LINE 384: Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet
LINE 385: out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler
LINE 386: strangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the
LINE 387: ruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand
LINE 388: and shellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair
LINE 389: trailed. Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When
LINE 390: night hides her body's flaws calling under her brown shawl from an
LINE 391: archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal
LINE 392: Dublins in O'Loughlin's of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues' rum
LINE 393: lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend's whiteness under her
LINE 394: rancid rags. Fumbally's lane that night: the tanyard smells.
LINE 395: White thy fambles, red thy gan
LINE 396: And thy quarrons dainty is.
LINE 397: Couch a hogshead with me then.
LINE 398: In the darkmans clip and kiss.
LINE 399: Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.
LINE 400: Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: _thy quarrons
LINE 401: dainty is_. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads
LINE 402: jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their
LINE 403: pockets.
LINE 404: Passing now.
LINE 405: A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I
LINE 406: am not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun's
LINE 407: flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges,
LINE 408: schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering,
LINE 409: moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not
LINE 410: mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon.
LINE 411: In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed,
LINE 412: childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. He
LINE 413: comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying
LINE 414: the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.
LINE 415: Here. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.
LINE 416: No. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth's kiss.
LINE 417: His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.
LINE 418: Oomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:
LINE 419: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring
LINE 420: wayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy's
LINE 421: letter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.
LINE 422: Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and
LINE 423: scribbled words. That's twice I forgot to take slips from the library
LINE 424: counter.
LINE 425: His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till
LINE 426: the farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness
LINE 427: shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there
LINE 428: with his augur's rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid
LINE 429: sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth
LINE 430: stars. I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it
LINE 431: back. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here?
LINE 432: Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white
LINE 433: field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of
LINE 434: Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space
LINE 435: with coloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a
LINE 436: flat: yes, that's right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far,
LINE 437: flat I see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in
LINE 438: stereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is
LINE 439: in our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our
LINE 440: sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the
LINE 441: more.
LINE 442: She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue
LINE 443: hell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality
LINE 444: of the ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at
LINE 445: Hodges Figgis' window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet
LINE 446: books you were going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through
LINE 447: the braided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a
LINE 448: grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else,
LINE 449: Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders
LINE 450: and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple
LINE 451: dumplings, _piuttosto_. Where are your wits?
LINE 452: Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me
LINE 453: soon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.
LINE 454: Sad too. Touch, touch me.
LINE 455: He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the
LINE 456: scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his
LINE 457: eyes. That is Kevin Egan's movement I made, nodding for his nap,
LINE 458: sabbath sleep. _Et vidit Deus. Et erant valde bona_. Alo! _Bonjour_.
LINE 459: Welcome as the flowers in May. Under its leaf he watched through
LINE 460: peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caught in this burning
LINE 461: scene. Pan's hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavy serpentplants,
LINE 462: milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is
LINE 463: far.
LINE 464: And no more turn aside and brood.
LINE 465: His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck's castoffs,
LINE 466: _nebeneinander_. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein
LINE 467: another's foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in
LINE 468: tripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt's
LINE 469: shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. _Tiens, quel petit pied!_
LINE 470: Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde's love that dare not speak its
LINE 471: name. His arm: Cranly's arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I
LINE 472: am. As I am. All or not at all.
LINE 473: In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering
LINE 474: greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float
LINE 475: away. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the
LINE 476: low rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a
LINE 477: fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of
LINE 478: waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it
LINE 479: slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech
LINE 480: ceases. It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower
LINE 481: unfurling.
LINE 482: Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and
LINE 483: sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water
LINE 484: swaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:
LINE 485: lifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,
LINE 486: they sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,
LINE 487: awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias
LINE 488: patiens ingemiscit_. To no end gathered; vainly then released,
LINE 489: forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of
LINE 490: lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws
LINE 491: a toil of waters.
LINE 492: Five fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he
LINE 493: said. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a
LINE 494: loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse
LINE 495: rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise
LINE 496: landward. There he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath
LINE 497: the watery floor. We have him. Easy now.
LINE 498: Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a
LINE 499: spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly. God
LINE 500: becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed
LINE 501: mountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a
LINE 502: urinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes
LINE 503: upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to
LINE 504: the sun.
LINE 505: A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths
LINE 506: known to man. Old Father Ocean. _Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.
LINE 507: Just you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.
LINE 508: Come. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?
LINE 509: Thunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,
LINE 510: _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_. No. My cockle hat and staff and
LINE 511: hismy sandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.
LINE 512: He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying
LINE 513: still. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make
LINE 514: their end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.
LINE 515: Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn
LINE 516: Tennyson, gentleman poet. _Già_. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.
LINE 517: And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. _Già_. My teeth are very
LINE 518: bad. Why, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to
LINE 519: a dentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch,
LINE 520: the superman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?
LINE 521: My handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?
LINE 522: His hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn't. Better buy one.
LINE 523: He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,
LINE 524: carefully. For the rest let look who will.
LINE 525: Behind. Perhaps there is someone.
LINE 526: He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the
LINE 527: air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the
LINE 528: crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.
LINE 529: — II —
