LINE 3: Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.
LINE 4: Horrid! And gold flushed more.
LINE 5: A husky fifenote blew.
LINE 6: Blew. Blue bloom is on the.
LINE 7: Goldpinnacled hair.
LINE 8: A jumping rose on satiny breast of satin, rose of Castile.
LINE 9: Trilling, trilling: Idolores.
LINE 10: Peep! Who's in the... peepofgold?
LINE 11: Tink cried to bronze in pity.
LINE 12: And a call, pure, long and throbbing. Longindying call.
LINE 13: Decoy. Soft word. But look: the bright stars fade. Notes chirruping
LINE 14: answer.
LINE 15: O rose! Castile. The morn is breaking.
LINE 16: Jingle jingle jaunted jingling.
LINE 17: Coin rang. Clock clacked.
LINE 18: Avowal. _Sonnez._ I could. Rebound of garter. Not leave thee. Smack.
LINE 19: _La cloche!_ Thigh smack. Avowal. Warm. Sweetheart, goodbye!
LINE 20: Jingle. Bloo.
LINE 21: Boomed crashing chords. When love absorbs. War! War! The tympanum.
LINE 22: A sail! A veil awave upon the waves.
LINE 23: Lost. Throstle fluted. All is lost now.
LINE 24: Horn. Hawhorn.
LINE 25: When first he saw. Alas!
LINE 26: Full tup. Full throb.
LINE 27: Warbling. Ah, lure! Alluring.

LINE 29: Clapclap. Clipclap. Clappyclap.

LINE 31: Deaf bald Pat brought pad knife took up.
LINE 32: A moonlit nightcall: far, far.
LINE 33: I feel so sad. P. S. So lonely blooming.
LINE 34: Listen!
LINE 35: The spiked and winding cold seahorn. Have you the? Each, and for other,
LINE 36: plash and silent roar.

LINE 49: Bronzelydia by Minagold.

LINE 61: Rrrpr. Kraa. Kraandl.
LINE 62: Then not till then. My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt.
LINE 63: Done.
LINE 64: Begin!
LINE 65: Bronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the
LINE 66: crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing
LINE 67: steel.
LINE 68: —Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.
LINE 69: Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._
LINE 70: —Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.
LINE 71: When all agog miss Douce said eagerly:
LINE 72: —Look at the fellow in the tall silk.
LINE 73: —Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.
LINE 74: —In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the
LINE 75: sun.
LINE 76: He's looking. Mind till I see.
LINE 77: She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against
LINE 78: the pane in a halo of hurried breath.
LINE 79: Her wet lips tittered:
LINE 80: —He's killed looking back.
LINE 81: She laughed:
LINE 82: —O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?
LINE 83: With sadness.
LINE 84: Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
LINE 85: behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
LINE 86: hair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.
LINE 87: —It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.
LINE 88: A man.
LINE 89: Bloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of
LINE 90: sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
LINE 91: Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
LINE 92: The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them
LINE 93: unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.
LINE 94: And
LINE 95: —There's your teas, he said.
LINE 96: Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
LINE 97: lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
LINE 98: —What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
LINE 99: —Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
LINE 100: —Your _beau,_ is it?
LINE 101: A haughty bronze replied:
LINE 102: —I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
LINE 103: impertinent insolence.
LINE 104: —Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
LINE 105: she threatened as he had come.
LINE 106: Bloom.
LINE 107: On her flower frowning miss Douce said:
LINE 108: —Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself
LINE 109: I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.
LINE 110: Ladylike in exquisite contrast.
LINE 111: —Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.
LINE 112: She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered
LINE 113: under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
LINE 114: waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black
LINE 115: satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
LINE 116: seven.
LINE 117: Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear,
LINE 118: hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.
LINE 119: —Am I awfully sunburnt?
LINE 120: Miss bronze unbloused her neck.
LINE 121: —No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with
LINE 122: the cherry laurel water?
LINE 123: Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
LINE 124: gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
LINE 125: midst a shell.
LINE 126: —And leave it to my hands, she said.
LINE 127: —Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.
LINE 128: Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
LINE 129: —Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that
LINE 130: old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.
LINE 131: Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
LINE 132: —O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!
LINE 133: —But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.
LINE 134: Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
LINE 135: with little fingers.
LINE 136: —No, don't, she cried.
LINE 137: —I won't listen, she cried.
LINE 138: But Bloom?
LINE 139: Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:
LINE 140: —For your what? says he.
LINE 141: Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
LINE 142: again:
LINE 143: —Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That
LINE 144: night in the Antient Concert Rooms.
LINE 145: She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
LINE 146: —Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
LINE 147: ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
LINE 148: Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce
LINE 149: huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
LINE 150: snout in quest.
LINE 151: —O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
LINE 152: Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
LINE 153: —And your other eye!
LINE 154: Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think
LINE 155: Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Loré's huguenot name. By
LINE 156: Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white
LINE 157: under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I
LINE 158: could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son.
LINE 159: He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of
LINE 160: fellows in: her white.
LINE 161: By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
LINE 162: Of sin.
LINE 163: In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
LINE 164: your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
LINE 165: freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
LINE 166: high piercing notes.
LINE 167: Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.
LINE 168: Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
LINE 169: gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
LINE 170: nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her
LINE 171: fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
LINE 172: spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
LINE 173: coughing with choking, crying:
LINE 174: —O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.
LINE 175: With his bit of beard!
LINE 176: Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
LINE 177: delight, joy, indignation.
LINE 178: —Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
LINE 179: Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
LINE 180: each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
LINE 181: shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I
LINE 182: knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
LINE 183: pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),
LINE 184: panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
LINE 185: Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.
LINE 186: —O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I
LINE 187: wished I hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.
LINE 188: —O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
LINE 189: And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
LINE 190: By Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of
LINE 191: their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at
LINE 192: doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I
LINE 193: want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands
LINE 194: turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I
LINE 195: net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet.
LINE 196: The sweets of sin.
LINE 197: Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
LINE 198: Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his
LINE 199: rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.
LINE 200: —O, welcome back, miss Douce.
LINE 201: He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
LINE 202: —Tiptop.
LINE 203: He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
LINE 204: —Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the
LINE 205: strand all day.
LINE 206: Bronze whiteness.
LINE 207: —That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
LINE 208: her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
LINE 209: Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.
LINE 210: —O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.
LINE 211: He was.
LINE 212: —Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they
LINE 213: christened me simple Simon.
LINE 214: —You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the
LINE 215: doctor order today?
LINE 216: —Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble
LINE 217: you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
LINE 218: Jingle.
LINE 219: —With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
LINE 220: With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's
LINE 221: she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
LINE 222: her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
LINE 223: pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky
LINE 224: fifenotes.
LINE 225: —By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be
LINE 226: a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at
LINE 227: last, they say. Yes. Yes.
LINE 228: Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into
LINE 229: the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.
LINE 230: None nought said nothing. Yes.
LINE 231: Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
LINE 232: —_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_
LINE 233: —Was Mr Lidwell in today?
LINE 234: In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex
LINE 235: bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.
LINE 236: Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on
LINE 237: the rye.
LINE 238: —He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
LINE 239: Lenehan came forward.
LINE 240: —Was Mr Boylan looking for me?
LINE 241: He asked. She answered:
LINE 242: —Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
LINE 243: She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
LINE 244: gaze upon a page:
LINE 245: —No. He was not.
LINE 246: Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the
LINE 247: sandwichbell wound his round body round.
LINE 248: —Peep! Who's in the corner?
LINE 249: No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her
LINE 250: stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.
LINE 251: Jingle jaunty jingle.
LINE 252: Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no
LINE 253: notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
LINE 254: —Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
LINE 255: bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?
LINE 256: He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
LINE 257: He sighed aside:
LINE 258: —Ah me! O my!
LINE 259: He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.
LINE 260: —Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.
LINE 261: —Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.
LINE 262: Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
LINE 263: —Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.
LINE 264: Dry.
LINE 265: Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.
LINE 266: —I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is
LINE 267: keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?
LINE 268: He had.
LINE 269: —I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In
LINE 270: Mooney's _en ville_ and in Mooney's _sur mer._ He had received the
LINE 271: rhino for the labour of his muse.
LINE 272: He smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
LINE 273: —The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh
LINE 274: MacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel
LINE 275: boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of
LINE 276: the O'Madden Burke.
LINE 277: After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
LINE 278: —That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.
LINE 279: He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his
LINE 280: glass.
LINE 281: He looked towards the saloon door.
LINE 282: —I see you have moved the piano.
LINE 283: —The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
LINE 284: concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
LINE 285: —Is that a fact?
LINE 286: —Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,
LINE 287: poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.
LINE 288: —Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.
LINE 289: He drank and strayed away.
LINE 290: —So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.
LINE 291: God's curse on bitch's bastard.
LINE 292: Tink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and
LINE 293: diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of
LINE 294: Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
LINE 295: With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for
LINE 296: jinglejaunty blazes boy.
LINE 297: Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the
LINE 298: oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed
LINE 299: indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the
LINE 300: thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in
LINE 301: action.
LINE 302: Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in
LINE 303: Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not
LINE 304: happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means
LINE 305: something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is.
LINE 306: Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom
LINE 307: eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.
LINE 308: Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For
LINE 309: some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat
LINE 310: riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.
LINE 311: Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.
LINE 312: Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.
LINE 313: —Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
LINE 314: —Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...
LINE 315: —And four.
LINE 316: At four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.
LINE 317: Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.
LINE 318: For men.
LINE 319: In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.
LINE 320: From the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the
LINE 321: tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now
LINE 322: poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
LINE 323: and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.
LINE 324: Pat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and
LINE 325: popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss
LINE 326: Douce.
LINE 327: —_The bright stars fade_...
LINE 328: A voiceless song sang from within, singing:
LINE 329: —... _the morn is breaking._
LINE 330: A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
LINE 331: hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
LINE 332: called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's
LINE 333: leavetaking, life's, love's morn.
LINE 334: —_The dewdrops pearl_...
LINE 335: Lenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
LINE 336: —But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.
LINE 337: Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.
LINE 338: She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,
LINE 339: dreamily rose.
LINE 340: —Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.
LINE 341: She answered, slighting:
LINE 342: —Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.
LINE 343: Like lady, ladylike.
LINE 344: Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he
LINE 345: strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and
LINE 346: knew and hailed him:
LINE 347: —See the conquering hero comes.
LINE 348: Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
LINE 349: hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat
LINE 350: walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.
LINE 351: —_And I from thee_...
LINE 352: —I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
LINE 353: He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled
LINE 354: on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
LINE 355: hair, a bosom and a rose.
LINE 356: Smart Boylan bespoke potions.
LINE 357: —What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a
LINE 358: sloegin for me. Wire in yet?
LINE 359: Not yet. At four she. Who said four?
LINE 360: Cowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's
LINE 361: office.
LINE 362: Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.
LINE 363: Wait.
LINE 364: Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,
LINE 365: Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.
LINE 366: See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom
LINE 367: followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
LINE 368: Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
LINE 369: bust, that all but burst, so high.
LINE 370: —O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
LINE 371: But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
LINE 372: —Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
LINE 373: Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
LINE 374: lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
LINE 375: syrupped with her voice:
LINE 376: —Fine goods in small parcels.
LINE 377: That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
LINE 378: —Here's fortune, Blazes said.
LINE 379: He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.
LINE 380: —Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...
LINE 381: —Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
LINE 382: —Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
LINE 383: —I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you
LINE 384: know. Fancy of a friend of mine.
LINE 385: Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's
LINE 386: lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
LINE 387: Idolores. The eastern seas.
LINE 388: Clock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
LINE 389: bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.
LINE 390: Miss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It
LINE 391: clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
LINE 392: and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For
LINE 393: me.
LINE 394: —What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
LINE 395: O'clock.
LINE 396: Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged
LINE 397: Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.
LINE 398: —Let's hear the time, he said.
LINE 399: The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered
LINE 400: tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table
LINE 401: near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not
LINE 402: come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
LINE 403: Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.
LINE 404: —Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.
LINE 405: —... _to Flora's lips did hie._
LINE 406: High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.
LINE 407: Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes
LINE 408: Boylan's flower and eyes.
LINE 409: —Please, please.
LINE 410: He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
LINE 411: —_I could not leave thee_...
LINE 412: —Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
LINE 413: —No, now, urged Lenehan. _Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There's no-one.
LINE 414: She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling
LINE 415: faces watched her bend.
LINE 416: Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
LINE 417: and lost and found it, faltering.
LINE 418: —Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_
LINE 419: Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted
LINE 420: them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
LINE 421: _—Sonnez!_
LINE 422: Smack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
LINE 423: smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.
LINE 424: —_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust
LINE 425: there.
LINE 426: She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward
LINE 427: gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
LINE 428: —You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
LINE 429: Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
LINE 430: chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound
LINE 431: eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
LINE 432: mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses
LINE 433: shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with
LINE 434: sunnier bronze.
LINE 435: Yes, bronze from anearby.
LINE 436: —... _Sweetheart, goodbye!_
LINE 437: —I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.
LINE 438: He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
LINE 439: —Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
LINE 440: Tom Rochford...
LINE 441: —Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
LINE 442: Lenehan gulped to go.
LINE 443: —Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.
LINE 444: He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
LINE 445: threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
LINE 446: —How do you do, Mr Dollard?
LINE 447: —Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an
LINE 448: instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob.
LINE 449: Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in
LINE 450: that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.
LINE 451: Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an
LINE 452: eyelid.
LINE 453: —Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a
LINE 454: ditty. We heard the piano.
LINE 455: Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.
LINE 456: And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now.
LINE 457: How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat.
LINE 458: Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
LINE 459: —What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.
LINE 460: —Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.
LINE 461: He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
LINE 462: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His
LINE 463: gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
LINE 464: Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted
LINE 465: Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.
LINE 466: Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
LINE 467: Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom
LINE 468: sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle.
LINE 469: Hear.
LINE 470: —Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.
LINE 471: Miss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind,
LINE 472: smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting
LINE 473: light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down
LINE 474: pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar
LINE 475: where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast
LINE 476: inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of
LINE 477: shadow, _eau de Nil._
LINE 478: —Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded
LINE 479: them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the
LINE 480: Collard grand.
LINE 481: There was.
LINE 482: —A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him.
LINE 483: He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
LINE 484: —God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the
LINE 485: punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
LINE 486: They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding
LINE 487: garment.
LINE 488: —Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's
LINE 489: my pipe, by the way?
LINE 490: He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried
LINE 491: two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.
LINE 492: —I saved the situation, Ben, I think.
LINE 493: —You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too.
LINE 494: That was a brilliant idea, Bob.
LINE 495: Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the
LINE 496: situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.
LINE 497: —I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in
LINE 498: the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and
LINE 499: who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you
LINE 500: remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap
LINE 501: in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember?
LINE 502: Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.
LINE 503: —By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
LINE 504: Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
LINE 505: —Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He
LINE 506: wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats
LINE 507: and boleros and trunkhose. What?
LINE 508: —Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of
LINE 509: all descriptions.
LINE 510: Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
LINE 511: Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.
LINE 512: Mrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice
LINE 513: name he.
LINE 514: —What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...
LINE 515: —Tweedy.
LINE 516: —Yes. Is she alive?
LINE 517: —And kicking.
LINE 518: —She was a daughter of...
LINE 519: —Daughter of the regiment.
LINE 520: —Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.
LINE 521: Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after
LINE 522: —Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?
LINE 523: Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.
LINE 524: —Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish
LINE 525: Molly, O.
LINE 526: He puffed a pungent plumy blast.
LINE 527: —From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.
LINE 528: They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by
LINE 529: maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,
LINE 530: Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.
LINE 531: Pat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before
LINE 532: he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes
LINE 533: while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then
LINE 534: kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.
LINE 535: Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.
LINE 536: By Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in
LINE 537: heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:
LINE 538: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you
LINE 539: the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.
LINE 540: Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding
LINE 541: chords:
LINE 542: —_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...
LINE 543: Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.
LINE 544: —War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.
LINE 545: —So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or
LINE 546: money.
LINE 547: He stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.
LINE 548: —Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said
LINE 549: through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.
LINE 550: In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.
LINE 551: —Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben.
LINE 552: _Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.
LINE 553: Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She
LINE 554: passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful
LINE 555: weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant
LINE 556: was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say.
LINE 557: But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She
LINE 558: waved about her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord
LINE 559: lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much
LINE 560: trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that.
LINE 561: Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.
LINE 562: —............ _my ardent soul
LINE 563: I care not foror the morrow._
LINE 564: In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is.
LINE 565: Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit
LINE 566: for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers.
LINE 567: Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed,
LINE 568: screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,
LINE 569: I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so
LINE 570: many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For
LINE 571: instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley.
LINE 572: Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap.
LINE 573: Stopped.
LINE 574: Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George
LINE 575: Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a
LINE 576: lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the
LINE 577: old dingdong again.
LINE 578: —Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.
LINE 579: George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.
LINE 580: Bloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the
LINE 581: Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,
LINE 582: flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do.
LINE 583: Best value in Dub.
LINE 584: Piano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,
LINE 585: mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the
LINE 586: bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.
LINE 587: Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus,
LINE 588: between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.
LINE 589: Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide
LINE 590: them.
LINE 591: Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.
LINE 592: Only the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a
LINE 593: lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that
LINE 594: once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their
LINE 595: harps. I. He. Old. Young.
LINE 596: —Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.
LINE 597: Strongly.
LINE 598: —Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.
LINE 599: —_M'appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.
LINE 600: Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long
LINE 601: arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly
LINE 602: he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a
LINE 603: ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave
LINE 604: upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.
LINE 605: Cowley sang:
LINE 606: _—M'appari tutt'amor:
LINE 607: Il mio sguardo l'incontr..._
LINE 608: She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to
LINE 609: wind, love, speeding sail, return.
LINE 610: —Go on, Simon.
LINE 611: —Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...
LINE 612: Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,
LINE 613: touched the obedient keys.
LINE 614: —No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.
LINE 615: The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.
LINE 616: Up stage strode Father Cowley.
LINE 617: —Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.
LINE 618: By Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged.
LINE 619: Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom
LINE 620: and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.
LINE 621: Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He
LINE 622: heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way.
LINE 623: Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.
LINE 624: Never forget it. Never.
LINE 625: Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.
LINE 626: Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying
LINE 627: the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off
LINE 628: awhile. Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate. Kidney pie.
LINE 629: Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in.
LINE 630: Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the
LINE 631: glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then
LINE 632: squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a
LINE 633: farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.
LINE 634: Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In
LINE 635: the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.
LINE 636: Speech paused on Richie's lips.
LINE 637: Coming out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his
LINE 638: own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.
LINE 639: —Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.
LINE 640: —_All is lost now_.
LINE 641: Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee
LINE 642: murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth
LINE 643: he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two
LINE 644: notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my
LINE 645: motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in
LINE 646: all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now.
LINE 647: Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.
LINE 648: Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.
LINE 649: Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence
LINE 650: in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call
LINE 651: name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's
LINE 652: why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.
LINE 653: —A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.
LINE 654: Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.
LINE 655: He knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise
LINE 656: child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?
LINE 657: Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking
LINE 658: Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his
LINE 659: eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I
LINE 660: did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
LINE 661: Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.
LINE 662: Stopped again.
LINE 663: Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.
LINE 664: —With it, Simon.
LINE 665: —It, Simon.
LINE 666: —Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind
LINE 667: solicitations.
LINE 668: —It, Simon.
LINE 669: —I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall
LINE 670: endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.
LINE 671: By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a
LINE 672: lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina
LINE 673: to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.
LINE 674: The harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,
LINE 675: drew a voice away.
LINE 676: —_When first I saw that form endearing_...
LINE 677: Richie turned.
LINE 678: —Si Dedalus' voice, he said.
LINE 679: Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow
LINE 680: endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to
LINE 681: Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the
LINE 682: bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited,
LINE 683: waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.
LINE 684: —_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._
LINE 685: Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves
LINE 686: in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem
LINE 687: dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their
LINE 688: each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each
LINE 689: seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw,
LINE 690: lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect
LINE 691: it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.
LINE 692: Love that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the
LINE 693: elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet _sonnez la_ gold. Bloom
LINE 694: wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound
LINE 695: it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.
LINE 696: —_Full of hope and all delighted_...
LINE 697: Tenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his
LINE 698: feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He
LINE 699: can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.
LINE 700: What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last
LINE 701: look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How
LINE 702: do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,
LINE 703: in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.
LINE 704: Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.
LINE 705: —_But alas, 'twas idle dreaming_...
LINE 706: Glorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly
LINE 707: man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his
LINE 708: wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he
LINE 709: doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing
LINE 710: too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind
LINE 711: soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.
LINE 712: Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the
LINE 713: chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.
LINE 714: Words? Music? No: it's what's behind.
LINE 715: Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.
LINE 716: Bloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music
LINE 717: out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her
LINE 718: tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy
LINE 719: the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,
LINE 720: gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.
LINE 721: —... _ray of hope is_...
LINE 722: Beaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse
LINE 723: unsqueaked a ray of hopk.
LINE 724: _Martha_ it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song. Lovely
LINE 725: name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her
LINE 726: heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still
LINE 727: the name: Martha. How strange! Today.
LINE 728: The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to
LINE 729: Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to
LINE 730: wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,
LINE 731: how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.
LINE 732: Wish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in
LINE 733: Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still
LINE 734: hear it better here than in the bar though farther.
LINE 735: —_Each graceful look_...
LINE 736: First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow,
LINE 737: black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.
LINE 738: Fate. Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down
LINE 739: she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.
LINE 740: —_Charmed my eye_...
LINE 741: Singing. _Waiting_ she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume
LINE 742: of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat
LINE 743: warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy
LINE 744: eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in
LINE 745: shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.
LINE 746: —_Martha! Ah, Martha!_
LINE 747: Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant
LINE 748: to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In
LINE 749: cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For
LINE 750: only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where.
LINE 751: Somewhere.
LINE 752: —_Co-ome, thou lost one!
LINE 753: Co-ome, thou dear one!_
LINE 754: Alone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!
LINE 755: _—Come!_
LINE 756: It soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver
LINE 757: orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out
LINE 758: too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high
LINE 759: resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high,
LINE 760: of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere
LINE 761: all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...
LINE 762: —_To me!_
LINE 763: Siopold!
LINE 764: Consumed.
LINE 765: Come. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to
LINE 766: her, you too, me, us.
LINE 767: —Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap
LINE 768: clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap,

LINE 770: Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent
LINE 771: with tank and bronze Miss Douce and gold Miss Mina.
LINE 772: Blazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.
LINE 773: Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,
LINE 774: reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now.
LINE 775: Atrot, in heat, heatseated. _Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la._
LINE 776: Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too
LINE 777: slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.
LINE 778: An afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.
LINE 779: And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,
LINE 780: Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two
LINE 781: more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,
LINE 782: coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.
LINE 783: —Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd
LINE 784: sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.
LINE 785: Lionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy
LINE 786: served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired,
LINE 787: admired. But Bloom sang dumb.
LINE 788: Admiring.
LINE 789: Richie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered
LINE 790: one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang _'Twas rank and
LINE 791: fame_: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life
LINE 792: a note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so
LINE 793: clear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice
LINE 794: lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.
LINE 795: Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the
LINE 796: night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang _'Twas rank and fame._
LINE 797: He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom,
LINE 798: of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing _'Twas rank and
LINE 799: fame_ in his, Ned Lambert's, house.
LINE 800: Brothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the
LINE 801: lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.
LINE 802: The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,
LINE 803: more than all others.
LINE 804: That voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you
LINE 805: feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.
LINE 806: Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the
LINE 807: slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While
LINE 808: Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan,
LINE 809: harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening
LINE 810: Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While
LINE 811: big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he
LINE 812: smoked, who smoked.
LINE 813: Thou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his
LINE 814: string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them
LINE 815: on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head.
LINE 816: Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling!
LINE 817: Five bob I gave. _Corpus paradisum._ Corncrake croaker: belly like a
LINE 818: poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too. And one day she with.
LINE 819: Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling
LINE 820: at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.
LINE 821: Yet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in
LINE 822: your? Twang. It snapped.
LINE 823: Jingle into Dorset street.
LINE 824: Miss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.
LINE 825: —Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.
LINE 826: George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.
LINE 827: First gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And
LINE 828: second tankard told her so. That that was so.
LINE 829: Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not
LINE 830: believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first:
LINE 831: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell:
LINE 832: the tank.
LINE 833: Better write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.
LINE 834: Bald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A
LINE 835: pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.
LINE 836: —Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.
LINE 837: Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is
LINE 838: this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,
LINE 839: envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.
LINE 840: —Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.
LINE 841: —It is, Bloom said.
LINE 842: Numbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two
LINE 843: divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus
LINE 844: two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling.
LINE 845: Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He
LINE 846: doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics.
LINE 847: And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it
LINE 848: like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall
LINE 849: quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.
LINE 850: Instance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till
LINE 851: you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then
LINE 852: hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over
LINE 853: barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune.
LINE 854: Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up
LINE 855: and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to
LINE 856: invent dummy pianos for that. _Blumenlied_ I bought for her. The name.
LINE 857: Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the
LINE 858: stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I
LINE 859: mean.
LINE 860: Bald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite
LINE 861: flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.
LINE 862: It was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy
LINE 863: in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles.
LINE 864: Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in
LINE 865: the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God,
LINE 866: such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.
LINE 867: Sour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a
LINE 868: moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.
LINE 869: Down the edge of his _Freeman_ baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye,
LINE 870: scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.
LINE 871: Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...
LINE 872: Hope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his _Freeman._
LINE 873: Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear
LINE 874: sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I
LINE 875: put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline _imposs._ To

LINE 877: Bore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting
LINE 878: fingers on flat pad Pat brought.
LINE 879: On. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres
LINE 880: enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the
LINE 881: gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a
LINE 882: crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you
LINE 883: despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught?
LINE 884: You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes,
LINE 885: yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other
LINE 886: world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must
LINE 887: believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.
LINE 888: Folly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives.
LINE 889: Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she
LINE 890: found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If
LINE 891: they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.
LINE 892: A hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James
LINE 893: of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young
LINE 894: gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George
LINE 895: Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing
LINE 896: a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great
LINE 897: Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and
LINE 898: jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a
LINE 899: gallantbuttocked mare.
LINE 900: —Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.
LINE 901: —Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.
LINE 902: Bloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You
LINE 903: know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he
LINE 904: playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will
LINE 905: you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I
LINE 906: want to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree.

LINE 909: lonely. Dee.
LINE 910: He blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper.
LINE 911: Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:
LINE 912: Miss Martha Clifford
LINE 913: c/o P. O.
LINE 914: Dolphin's Barn Lane
LINE 915: Dublin.
LINE 916: Blot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit.
LINE 917: Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea
LINE 918: per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U.
LINE 919: P: up.
LINE 920: Too poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms.
LINE 921: Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be.
LINE 922: Wisdom while you wait.
LINE 923: In Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is
LINE 924: all. One body. Do. But do.
LINE 925: Done anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now.
LINE 926: Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.
LINE 927: House of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.
LINE 928: Car near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins.
LINE 929: Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then
LINE 930: he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.
LINE 931: Bald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of
LINE 932: his hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee.
LINE 933: He waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He
LINE 934: waits while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you
LINE 935: wait. Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.
LINE 936: Douce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.
LINE 937: She had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell
LINE 938: she brought.
LINE 939: To the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding
LINE 940: seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.
LINE 941: —Listen! she bade him.
LINE 942: Under Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.
LINE 943: Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband
LINE 944: took him by the throat. _Scoundrel,_ said he, _You'll sing no more
LINE 945: lovesongs._ He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom.
LINE 946: Cowley lay back.
LINE 947: Ah, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard. Wonderful.
LINE 948: She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in
LINE 949: contrast glided. To hear.
LINE 950: Tap.
LINE 951: Bloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more
LINE 952: faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for
LINE 953: other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.
LINE 954: Bronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.
LINE 955: Her ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside.
LINE 956: Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream
LINE 957: first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget.
LINE 958: Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell
LINE 959: with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks
LINE 960: the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A
LINE 961: cave. No admittance except on business.
LINE 962: The sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse
LINE 963: in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.
LINE 964: Wonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur,
LINE 965: hearing: then laid it by, gently.
LINE 966: —What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.
LINE 967: Charming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.
LINE 968: Tap.
LINE 969: By Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan
LINE 970: turned.
LINE 971: From the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No,
LINE 972: she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know.
LINE 973: Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly
LINE 974: answered: with a gentleman friend.
LINE 975: Bob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord
LINE 976: has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a
LINE 977: light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling,
LINE 978: and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one,
LINE 979: one: two, one, three, four.
LINE 980: Sea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket,
LINE 981: cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere.
LINE 982: Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of _Don
LINE 983: Giovanni_ he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle
LINE 984: chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating
LINE 985: dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look
LINE 986: at us.
LINE 987: That's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other
LINE 988: joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows
LINE 989: you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt.
LINE 990: Then know.
LINE 991: M'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk.
LINE 992: Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage
LINE 993: men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark,
LINE 994: open. Molly in _quis est homo_: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to
LINE 995: hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.
LINE 996: Jog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue
LINE 997: clocks came light to earth.
LINE 998: O, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It
LINE 999: is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is.
LINE 1000: Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the
LINE 1001: resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the
LINE 1002: law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian,
LINE 1003: gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle.
LINE 1004: Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.
LINE 1005: One rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de
LINE 1006: Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock.
LINE 1007: Cockcock.
LINE 1008: Tap.
LINE 1009: —_Qui sdegno,_ Ben, said Father Cowley.
LINE 1010: —No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. _The Croppy Boy._ Our native Doric.
LINE 1011: —Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.
LINE 1012: —Do, do, they begged in one.
LINE 1013: I'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To
LINE 1014: me. How much?
LINE 1015: —What key? Six sharps?
LINE 1016: —F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.
LINE 1017: Bob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.
LINE 1018: Must go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must.
LINE 1019: Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He
LINE 1020: seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him
LINE 1021: twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family
LINE 1022: waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they
LINE 1023: wait.
LINE 1024: But wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the
LINE 1025: dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.
LINE 1026: The voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach
LINE 1027: and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men
LINE 1028: and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.
LINE 1029: Tap.
LINE 1030: Ben Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it.
LINE 1031: Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big
LINE 1032: ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships'
LINE 1033: lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh
LINE 1034: home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.
LINE 1035: The priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step
LINE 1036: in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.
LINE 1037: Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their
LINE 1038: days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.
LINE 1039: The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a
LINE 1040: lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them
LINE 1041: the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.
LINE 1042: Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in _Answers_, poets'
LINE 1043: picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting
LINE 1044: hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See
LINE 1045: blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner.
LINE 1046: Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.
LINE 1047: Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf
LINE 1048: Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.
LINE 1049: The chords harped slower.
LINE 1050: The voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.
LINE 1051: Ben's contrite beard confessed. _in nomine Domini,_ in God's name he
LINE 1052: knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: _mea culpa._
LINE 1053: Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion
LINE 1054: corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey,
LINE 1055: _corpusnomine._ Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.
LINE 1056: Tap.
LINE 1057: They listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well
LINE 1058: expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.
LINE 1059: The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed
LINE 1060: three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to
LINE 1061: play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he
LINE 1062: had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.
LINE 1063: Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't
LINE 1064: half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.
LINE 1065: Bronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face?
LINE 1066: They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.
LINE 1067: Cockcarracarra.
LINE 1068: What do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes.
LINE 1069: Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked
LINE 1070: that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain
LINE 1071: too. Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it
LINE 1072: sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses
LINE 1073: helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open
LINE 1074: crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.
LINE 1075: She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show.
LINE 1076: Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.
LINE 1077: Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised,
LINE 1078: listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down
LINE 1079: into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you
LINE 1080: must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the
LINE 1081: tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!
LINE 1082: All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his
LINE 1083: brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last
LINE 1084: of his name and race.
LINE 1085: I too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No
LINE 1086: son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?
LINE 1087: He bore no hate.
LINE 1088: Hate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old.
LINE 1089: Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush
LINE 1090: struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?
LINE 1091: Ireland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to
LINE 1092: speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.
LINE 1093: —_Bless me, father,_ Dollard the croppy cried. _Bless me and let me
LINE 1094: go._
LINE 1095: Tap.
LINE 1096: Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.
LINE 1097: Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those
LINE 1098: girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance.
LINE 1099: Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny
LINE 1100: Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name
LINE 1101: you.
LINE 1102: Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest
LINE 1103: rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all
LINE 1104: by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.
LINE 1105: Tap. Tap.
LINE 1106: Thrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.
LINE 1107: Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it:
LINE 1108: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young.
LINE 1109: Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white
LINE 1110: woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women.
LINE 1111: Goddess I didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he
LINE 1112: gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make
LINE 1113: her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that
LINE 1114: hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so
LINE 1115: like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of
LINE 1116: nature.
LINE 1117: Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?
LINE 1118: Will? You? I. Want. You. To.
LINE 1119: With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's
LINE 1120: bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live,
LINE 1121: your last.
LINE 1122: Tap. Tap.
LINE 1123: Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want
LINE 1124: to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs
LINE 1125: Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.
LINE 1126: A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes,
LINE 1127: calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On
LINE 1128: yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving
LINE 1129: embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath:
LINE 1130: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of
LINE 1131: maidenhair.
LINE 1132: But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha.
LINE 1133: Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from

LINE 1136: it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the
LINE 1137: polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and
LINE 1138: finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid
LINE 1139: so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding
LINE 1140: through their sliding ring.
LINE 1141: With a cock with a carra.
LINE 1142: Tap. Tap. Tap.
LINE 1143: I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.

LINE 1155: Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to
LINE 1156: dolorous prayer.
LINE 1157: By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,
LINE 1158: by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze
LINE 1159: and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so

LINE 1166: heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all
LINE 1167: treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill
LINE 1168: to wash it down. Glad I avoided.
LINE 1169: —Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you
LINE 1170: were.
LINE 1171: —Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad,
LINE 1172: upon my soul and honour it is.
LINE 1173: —Lablache, said Father Cowley.
LINE 1174: Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and

LINE 1185: person.
LINE 1186: Rrrrrrrsss.
LINE 1187: —Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.

LINE 1191: Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.
LINE 1192: —Mr Dollard, they murmured low.

LINE 1198: Dollard, yes.
LINE 1199: Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely,

LINE 1214: Tap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.
LINE 1215: Cowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way
LINE 1216: only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All
LINE 1217: ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time.
LINE 1218: Dotty. You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking
LINE 1219: shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.
LINE 1220: All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you

LINE 1222: Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys.
LINE 1223: Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself
LINE 1224: or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek
LINE 1225: cursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried),
LINE 1226: then all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.
LINE 1227: Pwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.
LINE 1228: —Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him

LINE 1235: forgot it when he was here.
LINE 1236: Blind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so

LINE 1241: I feel I want...

LINE 1252: But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation:
LINE 1253: Mickey Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home
LINE 1254: after pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing
LINE 1255: his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt
LINE 1256: them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be
LINE 1257: what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.
LINE 1258: Tap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by
LINE 1259: Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see)
LINE 1260: blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of
LINE 1261: all.
LINE 1262: Instruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb

LINE 1275: must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap.
LINE 1276: Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin.
LINE 1277: O, the whore of the lane!
LINE 1278: A frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the
LINE 1279: day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form
LINE 1280: endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn.

LINE 1293: to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to
LINE 1294: charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.
