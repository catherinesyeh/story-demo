LINE 1: _(The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an
LINE 2: uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green
LINE 3: will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of grimy houses with gaping
LINE 4: doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice
LINE 5: gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which
LINE 6: are wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter
LINE 7: slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on
LINE 8: through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and
LINE 9: answer.)_
LINE 10: THE CALLS: Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.
LINE 11: THE ANSWERS: Round behind the stable.
LINE 12: _(A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling,
LINE 13: jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children 's hands
LINE 14: imprisons him.)_
LINE 15: THE CHILDREN: Kithogue! Salute!
LINE 16: THE IDIOT: _(Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.)_ Grhahute!
LINE 17: THE CHILDREN: Where's the great light?
LINE 18: THE IDIOT: _(Gobbling.)_ Ghaghahest.
LINE 19: _(They release him. He jerks on. A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung
LINE 20: between two railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and
LINE 21: muffled by its arm and hat snores, groans, grinding growling teeth, and
LINE 22: snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to
LINE 23: shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky
LINE 24: oillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his
LINE 25: booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone
LINE 26: makes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the
LINE 27: doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts,
LINE 28: clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands
LINE 29: the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch
LINE 30: in shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A
LINE 31: plate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar,
LINE 32: mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit
LINE 33: by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the
LINE 34: hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings
LINE 35: shrill from a lane.)_
LINE 36: CISSY CAFFREY:
LINE 37: I gave it to Molly
LINE 38: Because she was jolly,

LINE 41: _(Private Carr and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their
LINE 42: oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from
LINE 43: their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse
LINE 44: virago retorts.)_
LINE 45: THE VIRAGO: Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.
LINE 46: CISSY CAFFREY: More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet. _(She
LINE 47: sings.)_
LINE 48: I gave it to Nelly
LINE 49: To stick in her belly,
LINE 50: The leg of the duck,
LINE 51: The leg of the duck.
LINE 52: _(Private Carr and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics
LINE 53: bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond cropped
LINE 54: polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the
LINE 55: redcoats.)_
LINE 56: PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Jerks his finger.)_ Way for the parson.
LINE 57: PRIVATE CARR: _(Turns and calls.)_ What ho, parson!
LINE 58: CISSY CAFFREY: _(Her voice soaring higher.)_
LINE 59: She has it, she got it,
LINE 60: Wherever she put it,
LINE 61: The leg of the duck.
LINE 62: _(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy
LINE 63: the_ introit _for paschal time. Lynch, his jockeycap low on his brow,
LINE 64: attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)_
LINE 65: STEPHEN: _Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia_.
LINE 66: _(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a
LINE 67: doorway.)_
LINE 68: THE BAWD: _(Her voice whispering huskily.)_ Sst! Come here till I tell
LINE 69: you. Maidenhead inside. Sst!
LINE 70: STEPHEN: _(Altius aliquantulum.) Et omnes ad quos pervenit aqua ista_.
LINE 71: THE BAWD: _(Spits in their trail her jet of venom.)_ Trinity medicals.
LINE 72: Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.
LINE 73: _(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl
LINE 74: across her nostrils.)_
LINE 75: EDY BOARDMAN: _(Bickering.)_ And says the one: I seen you up Faithful
LINE 76: place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his
LINE 77: cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You
LINE 78: never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The
LINE 79: likes of her! Stag that one is! Stubborn as a mule! And her walking
LINE 80: with two fellows the one time, Kilbride, the enginedriver, and
LINE 81: lancecorporal Oliphant.
LINE 82: STEPHEN: _(Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti sunt._
LINE 83: _(He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering
LINE 84: light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks
LINE 85: after him, growling. Lynch scares it with a kick.)_
LINE 86: LYNCH: So that?
LINE 87: STEPHEN: (_Looks behind_.) So that gesture, not music not odour, would
LINE 88: be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the
LINE 89: lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.
LINE 90: LYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburgh street!
LINE 91: STEPHEN: We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even
LINE 92: the allwisest Stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of
LINE 93: love.
LINE 94: LYNCH: Ba!
LINE 95: STEPHEN: Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug?
LINE 96: This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread or wine in Omar.
LINE 97: Hold my stick.
LINE 98: LYNCH: Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?
LINE 99: STEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, to _la belle dame sans merci,_ Georgina
LINE 100: Johnson, _ad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam._
LINE 101: _(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands,
LINE 102: his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down
LINE 103: turned, in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left
LINE 104: being higher.)_
LINE 105: LYNCH: Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the
LINE 106: customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.
LINE 107: _(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs
LINE 108: in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to
LINE 109: climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the
LINE 110: dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his
LINE 111: nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot.
LINE 112: Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his
LINE 113: flaring cresset._
LINE 114: _Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools,
LINE 115: middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south
LINE 116: beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy, staggering forward,
LINE 117: cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther
LINE 118: side under the railway bridge Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming
LINE 119: bread and chocolate into a sidepocket. From Gillen's hairdresser's
LINE 120: window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave
LINE 121: mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru
LINE 122: Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. He passes,
LINE 123: struck by the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror
LINE 124: grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the
LINE 125: rixdix doldy._
LINE 126: _At Antonio Rabaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright
LINE 127: arclamp. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)_
LINE 128: BLOOM: Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!
LINE 129: _(He disappears into Olhausen's, the porkbutcher's, under the
LINE 130: downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the
LINE 131: shutter, puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a
LINE 132: parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold
LINE 133: sheep's trotter, sprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing
LINE 134: upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his ribs
LINE 135: and groans.)_
LINE 136: BLOOM: Stitch in my side. Why did I run?
LINE 137: _(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset
LINE 138: siding. The glow leaps again.)_
LINE 139: BLOOM: What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.
LINE 140: _(He stands at Cormack's corner, watching.)_
LINE 141: BLOOM: _Aurora borealis_ or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of
LINE 142: course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's
LINE 143: bush. We're safe. _(He hums cheerfully.)_ London's burning, London's
LINE 144: burning! On fire, on fire! (_He catches sight of the navvy lurching
LINE 145: through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street._) I'll miss
LINE 146: him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.
LINE 147: _(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)_
LINE 148: THE URCHINS: Mind out, mister!
LINE 149: (_Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him,
LINE 150: grazing him, their bells rattling._)
LINE 151: THE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.
LINE 152: BLOOM: _(Halts erect, stung by a spasm.)_ Ow!
LINE 153: _(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon
LINE 154: sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its
LINE 155: huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The
LINE 156: motorman bangs his footgong.)_
LINE 157: THE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.
LINE 158: _(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved
LINE 159: hand, blunders stifflegged out of the track. The motorman, thrown
LINE 160: forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over
LINE 161: chains and keys.)_
LINE 162: THE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?
LINE 163: _(Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a
LINE 164: mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.)_
LINE 165: BLOOM: No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must
LINE 166: take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against
LINE 167: street accident too. The Providential. _(He feels his trouser pocket.)_
LINE 168: Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog.
LINE 169: Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's
LINE 170: corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought
LINE 171: to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked
LINE 172: me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of
LINE 173: him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful
LINE 174: cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why?
LINE 175: Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. _(He closes his eyes an
LINE 176: instant.)_ Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other.
LINE 177: Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!
LINE 178: _(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirne's wall, a
LINE 179: visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved
LINE 180: sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)_
LINE 181: BLOOM: _Buenas noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?_
LINE 182: THE FIGURE: (_Impassive, raises a signal arm._) Password. _Sraid
LINE 183: Mabbot._
LINE 184: BLOOM: Haha. _Merci._ Esperanto. _Slan leath. (He mutters.)_ Gaelic
LINE 185: league spy, sent by that fireeater.
LINE 186: _(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps
LINE 187: left, ragsackman left.)_
LINE 188: BLOOM: I beg.
LINE 189: (_He leaps right, sackragman right._)
LINE 190: BLOOM: I beg.
LINE 191: (_He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on._)
LINE 192: BLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a signpost planted
LINE 193: by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who
LINE 194: lost my way and contributed to the columns of the _Irish Cyclist_ the
LINE 195: letter headed _In darkest Stepaside_. Keep, keep, keep to the right.
LINE 196: Rags and bones at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer
LINE 197: makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.
LINE 198: _(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against
LINE 199: Bloom.)_
LINE 200: BLOOM: O.
LINE 201: _(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.
LINE 202: Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket,
LINE 203: pursepoke, sweets of sin, potato soap.)_
LINE 204: BLOOM: Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch
LINE 205: your purse.
LINE 206: _(The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. A sprawled
LINE 207: form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long
LINE 208: caftan of an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels.
LINE 209: Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison
LINE 210: streaks are on the drawn face.)_
LINE 211: RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with
LINE 212: drunken goy ever. So you catch no money.
LINE 213: BLOOM: _(Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and,
LINE 214: crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat.) Ja, ich weiss, papachi._
LINE 215: RUDOLPH: What you making down this place? Have you no soul? _(With
LINE 216: feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom.)_ Are you not
LINE 217: my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son
LINE 218: Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his
LINE 219: fathers Abraham and Jacob?
LINE 220: BLOOM: _(With precaution.)_ I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's
LINE 221: left of him.
LINE 222: RUDOLPH: _(Severely.)_ One night they bring you home drunk as dog after
LINE 223: spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?
LINE 224: BLOOM: _(In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips,
LINE 225: narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver
LINE 226: waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one
LINE 227: side of him coated with stiffening mud.)_ Harriers, father. Only that
LINE 228: once.
LINE 229: RUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make
LINE 230: you kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.
LINE 231: BLOOM: _(Weakly.)_ They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I
LINE 232: slipped.
LINE 233: RUDOLPH: _(With contempt.) Goim nachez!_ Nice spectacles for your poor
LINE 234: mother!
LINE 235: BLOOM: Mamma!
LINE 236: ELLEN BLOOM: _(In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, widow Twankey's
LINE 237: crinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind,
LINE 238: grey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net,
LINE 239: appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her
LINE 240: hand, and cries out in shrill alarm.)_ O blessed Redeemer, what have
LINE 241: they done to him! My smelling salts! _(She hauls up a reef of skirt and
LINE 242: ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus
LINE 243: Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.)_ Sacred Heart
LINE 244: of Mary, where were you at all at all?
LINE 245: _(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in
LINE 246: his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)_
LINE 247: A VOICE: _(Sharply.)_ Poldy!
LINE 248: BLOOM: Who? _(He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.)_ At your
LINE 249: service.
LINE 250: _(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in
LINE 251: Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet
LINE 252: trousers and jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund
LINE 253: girdles her. A white yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face,
LINE 254: leaving free only her large dark eyes and raven hair.)_
LINE 255: BLOOM: Molly!
LINE 256: MARION: Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to
LINE 257: me. _(Satirically.)_ Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?
LINE 258: BLOOM: _(Shifts from foot to foot.)_ No, no. Not the least little bit.
LINE 259: _(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions,
LINE 260: hopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire,
LINE 261: spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled
LINE 262: toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a
LINE 263: camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of
LINE 264: innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with
LINE 265: disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb
LINE 266: wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)_
LINE 267: MARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!
LINE 268: _(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,
LINE 269: offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops
LINE 270: his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom
LINE 271: stoops his back for leapfrog.)_
LINE 272: BLOOM: I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer... Mrs
LINE 273: Marion... if you...
LINE 274: MARION: So you notice some change? _(Her hands passing slowly over her
LINE 275: trinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.)_ O Poldy,
LINE 276: Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the
LINE 277: wide world.
LINE 278: BLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower
LINE 279: water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the
LINE 280: morning. _(He pats divers pockets.)_ This moving kidney. Ah!
LINE 281: _(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon
LINE 282: soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)_
LINE 283: THE SOAP:
LINE 284: We're a capital couple are Bloom and I.
LINE 285: He brightens the earth. I polish the sky.
LINE 286: _(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the
LINE 287: soapsun.)_
LINE 288: SWENY: Three and a penny, please.
LINE 289: BLOOM: Yes. For my wife. Mrs Marion. Special recipe.
LINE 290: MARION: _(Softly.)_ Poldy!
LINE 291: BLOOM: Yes, ma'am?
LINE 292: MARION: _Ti trema un poco il cuore?_
LINE 293: _(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,
LINE 294: humming the duet from_ Don Giovanni.)
LINE 295: BLOOM: Are you sure about that _Voglio_? I mean the pronunciati...
LINE 296: _(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes
LINE 297: his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)_
LINE 298: THE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.
LINE 299: Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.
LINE 300: _(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled,
LINE 301: Bridie Kelly stands.)_
LINE 302: BRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?
LINE 303: _(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues
LINE 304: with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into
LINE 305: gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)_
LINE 306: THE BAWD: _(Her wolfeyes shining.)_ He's getting his pleasure. You
LINE 307: won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all
LINE 308: night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.
LINE 309: _(Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind,
LINE 310: ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)_
LINE 311: GERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. _(She murmurs.)_ You
LINE 312: did that. I hate you.
LINE 313: BLOOM: I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.
LINE 314: THE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman
LINE 315: false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother
LINE 316: take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.
LINE 317: GERTY: _(To Bloom.)_ When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.
LINE 318: _(She paws his sleeve, slobbering.)_ Dirty married man! I love you for
LINE 319: doing that to me.
LINE 320: _(She glides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with
LINE 321: loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes
LINE 322: wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)_
LINE 323: MRS BREEN: Mr...
LINE 324: BLOOM: _(Coughs gravely.)_ Madam, when we last had this pleasure by
LINE 325: letter dated the sixteenth instant...
LINE 326: MRS BREEN: Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you
LINE 327: nicely! Scamp!
LINE 328: BLOOM: _(Hurriedly.)_ Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me?
LINE 329: Don't give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It's ages since I.
LINE 330: You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are
LINE 331: having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here.
LINE 332: Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the
LINE 333: secretary...
LINE 334: MRS BREEN: _(Holds up a finger.)_ Now, don't tell a big fib! I know
LINE 335: somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! _(Slily.)_
LINE 336: Account for yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!
LINE 337: BLOOM: _(Looks behind.)_ She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming.
LINE 338: The exotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money.
LINE 339: Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at
LINE 340: the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.
LINE 341: _(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,
LINE 342: upstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes,
LINE 343: leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands
LINE 344: jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they
LINE 345: rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to
LINE 346: back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)_
LINE 347: TOM AND SAM:
LINE 348: There's someone in the house with Dina
LINE 349: There's someone in the house, I know,
LINE 350: There's someone in the house with Dina
LINE 351: Playing on the old banjo.
LINE 352: _(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling,
LINE 353: chortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance
LINE 354: away.)_
LINE 355: BLOOM: _(With a sour tenderish smile.)_ A little frivol, shall we, if
LINE 356: you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for
LINE 357: a fraction of a second?
LINE 358: MRS BREEN: _(Screams gaily.)_ O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!
LINE 359: BLOOM: For old sake' sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed
LINE 360: marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a
LINE 361: soft corner for you. _(Gloomily.)_ 'Twas I sent you that valentine of
LINE 362: the dear gazelle.
LINE 363: MRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. _(She
LINE 364: puts out her hand inquisitively.)_ What are you hiding behind your
LINE 365: back? Tell us, there's a dear.
LINE 366: BLOOM: _(Seizes her wrist with his free hand.)_ Josie Powell that was,
LINE 367: prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking
LINE 368: back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina
LINE 369: Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game,
LINE 370: finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this
LINE 371: snuffbox?
LINE 372: MRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic
LINE 373: recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with
LINE 374: the ladies.
LINE 375: BLOOM: _(Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings,
LINE 376: blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl

LINE 378: gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.
LINE 379: MRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.
LINE 380: BLOOM: _(Meaningfully dropping his voice.)_ I confess I'm teapot with
LINE 381: curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little
LINE 382: teapot at present.
LINE 383: MRS BREEN: _(Gushingly.)_ Tremendously teapot! London's teapot and I'm
LINE 384: simply teapot all over me! _(She rubs sides with him.)_ After the
LINE 385: parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the
LINE 386: staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.
LINE 387: BLOOM: _(Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his
LINE 388: fingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm
LINE 389: which she surrenders gently.)_ The witching hour of night. I took the
LINE 390: splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. _(Tenderly, as he slips
LINE 391: on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano._
LINE 392: MRS BREEN: _(In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a
LINE 393: tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her
LINE 394: moonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.)
LINE 395: Voglio e non._ You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the
LINE 396: heart.
LINE 397: BLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and
LINE 398: the beast. I can never forgive you for that. _(His clenched fist at his
LINE 399: brow.)_ Think what it means. All you meant to me then. _(Hoarsely.)_
LINE 400: Woman, it's breaking me!
LINE 401: _(Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwichboards,
LINE 402: shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out,
LINE 403: muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of
LINE 404: the ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)_
LINE 405: ALF BERGAN: _(Points jeering at the sandwichboards.)_ U. p: up.
LINE 406: MRS BREEN: _(To Bloom.)_ High jinks below stairs. _(She gives him the
LINE 407: glad eye.)_ Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted
LINE 408: to.
LINE 409: BLOOM: _(Shocked.)_ Molly's best friend! Could you?
LINE 410: MRS BREEN: _(Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.)_
LINE 411: Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?
LINE 412: BLOOM: _(Offhandedly.)_ Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without
LINE 413: potted meat is incomplete. I was at _Leah_, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.
LINE 414: Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the
LINE 415: programme. Rattling good place round there for pigs' feet. Feel.
LINE 416: _(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears
LINE 417: weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which
LINE 418: a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He opens it and
LINE 419: shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and
LINE 420: tightpacked pills.)_
LINE 421: RICHIE: Best value in Dub.
LINE 422: _(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his
LINE 423: napkin, waiting to wait.)_
LINE 424: PAT: _(Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.)_ Steak and
LINE 425: kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.
LINE 426: RICHIE: Goodgod. Inev erate inall...
LINE 427: _(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching
LINE 428: by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)_
LINE 429: RICHIE: _(With a cry of pain, his hand to his back.)_ Ah! Bright's!
LINE 430: Lights!
LINE 431: BLOOM: _(Points to the navvy.)_ A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate
LINE 432: stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.
LINE 433: MRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and
LINE 434: bull story.
LINE 435: BLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.
LINE 436: But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular
LINE 437: reason.
LINE 438: MRS BREEN: _(All agog.)_ O, not for worlds.
LINE 439: BLOOM: Let's walk on. Shall us?
LINE 440: MRS BREEN: Let's.
LINE 441: _(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The
LINE 442: terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)_
LINE 443: THE BAWD: Jewman's melt!
LINE 444: BLOOM: _(In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,
LINE 445: tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white
LINE 446: spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in
LINE 447: bandolier and a grey billycock hat.)_ Do you remember a long long time,
LINE 448: years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was
LINE 449: weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?
LINE 450: MRS BREEN: _(In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider
LINE 451: veil.)_ Leopardstown.
LINE 452: BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three
LINE 453: year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old
LINE 454: fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and
LINE 455: you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur
LINE 456: that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to
LINE 457: nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and
LINE 458: I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...
LINE 459: MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!
LINE 460: BLOOM: Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other
LINE 461: ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I
LINE 462: admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though
LINE 463: it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a
LINE 464: thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.
LINE 465: MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was!
LINE 466: BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a
LINE 467: sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket.
LINE 468: Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much
LINE 469: for her style. She was...
LINE 470: MRS BREEN: Too...
LINE 471: BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly
LINE 472: were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius
LINE 473: Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter,
LINE 474: Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you
LINE 475: asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...
LINE 476: MRS BREEN: _(Eagerly.)_ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
LINE 477: _(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on
LINE 478: towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her
LINE 479: feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers
LINE 480: listen to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with
LINE 481: raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in
LINE 482: maimed sodden playfight.)_
LINE 483: THE GAFFER: _(Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.)_ And when
LINE 484: Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he
LINE 485: after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there
LINE 486: waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.
LINE 487: THE LOITERERS: _(Guffaw with cleft palates.)_ O jays!
LINE 488: _(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their
LINE 489: lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)_
LINE 490: BLOOM: Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad
LINE 491: daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.
LINE 492: THE LOITERERS: Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the
LINE 493: men's porter.
LINE 494: _(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled,
LINE 495: call from lanes, doors, corners.)_
LINE 496: THE WHORES:
LINE 497: Are you going far, queer fellow?
LINE 498: How's your middle leg?
LINE 499: Got a match on you?
LINE 500: Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.
LINE 501: _(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From
LINE 502: a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk.
LINE 503: In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two
LINE 504: redcoats.)_
LINE 505: THE NAVVY: _(Belching.)_ Where's the bloody house?
LINE 506: THE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout.
LINE 507: Respectable woman.
LINE 508: THE NAVVY: _(Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.)_
LINE 509: Come on, you British army!
LINE 510: PRIVATE CARR: _(Behind his back.)_ He aint half balmy.
LINE 511: PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Laughs.)_ What ho!
LINE 512: PRIVATE CARR: _(To the navvy.)_ Portobello barracks canteen. You ask
LINE 513: for Carr. Just Carr.
LINE 514: THE NAVVY: _(Shouts.)_
LINE 515: We are the boys. Of Wexford.
LINE 516: PRIVATE COMPTON: Say! What price the sergeantmajor?
LINE 517: PRIVATE CARR: Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.
LINE 518: THE NAVVY: _(Shouts.)_
LINE 519: The galling chain.
LINE 520: And free our native land.
LINE 521: _(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault.
LINE 522: The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)_
LINE 523: BLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they
LINE 524: are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at
LINE 525: Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far.
LINE 526: Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding
LINE 527: for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What
LINE 528: am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't
LINE 529: heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have
LINE 530: met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for
LINE 531: cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have
LINE 532: lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only
LINE 533: for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed
LINE 534: Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot.
LINE 535: Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages
LINE 536: for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff.
LINE 537: God help his gamekeeper.
LINE 538: _(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend_ Wet
LINE 539: Dream _and a phallic design._) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted
LINE 540: carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? _(Gaudy dollwomen loll in
LINE 541: the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye
LINE 542: cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow
LINE 543: round ovalling wreaths.)_
LINE 544: THE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.
LINE 545: BLOOM: My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get
LINE 546: all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too
LINE 547: much. _(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand,
LINE 548: wagging his tail.)_ Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today.
LINE 549: Better speak to him first. Like women they like _rencontres._ Stinks
LINE 550: like a polecat. _Chacun son goût_. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain
LINE 551: in his movements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! _(The
LINE 552: wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his
LINE 553: long black tongue lolling out.)_ Influence of his surroundings. Give
LINE 554: and have done with it. Provided nobody. _(Calling encouraging words he
LINE 555: shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into
LINE 556: a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the
LINE 557: crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.)_ Sizeable for
LINE 558: threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort.
LINE 559: Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.
LINE 560: _(With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The
LINE 561: mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling
LINE 562: greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent,
LINE 563: vigilant. They murmur together.)_
LINE 564: THE WATCH: Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.
LINE 565: _(Each lays hand on Bloom's shoulder.)_
LINE 566: FIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.
LINE 567: BLOOM: _(Stammers.)_ I am doing good to others.
LINE 568: _(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime
LINE 569: with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)_
LINE 570: THE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.
LINE 571: BLOOM: The friend of man. Trained by kindness.
LINE 572: _(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the
LINE 573: munching spaniel.)_
LINE 574: BOB DORAN: Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.
LINE 575: _(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig's knuckle
LINE 576: between his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran
LINE 577: falls silently into an area.)_
LINE 578: SECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.
LINE 579: BLOOM: _(Enthusiastically.)_ A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on
LINE 580: Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness
LINE 581: scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the
LINE 582: last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.
LINE 583: _(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs
LINE 584: in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a curling
LINE 585: carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging
LINE 586: boarhound.)_
LINE 587: SIGNOR MAFFEI: _(With a sinister smile.)_ Ladies and gentlemen, my
LINE 588: educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my
LINE 589: patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a
LINE 590: knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your
LINE 591: lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even _Leo ferox_ there, the
LINE 592: Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the
LINE 593: burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. _(He
LINE 594: glares.)_ I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with
LINE 595: these breastsparklers. _(With a bewitching smile.)_ I now introduce
LINE 596: Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.
LINE 597: FIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.
LINE 598: BLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! _(He takes off his
LINE 599: high grade hat, saluting.)_ Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have
LINE 600: heard of von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. _Donnerwetter!_ Owns half
LINE 601: Austria. Egypt. Cousin.
LINE 602: FIRST WATCH: Proof.
LINE 603: _(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)_
LINE 604: BLOOM: _(In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a
LINE 605: false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and
LINE 606: offers it.)_ Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors:
LINE 607: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.
LINE 608: FIRST WATCH: _(Reads.)_ Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully
LINE 609: watching and besetting.
LINE 610: SECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.
LINE 611: BLOOM: _(Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.)_ This
LINE 612: is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his
LINE 613: name. _(Plausibly.)_ You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom.
LINE 614: The change of name. Virag. _(He murmurs privately and confidentially.)_
LINE 615: We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement.
LINE 616: _(He shoulders the second watch gently.)_ Dash it all. It's a way we
LINE 617: gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. _(He turns gravely to
LINE 618: the first watch.)_ Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo
LINE 619: sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. _(To
LINE 620: the second watch gaily.)_ I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do
LINE 621: it in the shake of a lamb's tail.
LINE 622: _(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)_
LINE 623: THE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of
LINE 624: the army.
LINE 625: MARTHA: _(Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the_
LINE 626: Irish Times _in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.)_ Henry!
LINE 627: Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.
LINE 628: FIRST WATCH: _(Sternly.)_ Come to the station.
LINE 629: BLOOM: _(Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart
LINE 630: and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and
LINE 631: dueguard of fellowcraft.)_ No, no, worshipful master, light of love.
LINE 632: Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember
LINE 633: the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a
LINE 634: hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than
LINE 635: ninetynine wrongfully condemned.
LINE 636: MARTHA: _(Sobbing behind her veil.)_ Breach of promise. My real name is
LINE 637: Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my
LINE 638: brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.
LINE 639: BLOOM: _(Behind his hand.)_ She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. _(He
LINE 640: murmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim.)_ Shitbroleeth.
LINE 641: SECOND WATCH: _(Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.)_ You ought to be
LINE 642: thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.
LINE 643: BLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am
LINE 644: a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable
LINE 645: married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.
LINE 646: My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant
LINE 647: upstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,
LINE 648: one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his
LINE 649: majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.
LINE 650: FIRST WATCH: Regiment.
LINE 651: BLOOM: _(Turns to the gallery.)_ The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of
LINE 652: the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in
LINE 653: arms up there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan
LINE 654: police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body
LINE 655: of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.
LINE 656: A VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?
LINE 657: BLOOM: _(His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.)_ My old dad too
LINE 658: was a J. P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with
LINE 659: the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under general
LINE 660: Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was
LINE 661: mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. _(With quiet
LINE 662: feeling.)_ Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.
LINE 663: FIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.
LINE 664: BLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact
LINE 665: we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am
LINE 666: the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am
LINE 667: connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...
LINE 668: _(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His
LINE 669: scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a
LINE 670: hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a
LINE 671: telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)_
LINE 672: MYLES CRAWFORD: _(His cock's wattles wagging.)_ Hello, seventyseven
LINE 673: eightfour. Hello. _Freeman's Urinal_ and _Weekly Arsewipe_ here.
LINE 674: Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?
LINE 675: _(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate
LINE 676: morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing,
LINE 677: creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large
LINE 678: portfolio labelled_ Matcham's Masterstrokes.)
LINE 679: BEAUFOY: _(Drawls.)_ No, you aren't. Not by a long shot if I know it. I
LINE 680: don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most
LINE 681: rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly
LINE 682: loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak
LINE 683: masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most
LINE 684: inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really
LINE 685: gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath
LINE 686: suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which
LINE 687: your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout
LINE 688: the kingdom.
LINE 689: BLOOM: _(Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.)_ That bit about the
LINE 690: laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...
LINE 691: BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You
LINE 692: funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't
LINE 693: think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.
LINE 694: My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord,
LINE 695: we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are
LINE 696: considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this
LINE 697: jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.
LINE 698: BLOOM: _(Indistinctly.)_ University of life. Bad art.
LINE 699: BEAUFOY: _(Shouts.)_ It's a damnably foul lie, showing the moral
LINE 700: rottenness of the man! _(He extends his portfolio.)_ We have here
LINE 701: damning evidence, the _corpus delicti_, my lord, a specimen of my
LINE 702: maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.
LINE 703: A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:
LINE 704: Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
LINE 705: Wiped his arse in the _Daily News_.
LINE 706: BLOOM: _(Bravely.)_ Overdrawn.
LINE 707: BEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you
LINE 708: rotter! _(To the court.)_ Why, look at the man's private life! Leading
LINE 709: a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be
LINE 710: mentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!
LINE 711: BLOOM: _(To the court.)_ And he, a bachelor, how...
LINE 712: FIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.
LINE 713: THE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!
LINE 714: _(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket
LINE 715: on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)_
LINE 716: SECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?
LINE 717: MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable
LINE 718: character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation,
LINE 719: six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave
LINE 720: owing to his carryings on.
LINE 721: FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?
LINE 722: MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of
LINE 723: myself as poor as I am.
LINE 724: BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless
LINE 725: slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white. I
LINE 726: gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.
LINE 727: Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.
LINE 728: There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.
LINE 729: MARY DRISCOLL: _(Excitedly.)_ As God is looking down on me this night
LINE 730: if ever I laid a hand to them oylsters!
LINE 731: FIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?
LINE 732: MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your
LINE 733: honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for
LINE 734: a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a
LINE 735: result. And he interfered twict with my clothing.
LINE 736: BLOOM: She counterassaulted.
LINE 737: MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the
LINE 738: scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he
LINE 739: remarked: keep it quiet.
LINE 740: _(General laughter.)_
LINE 741: GEORGE FOTTRELL: _(Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.)_ Order in
LINE 742: court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.
LINE 743: _(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins
LINE 744: a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say
LINE 745: in his stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but,
LINE 746: though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to
LINE 747: reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and
LINE 748: return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths' child, he
LINE 749: had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.
LINE 750: There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn
LINE 751: over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping
LINE 752: post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by
LINE 753: the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An
LINE 754: acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate
LINE 755: of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain
LINE 756: refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
LINE 757: loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
LINE 758: rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one
LINE 759: and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to
LINE 760: the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or
LINE 761: model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour
LINE 762: reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the
LINE 763: boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what
LINE 764: times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with
LINE 765: four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain
LINE 766: ever...._
LINE 767: _(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that
LINE 768: they cannot hear.)_
LINE 769: LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: _(Without looking up from their notebooks.)_
LINE 770: Loosen his boots.
LINE 771: PROFESSOR MACHUGH: _(From the presstable, coughs and calls.)_ Cough it
LINE 772: up, man. Get it out in bits.
LINE 773: _(The crossexamination proceeds_ re _Bloom and the bucket. A large
LINE 774: bucket. Bloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes.
LINE 775: Quite bad. A plasterer's bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered
LINE 776: untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some
LINE 777: spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather
LINE 778: a mess. Not completely. A_ Titbits _back number_.)
LINE 779: _(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom in a torn frockcoat stained with
LINE 780: whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of
LINE 781: stickingplaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)_
LINE 782: J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with
LINE 783: a voice of pained protest.)_ This is no place for indecent levity at
LINE 784: the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a
LINE 785: beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My
LINE 786: client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a
LINE 787: stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up
LINE 788: misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on
LINE 789: by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence
LINE 790: being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the
LINE 791: Pharaoh. _Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at
LINE 792: carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of
LINE 793: by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would
LINE 794: deal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and
LINE 795: somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could
LINE 796: a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between
LINE 797: the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from
LINE 798: cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian
LINE 799: extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.
LINE 800: BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers,
LINE 801: apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about
LINE 802: him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches
LINE 803: his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes
LINE 804: the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.)_ Him makee velly muchee fine
LINE 805: night. _(He begins to lilt simply.)_
LINE 806: Li li poo lil chile
LINE 807: Blingee pigfoot evly night
LINE 808: Payee two shilly...
LINE 809: _(He is howled down.)_
LINE 810: J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(Hotly to the populace.)_ This is a lonehand fight. By
LINE 811: Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this
LINE 812: fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has
LINE 813: superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,
LINE 814: without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused
LINE 815: was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered
LINE 816: with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very
LINE 817: own daughter. _(Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his
LINE 818: lips.)_ I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that
LINE 819: the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute
LINE 820: Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the
LINE 821: world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object
LINE 822: to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some
LINE 823: dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will
LINE 824: on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I
LINE 825: know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his
LINE 826: extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of
LINE 827: which will now be shown. _(To Bloom.)_ I suggest that you will do the
LINE 828: handsome thing.
LINE 829: BLOOM: A penny in the pound.
LINE 830: _(The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in
LINE 831: silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino,
LINE 832: in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an
LINE 833: orange citron and a pork kidney.)_
LINE 834: DLUGACZ: _(Hoarsely.)_ Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.
LINE 835: _(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his
LINE 836: coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with
LINE 837: sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F.
LINE 838: Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the
LINE 839: galloping tide of rosepink blood.)_
LINE 840: J. J. O'MOLLOY: _(Almost voicelessly.)_ Excuse me. I am suffering from
LINE 841: a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen
LINE 842: words. _(He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal
LINE 843: eloquence of Seymour Bushe.)_ When the angel's book comes to be opened
LINE 844: if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and
LINE 845: of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the
LINE 846: bar the sacred benefit of the doubt.
LINE 847: _(A paper with something written on it is handed into court._)
LINE 848: BLOOM: _(In court dress.)_ Can give best references. Messrs Callan,
LINE 849: Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon,
LINE 850: ex lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the
LINE 851: highest... Queens of Dublin society. _(Carelessly.)_ I was just
LINE 852: chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir
LINE 853: Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I
LINE 854: said...
LINE 855: MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength
LINE 856: ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of
LINE 857: brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.)_ Arrest him, constable.
LINE 858: He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband
LINE 859: was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed
LINE 860: James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless
LINE 861: globes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command
LINE 862: performance of _La Cigale_. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made
LINE 863: improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on
LINE 864: the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the
LINE 865: post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl
LINE 866: with the Three Pairs of Stays_.
LINE 867: MRS BELLINGHAM: _(In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the nose,
LINE 868: steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell
LINE 869: quizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)_
LINE 870: Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because
LINE 871: he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day
LINE 872: during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the
LINE 873: wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently
LINE 874: he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in
LINE 875: my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the
LINE 876: information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant
LINE 877: purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.
LINE 878: MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!
LINE 879: _(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward.)_
LINE 880: THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: _(Screaming.)_ Stop thief! Hurrah there,
LINE 881: Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!
LINE 882: SECOND WATCH: _(Produces handcuffs.)_ Here are the darbies.
LINE 883: MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome
LINE 884: compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my
LINE 885: frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed
LINE 886: himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his
LINE 887: fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing
LINE 888: my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon
LINE 889: garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost
LINE 890: extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose
LINE 891: drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden
LINE 892: treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He
LINE 893: urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to
LINE 894: defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible
LINE 895: opportunity.
LINE 896: THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat,
LINE 897: jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets
LINE 898: with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she
LINE 899: strikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me. Because he saw me on the polo
LINE 900: ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of
LINE 901: Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger
LINE 902: Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob
LINE 903: _Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car
LINE 904: and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold
LINE 905: after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.
LINE 906: It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as
LINE 907: he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit
LINE 908: intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me
LINE 909: to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He
LINE 910: implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise
LINE 911: him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most
LINE 912: vicious horsewhipping.
LINE 913: MRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.
LINE 914: MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.
LINE 915: _(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters
LINE 916: received from Bloom.)_
LINE 917: THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Stamps her jingling spurs in a
LINE 918: sudden paroxysm of fury.)_ I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge
LINE 919: the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him
LINE 920: alive.
LINE 921: BLOOM: _(His eyes closing, quails expectantly.)_ Here? _(He squirms.)_
LINE 922: Again! _(He pants cringing.)_ I love the danger.
LINE 923: THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I'll make it hot for
LINE 924: you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.
LINE 925: MRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and
LINE 926: stripes on it!
LINE 927: MRS YELVERTON BARRY: Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married
LINE 928: man!
LINE 929: BLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm
LINE 930: tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the
LINE 931: circulation.
LINE 932: THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Laughs derisively.)_ O, did you,
LINE 933: my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of
LINE 934: your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever
LINE 935: bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into
LINE 936: fury.
LINE 937: MRS BELLINGHAM: _(Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)_
LINE 938: Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within
LINE 939: an inch of his life. The cat-o'-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.
LINE 940: BLOOM: _(Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien.)_ O
LINE 941: cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.
LINE 942: Let me off this once. _(He offers the other cheek.)_
LINE 943: MRS YELVERTON BARRY: _(Severely.)_ Don't do so on any account, Mrs
LINE 944: Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!
LINE 945: THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(Unbuttoning her gauntlet
LINE 946: violently.)_ I'll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since he
LINE 947: was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the
LINE 948: public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a
LINE 949: wellknown cuckold. _(She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air.)_
LINE 950: Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick!
LINE 951: Ready?
LINE 952: BLOOM: _(Trembling, beginning to obey.)_ The weather has been so warm.
LINE 953: _(Davy Stephens, ringletted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)_
LINE 954: DAVY STEPHENS: _Messenger of the Sacred Heart_ and _Evening Telegraph_
LINE 955: with Saint Patrick's Day supplement. Containing the new addresses of
LINE 956: all the cuckolds in Dublin.

LINE 958: exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend
LINE 959: John Hughes S. J. bend low.)_
LINE 960: THE TIMEPIECE: _(Unportalling.)_
LINE 961: Cuckoo.
LINE 962: Cuckoo.
LINE 963: Cuckoo.
LINE 964: _(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)_
LINE 965: THE QUOITS: Jigjag. Jigajiga. Jigjag.
LINE 966: _(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox
LINE 967: the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman, silkhatted, Jack Power, Simon
LINE 968: Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford,
LINE 969: Lenehan, Paddy Leonard, Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of
LINE 970: a Nameless One.)_
LINE 971: THE NAMELESS ONE: Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised
LINE 972: her.
LINE 973: THE JURORS: _(All their heads turned to his voice.)_ Really?
LINE 974: THE NAMELESS ONE: _(Snarls.)_ Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.
LINE 975: THE JURORS: _(All their heads lowered in assent.)_ Most of us thought
LINE 976: as much.
LINE 977: FIRST WATCH: He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack
LINE 978: the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.
LINE 979: SECOND WATCH: _(Awed, whispers.)_ And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.
LINE 980: THE CRIER: _(Loudly.)_ Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a
LINE 981: wellknown dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold and a public
LINE 982: nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of
LINE 983: assizes the most honourable...
LINE 984: _(His Honour, sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, in judicial
LINE 985: garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his
LINE 986: arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic
LINE 987: ramshorns.)_
LINE 988: THE RECORDER: I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid
LINE 989: Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! _(He dons the black cap.)_ Let
LINE 990: him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and
LINE 991: detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure
LINE 992: and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not
LINE 993: at your peril or may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Remove him. _(A
LINE 994: black skullcap descends upon his head.)_
LINE 995: _(The subsheriff Long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry
LINE 996: Clay.)_
LINE 997: LONG JOHN FANNING: _(Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.)_
LINE 998: Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?
LINE 999: _(H. Rumbold, master barber, in a bloodcoloured jerkin and tanner's
LINE 1000: apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder, mounts the block. A life
LINE 1001: preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs
LINE 1002: grimly his grappling hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)_
LINE 1003: RUMBOLD: _(To the recorder with sinister familiarity.)_ Hanging Harry,
LINE 1004: your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or
LINE 1005: nothing.
LINE 1006: _(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)_
LINE 1007: THE BELLS: Heigho! Heigho!
LINE 1008: BLOOM: _(Desperately.)_ Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw.
LINE 1009: Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzee.
LINE 1010: _(Breathlessly.)_ Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me.
LINE 1011: _(Overcome with emotion.)_ I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure
LINE 1012: in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That
LINE 1013: three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more...
LINE 1014: HYNES: _(Coldly.)_ You are a perfect stranger.
LINE 1015: SECOND WATCH: _(Points to the corner.)_ The bomb is here.
LINE 1016: FIRST WATCH: Infernal machine with a time fuse.
LINE 1017: BLOOM: No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral.
LINE 1018: FIRST WATCH: _(Draws his truncheon.)_ Liar!
LINE 1019: _(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy
LINE 1020: Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He

LINE 1022: mortuary habit. His green eye flashes bloodshot. Half of one ear, all
LINE 1023: the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)_
LINE 1024: PADDY DIGNAM: _(In a hollow voice.)_ It is true. It was my funeral.

LINE 1026: from natural causes.
LINE 1027: _(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)_
LINE 1028: BLOOM: _(In triumph.)_ You hear?
LINE 1029: PADDY DIGNAM: Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!
LINE 1030: BLOOM: The voice is the voice of Esau.
LINE 1031: SECOND WATCH: _(Blesses himself.)_ How is that possible?
LINE 1032: FIRST WATCH: It is not in the penny catechism.
LINE 1033: PADDY DIGNAM: By metempsychosis. Spooks.
LINE 1034: A VOICE: O rocks.
LINE 1035: PADDY DIGNAM: _(Earnestly.)_ Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H.
LINE 1036: Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27
LINE 1037: Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied.
LINE 1038: Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it?
LINE 1039: Keep her off that bottle of sherry. _(He looks round him.)_ A lamp. I
LINE 1040: must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.
LINE 1041: _(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker, stands forth, holding
LINE 1042: a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey,

LINE 1054: stiffpointed, his ears cocked.)_
LINE 1055: PADDY DIGNAM: Pray for the repose of his soul.
LINE 1056: _(He worms down through a coalhole, his brown habit trailing its tether
LINE 1057: over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on
LINE 1058: fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is

LINE 1063: find him. _(He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.)_ My turn now
LINE 1064: on. Follow me up to Carlow.
LINE 1065: _(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the
LINE 1066: coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble, eyes of nought. All recedes.
LINE 1067: Bloom plodges forward again through the sump. Kisses chirp amid the
LINE 1068: rifts of fog. A piano sounds. He stands before a lighted house,
LINE 1069: listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him,
LINE 1070: twittering, warbling, cooing.)_
LINE 1071: THE KISSES: _(Warbling.)_ Leo! _(Twittering.)_ Icky licky micky sticky
LINE 1072: for Leo! _(Cooing.)_ Coo coocoo! Yummyyum, Womwom! _(Warbling.)_ Big
LINE 1073: comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! _(Twittering.)_ Leeolee! _(Warbling.)_ O
LINE 1074: Leo!
LINE 1075: _(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddy flecks,
LINE 1076: silvery sequins.)_
LINE 1077: BLOOM: A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.
LINE 1078: _(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three
LINE 1079: bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods,
LINE 1080: trips down the steps and accosts him.)_
LINE 1081: ZOE: Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.
LINE 1082: BLOOM: Is this Mrs Mack's?
LINE 1083: ZOE: No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse.
LINE 1084: Mother Slipperslapper. _(Familiarly.)_ She's on the job herself tonight
LINE 1085: with the vet her tipster that gives her all the winners and pays for
LINE 1086: her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today.
LINE 1087: _(Suspiciously.)_ You're not his father, are you?
LINE 1088: BLOOM: Not I!
LINE 1089: ZOE: You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?
LINE 1090: _(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand glides over
LINE 1091: his left thigh.)_
LINE 1092: ZOE: How's the nuts?
LINE 1093: BLOOM: Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier, I suppose.
LINE 1094: One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.
LINE 1095: ZOE: _(In sudden alarm.)_ You've a hard chancre.
LINE 1096: BLOOM: Not likely.
LINE 1097: ZOE: I feel it.
LINE 1098: _(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard
LINE 1099: black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist
LINE 1100: lips.)_
LINE 1101: BLOOM: A talisman. Heirloom.
LINE 1102: ZOE: For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?
LINE 1103: _(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket then links his arm,
LINE 1104: cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by
LINE 1105: note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her
LINE 1106: eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)_
LINE 1107: ZOE: You'll know me the next time.
LINE 1108: BLOOM: _(Forlornly.)_ I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure
LINE 1109: to...
LINE 1110: _(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round
LINE 1111: their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong
LINE 1112: hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by
LINE 1113: the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white,
LINE 1114: still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth
LINE 1115: roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood
LINE 1116: exudes, strangely murmuring.)_
LINE 1117: ZOE: _(Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously
LINE 1118: smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach,

LINE 1120: BLOOM: _(Fascinated.)_ I thought you were of good stock by your accent.
LINE 1121: ZOE: And you know what thought did?
LINE 1122: _(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth, sending on
LINE 1123: him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a
LINE 1124: sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)_
LINE 1125: BLOOM: _(Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat
LINE 1126: awkward hand.)_ Are you a Dublin girl?
LINE 1127: ZOE: _(Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.)_ No
LINE 1128: bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?
LINE 1129: BLOOM: _(As before.)_ Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish
LINE 1130: device. _(Lewdly.)_ The mouth can be better engaged than with a
LINE 1131: cylinder of rank weed.
LINE 1132: ZOE: Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.
LINE 1133: BLOOM: _(In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating
LINE 1134: tie and apache cap.)_ Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Ralegh
LINE 1135: brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer
LINE 1136: of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye,
LINE 1137: heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say he brought the
LINE 1138: poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget
LINE 1139: brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our
LINE 1140: public life!
LINE 1141: _(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)_
LINE 1142: THE CHIMES: Turn again, Leopold! Lord mayor of Dublin!
LINE 1143: BLOOM: _(In alderman's gown and chain.)_ Electors of Arran Quay, Inns
LINE 1144: Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say,
LINE 1145: from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future.

LINE 1161: henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.
LINE 1162: COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK: Carried unanimously.
LINE 1163: BLOOM: _(Impassionedly.)_ These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as
LINE 1164: they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?
LINE 1165: Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving
LINE 1166: apparatuses, supplanters, bugbears, manufactured monsters for mutual
LINE 1167: murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts
LINE 1168: upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are

LINE 1175: sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the Royal
LINE 1176: Dublin Fusiliers, the King's own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron
LINE 1177: Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back
LINE 1178: the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts,
LINE 1179: telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings,
LINE 1180: rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A
LINE 1181: fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The
LINE 1182: beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and
LINE 1183: waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high,
LINE 1184: surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession
LINE 1185: appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard

LINE 1280: BLOOM: On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at
LINE 1281: Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with
LINE 1282: telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do
LINE 1283: we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the

LINE 1452: _(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by
LINE 1453: stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening
LINE 1454: their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from
LINE 1455: the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery,
LINE 1456: asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gasovens, hanging
LINE 1457: themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different
LINE 1458: storeys.)_
LINE 1459: ALEXANDER J DOWIE: _(Violently.)_ Fellowchristians and antiBloomites,
LINE 1460: the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian
LINE 1461: men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of
LINE 1462: Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the
LINE 1463: cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite,
LINE 1464: bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A
LINE 1465: worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his
LINE 1466: nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him.
LINE 1467: Caliban!
LINE 1468: THE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!
LINE 1469: _(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from
LINE 1470: upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial
LINE 1471: value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread,
LINE 1472: sheep's tails, odd pieces of fat.)_
LINE 1473: BLOOM: _(Excitedly.)_ This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke
LINE 1474: again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my
LINE 1475: brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn.
LINE 1476: Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, _sgenl
LINE 1477: inn ban bata coisde gan capall._ I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi
LINE 1478: Mulligan, sex specialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.
LINE 1479: DR MULLIGAN: _(In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow.)_ Dr
LINE 1480: Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's
LINE 1481: private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary
LINE 1482: epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of
LINE 1483: elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are
LINE 1484: marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent.
LINE 1485: He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in
LINE 1486: consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a
LINE 1487: family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to
LINE 1488: be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal
LINE 1489: examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,
LINE 1490: axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be _virgo
LINE 1491: intacta._
LINE 1492: _(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)_
LINE 1493: DR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming
LINE 1494: generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in
LINE 1495: spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.
LINE 1496: DR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid.
LINE 1497: Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.
LINE 1498: DR PUNCH COSTELLO: The _fetor judaicus_ is most perceptible.
LINE 1499: DR DIXON: _(Reads a bill of health.)_ Professor Bloom is a finished
LINE 1500: example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.
LINE 1501: Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint
LINE 1502: fellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.
LINE 1503: He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the
LINE 1504: court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which
LINE 1505: clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can
LINE 1506: affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food,
LINE 1507: cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish
LINE 1508: manufacture winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He
LINE 1509: was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree
LINE 1510: reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child.
LINE 1511: I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal
LINE 1512: organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.
LINE 1513: _(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American
LINE 1514: makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank
LINE 1515: cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange,
LINE 1516: I. O. U's, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets
LINE 1517: are rapidly collected.)_
LINE 1518: BLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.
LINE 1519: MRS THORNTON: _(In nursetender's gown.)_ Embrace me tight, dear. You'll
LINE 1520: be soon over it. Tight, dear.
LINE 1521: _(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white
LINE 1522: children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive
LINE 1523: plants. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces,
LINE 1524: wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern
LINE 1525: languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each
LINE 1526: has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro,

LINE 1636: of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the
LINE 1637: father and mother of a bating. _(With a tear in his eye.)_ All

LINE 1639: To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can
LINE 1640: live on. _(He gazes far away mournfully.)_ I am ruined. A few pastilles
LINE 1641: of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. _(He
LINE 1642: breathes softly.)_ No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.
LINE 1643: ZOE: _(Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.)_ Honest? Till the next

LINE 1645: came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts!
LINE 1646: BLOOM: _(Bitterly.)_ Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and
LINE 1647: bottle. I'm sick of it. Let everything rip.
LINE 1648: ZOE: _(In sudden sulks.)_ I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a
LINE 1649: bleeding whore a chance.
LINE 1650: BLOOM: _(Repentantly.)_ I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary
LINE 1651: evil. Where are you from? London?
LINE 1652: ZOE: _(Glibly.)_ Hog's Norton where the pigs plays the organs. I'm
LINE 1653: Yorkshire born. _(She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.)_
LINE 1654: I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for
LINE 1655: a short time? Ten shillings?
LINE 1656: BLOOM: _(Smiles, nods slowly.)_ More, houri, more.
LINE 1657: ZOE: And more's mother? _(She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.)_
LINE 1658: Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll
LINE 1659: peel off.
LINE 1660: BLOOM: _(Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled
LINE 1661: embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled
LINE 1662: pears.)_ Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The
LINE 1663: greeneyed monster. _(Earnestly.)_ You know how difficult it is. I
LINE 1664: needn't tell you.
LINE 1665: ZOE: _(Flattered.)_ What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for.
LINE 1666: _(She pats him.)_ Come.
LINE 1667: BLOOM: Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.
LINE 1668: ZOE: Babby!
LINE 1669: BLOOM: _(In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair,
LINE 1670: fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a
LINE 1671: chubby finger, his moist tongue lolling and lisping.)_ One two tlee:
LINE 1672: tlee tlwo tlone.
LINE 1673: THE BUCKLES: Love me. Love me not. Love me.
LINE 1674: ZOE: Silent means consent. _(With little parted talons she captures his
LINE 1675: hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret
LINE 1676: monitor, luring him to doom.)_ Hot hands cold gizzard.
LINE 1677: _(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards
LINE 1678: the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her
LINE 1679: painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the
LINE 1680: lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)_
LINE 1681: THE MALE BRUTES: _(Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in
LINE 1682: their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and
LINE 1683: fro.)_ Good!
LINE 1684: _(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.
LINE 1685: They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile
LINE 1686: to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)_
LINE 1687: ZOE: _(Her lucky hand instantly saving him.)_ Hoopsa! Don't fall
LINE 1688: upstairs.
LINE 1689: BLOOM: The just man falls seven times. _(He stands aside at the
LINE 1690: threshold.)_ After you is good manners.
LINE 1691: ZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.
LINE 1692: _(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out
LINE 1693: her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall
LINE 1694: hang a man's hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing
LINE 1695: them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is
LINE 1696: flung open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked,
LINE 1697: passes with an ape's gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld,
LINE 1698: hugging a full waterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at
LINE 1699: heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the
LINE 1700: halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head
LINE 1701: sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper
LINE 1702: dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies,
LINE 1703: colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of
LINE 1704: jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in
LINE 1705: all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a
LINE 1706: morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage
LINE 1707: higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapestried with a paper of yewfronds
LINE 1708: and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers.
LINE 1709: Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back
LINE 1710: to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony
LINE 1711: pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral
LINE 1712: wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the
LINE 1713: table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over
LINE 1714: the mantelpiece. A tag of her corsetlace hangs slightly below her
LINE 1715: jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)_
LINE 1716: KITTY: _(Coughs behind her hand.)_ She's a bit imbecillic. _(She signs
LINE 1717: with a waggling forefinger.)_ Blemblem. _(Lynch lifts up her skirt and
LINE 1718: white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.)_ Respect
LINE 1719: yourself. _(She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which
LINE 1720: her hair glows, red with henna.)_ O, excuse!
LINE 1721: ZOE: More limelight, Charley. _(She goes to the chandelier and turns
LINE 1722: the gas full cock.)_
LINE 1723: KITTY: _(Peers at the gasjet.)_ What ails it tonight?
LINE 1724: LYNCH: _(Deeply.)_ Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.
LINE 1725: ZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.
LINE 1726: _(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at
LINE 1727: the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he
LINE 1728: repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond
LINE 1729: feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry,
LINE 1730: lolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the
LINE 1731: bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)_
LINE 1732: KITTY: _(Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.)_ O, excuse!
LINE 1733: ZOE: _(Promptly.)_ Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your
LINE 1734: shift.
LINE 1735: _(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over
LINE 1736: her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled
LINE 1737: catterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen
LINE 1738: glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)_
LINE 1739: STEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto
LINE 1740: Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an
LINE 1741: old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate _Cœla enarrant gloriam Domini._
LINE 1742: It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and
LINE 1743: mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round
LINE 1744: David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's
LINE 1745: tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of
LINE 1746: his almightiness. _Mais nom de nom,_ that is another pair of trousers.
LINE 1747: _Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at
LINE 1748: Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.)_ Which side is your knowledge bump?
LINE 1749: THE CAP: _(With saturnine spleen.)_ Bah! It is because it is. Woman's
LINE 1750: reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form
LINE 1751: of life. Bah!
LINE 1752: STEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts,
LINE 1753: mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty?
LINE 1754: Whetstone!
LINE 1755: THE CAP: Bah!
LINE 1756: STEPHEN: Here's another for you. _(He frowns.)_ The reason is because
LINE 1757: the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible
LINE 1758: interval which...
LINE 1759: THE CAP: Which? Finish. You can't.
LINE 1760: STEPHEN: _(With an effort.)_ Interval which. Is the greatest possible
LINE 1761: ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.
LINE 1762: THE CAP: Which?
LINE 1763: _(Outside the gramophone begins to blare_ The Holy City.)
LINE 1764: STEPHEN: _(Abruptly.)_ What went forth to the ends of the world to
LINE 1765: traverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,
LINE 1766: having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a
LINE 1767: moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self
LINE 1768: which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. _Ecco!_
LINE 1769: LYNCH: _(With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe
LINE 1770: Higgins.)_ What a learned speech, eh?
LINE 1771: ZOE: _(Briskly.)_ God help your head, he knows more than you have
LINE 1772: forgotten.
LINE 1773: _(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)_
LINE 1774: FLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.
LINE 1775: KITTY: No!
LINE 1776: ZOE: _(Explodes in laughter.)_ Great unjust God!
LINE 1777: FLORRY: _(Offended.)_ Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O,
LINE 1778: my foot's tickling.
LINE 1779: _(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past,
LINE 1780: yelling.)_
LINE 1781: THE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea
LINE 1782: serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.
LINE 1783: _(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)_
LINE 1784: STEPHEN: A time, times and half a time.
LINE 1785: _(Reuben J Antichrist, wandering jew, a clutching hand open on his
LINE 1786: spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrim's wallet
LINE 1787: from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over
LINE 1788: his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden
LINE 1789: huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the
LINE 1790: slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello,
LINE 1791: hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead
LINE 1792: and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering
LINE 1793: darkness.)_
LINE 1794: ALL: What?
LINE 1795: THE HOBGOBLIN: _(His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his
LINE 1796: eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping with outstretched clutching arms, then
LINE 1797: all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.)
LINE 1798: Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigène! (He whirls

LINE 1832: Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ,
LINE 1833: Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold
LINE 1834: feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism.
LINE 1835: You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders
LINE 1836: with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I
LINE 1837: say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to
LINE 1838: heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure.
LINE 1839: The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just

LINE 1850: ELIJAH: _(In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the
LINE 1851: top of his voice, his arms uplifted.)_ Big Brother up there, Mr
LINE 1852: President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I

LINE 1858: at his audience.)_ Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he aint
LINE 1859: saying nothing.
LINE 1860: KITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I
LINE 1861: did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in
LINE 1862: the brown scapular. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a
LINE 1863: working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.
LINE 1864: ZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.
LINE 1865: FLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of
LINE 1866: Hennessy's three star. I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into
LINE 1867: the bed.
LINE 1868: STEPHEN: In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without

LINE 1881: hat.)_
LINE 1882: BEST: _(Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the
LINE 1883: crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.)_
LINE 1884: I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't
LINE 1885: you know, Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says.
LINE 1886: JOHN EGLINTON: _(Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it
LINE 1887: towards a corner: with carping accent.)_ Esthetics and cosmetics are

LINE 1890: _(In the cone of the searchlight behind the coalscuttle, ollave,

LINE 1893: head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His
LINE 1894: right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish
LINE 1895: by its two talons.)_
LINE 1896: MANANAUN MACLIR: _(With a voice of waves.)_ Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub!
LINE 1897: Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the gods. Occult pimander of Hermes
LINE 1898: Trismegistos. _(With a voice of whistling seawind.)_ Punarjanam

LINE 1901: Shakti Shiva, darkhidden Father! _(He smites with his bicycle pump the
LINE 1902: crayfish in his left hand. On its cooperative dial glow the twelve
LINE 1903: signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.)_ Aum!
LINE 1904: Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead! I am the dreamery
LINE 1905: creamery butter.
LINE 1906: _(A skeleton judashand strangles the light. The green light wanes to

LINE 1908: THE GASJET: Pooah! Pfuiiiiiii!
LINE 1909: _(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the
LINE 1910: mantle.)_
LINE 1911: ZOE: Who has a fag as I'm here?
LINE 1912: LYNCH: _(Tossing a cigarette on to the table.)_ Here.
LINE 1913: ZOE: _(Her head perched aside in mock pride.)_ Is that the way to hand
LINE 1914: the _pot_ to a lady? _(She stretches up to light the cigarette over the
LINE 1915: flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits.
LINE 1916: Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her
LINE 1917: garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She
LINE 1918: puffs calmly at her cigarette.)_ Can you see the beautyspot of my
LINE 1919: behind?
LINE 1920: LYNCH: I'm not looking.
LINE 1921: ZOE: _(Makes sheep's eyes.)_ No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would
LINE 1922: you suck a lemon?
LINE 1923: _(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom,
LINE 1924: then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue
LINE 1925: fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously,
LINE 1926: twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her
LINE 1927: spittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag,
LINE 1928: basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and
LINE 1929: struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into
LINE 1930: several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a
LINE 1931: roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle
LINE 1932: O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an
LINE 1933: Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)_
LINE 1934: VIRAG: _(Heels together, bows.)_ My name is Virag Lipoti, of
LINE 1935: Szombathely. _(He coughs thoughtfully, drily.)_ Promiscuous nakedness
LINE 1936: is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed
LINE 1937: the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of
LINE 1938: which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I
LINE 1939: hope you perceived? Good.
LINE 1940: BLOOM: Granpapachi. But...
LINE 1941: VIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and
LINE 1942: coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of
LINE 1943: gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I
LINE 1944: should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always
LINE 1945: understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses
LINE 1946: of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity.
LINE 1947: In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?
LINE 1948: BLOOM: She is rather lean.
LINE 1949: VIRAG: _(Not unpleasantly.)_ Absolutely! Well observed and those
LINE 1950: pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to
LINE 1951: suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for
LINE 1952: which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye.
LINE 1953: Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you
LINE 1954: tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! _(With a nervous twitch of
LINE 1955: his head.)_ Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!
LINE 1956: BLOOM: _(An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.)_
LINE 1957: She seems sad.
LINE 1958: VIRAG: _(Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left
LINE 1959: eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.)_ Hoax! Beware of the flapper and
LINE 1960: bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button
LINE 1961: discovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon.
LINE 1962: _(More genially.)_ Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item
LINE 1963: number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe
LINE 1964: the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she
LINE 1965: bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.
LINE 1966: BLOOM: _(Regretfully.)_ When you come out without your gun.
LINE 1967: VIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your
LINE 1968: money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...
LINE 1969: BLOOM: With...?
LINE 1970: VIRAG: _(His tongue upcurling.)_ Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is
LINE 1971: coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in
LINE 1972: weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two
LINE 1973: protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the
LINE 1974: noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional
LINE 1975: protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,
LINE 1976: which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts
LINE 1977: are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers
LINE 1978: reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and
LINE 1979: gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during
LINE 1980: their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal
LINE 1981: blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker
LINE 1982: after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. _(His throat twitches.)_ Slapbang!
LINE 1983: There he goes again.
LINE 1984: BLOOM: The stye I dislike.
LINE 1985: VIRAG: _(Arches his eyebrows.)_ Contact with a goldring, they say.
LINE 1986: _Argumentum ad feminam_, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in
LINE 1987: the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve's
LINE 1988: sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. _(He twitches.)_
LINE 1989: It is a funny sound. _(He coughs encouragingly.)_ But possibly it is
LINE 1990: only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have
LINE 1991: taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.
LINE 1992: BLOOM: _(Reflecting.)_ Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This
LINE 1993: searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of
LINE 1994: accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...
LINE 1995: VIRAG: _(Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.)_ Stop
LINE 1996: twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have
LINE 1997: forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. _La causa è santa_. Tara. Tara.
LINE 1998: _(Aside.)_ He will surely remember.
LINE 1999: BLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over
LINE 2000: parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a
LINE 2001: deadhand cures. Mnemo?
LINE 2002: VIRAG: _(Excitedly.)_ I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. _(He taps
LINE 2003: his parchmentroll energetically.)_ This book tells you how to act with
LINE 2004: all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of
LINE 2005: aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to
LINE 2006: talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved.
LINE 2007: Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue
LINE 2008: to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you
LINE 2009: like or dislike women in male habiliments? _(With a dry snigger.)_ You
LINE 2010: intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem
LINE 2011: and the summer months of 1886 to square the circle and win that
LINE 2012: million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.
LINE 2013: Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or,
LINE 2014: put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? _(He
LINE 2015: crows derisively.)_ Keekeereekee!
LINE 2016: _(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled
LINE 2017: mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)_
LINE 2018: BLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence
LINE 2019: this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is
LINE 2020: will then morrow as now was be past yester.
LINE 2021: VIRAG: _(Prompts in a pig's whisper.)_ Insects of the day spend their
LINE 2022: brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the
LINE 2023: inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal nerve
LINE 2024: in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! _(His yellow parrotbeak gabbles
LINE 2025: nasally.)_ They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year
LINE 2026: five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of
LINE 2027: honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first
LINE 2028: choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At
LINE 2029: another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. _(He
LINE 2030: coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a
LINE 2031: scooping hand.)_ You shall find that these night insects follow the
LINE 2032: light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all
LINE 2033: these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of
LINE 2034: Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book
LINE 2035: sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose
LINE 2036: movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun.
LINE 2037: Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! _(He blows into
LINE 2038: Bloom's ear.)_ Buzz!
LINE 2039: BLOOM: Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed
LINE 2040: self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...
LINE 2041: VIRAG: _(His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.)_ Splendid!
LINE 2042: Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. _(He gobbles
LINE 2043: gluttonously with turkey wattles.)_ Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are
LINE 2044: we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! _(He unrolls his parchment rapidly and
LINE 2045: reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he
LINE 2046: claws.)_ Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters
LINE 2047: will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves
LINE 2048: may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through
LINE 2049: mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility
LINE 2050: or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. _(He wags his head with
LINE 2051: cackling raillery.)_ Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. _(He
LINE 2052: sneezes.)_ Amen!
LINE 2053: BLOOM: _(Absently.)_ Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always
LINE 2054: open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet
LINE 2055: Eve and the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy
LINE 2056: to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way
LINE 2057: through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry.
LINE 2058: Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.
LINE 2059: VIRAG: _(His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly
LINE 2060: closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.)_ That the cows with their those
LINE 2061: distended udders that they have been the the known...
LINE 2062: BLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. _(He repeats.)_
LINE 2063: Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their
LINE 2064: teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. _(Profoundly.)_ Instinct
LINE 2065: rules the world. In life. In death.
LINE 2066: VIRAG: _(Head askew, arches his back and hunched wingshoulders, peers
LINE 2067: at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a horning claw and
LINE 2068: cries.)_ Who's moth moth? Who's dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O
LINE 2069: dear, he is Gerald. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will

LINE 2072: sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.)_
LINE 2073: Well, well. He doth rest anon. (He snaps his jaws suddenly on the air.)
LINE 2074: THE MOTH:
LINE 2075: I'm a tiny tiny thing
LINE 2076: Ever flying in the spring
LINE 2077: Round and round a ringaring.
LINE 2078: Long ago I was a king
LINE 2079: Now I do this kind of thing
LINE 2080: On the wing, on the wing!
LINE 2081: Bing!
LINE 2082: _(He rushes against the mauve shade, flapping noisily.)_ Pretty pretty
LINE 2083: pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.
LINE 2084: _(From left upper entrance with two gliding steps Henry Flower comes
LINE 2085: forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping
LINE 2086: plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a
LINE 2087: longstemmed bamboo Jacob's pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female
LINE 2088: head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the
LINE 2089: romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache.
LINE 2090: His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince

LINE 2094: There is a flower that bloometh.

LINE 2097: piano.)_
LINE 2098: STEPHEN: _(To himself.)_ Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling

LINE 2104: comes now. Yes. Not much however.

LINE 2107: ARTIFONI: _Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto._
LINE 2108: FLORRY: Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.
LINE 2109: STEPHEN: No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you
LINE 2110: the letter about the lute?
LINE 2111: FLORRY: _(Smirking.)_ The bird that can sing and won't sing.
LINE 2112: _(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober, two Oxford dons
LINE 2113: with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with
LINE 2114: Matthew Arnold's face.)_
LINE 2115: PHILIP SOBER: Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with
LINE 2116: the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve
LINE 2117: you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew.

LINE 2120: PHILIP DRUNK: _(Impatiently.)_ Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my
LINE 2121: way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of

LINE 2124: When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere. Mac Somebody.

LINE 2126: FLORRY: And the song?
LINE 2127: STEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
LINE 2128: FLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.
LINE 2129: STEPHEN: Out of it now. _(To himself.)_ Clever.
LINE 2130: PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER: _(Their lawnmowers purring with a
LINE 2131: rigadoon of grasshalms.)_ Clever ever. Out of it out of it. By the bye

LINE 2134: ZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of

LINE 2137: VIRAG: Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. _(Harshly,
LINE 2138: his pupils waxing.)_ To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun.
LINE 2139: I am the Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why
LINE 2140: I left the church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the
LINE 2141: Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. _(He wriggles.)_ Woman,
LINE 2142: undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni
LINE 2143: to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of
LINE 2144: jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man
LINE 2145: loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. _(He cries.)
LINE 2146: Coactus volui._ Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grapses
LINE 2147: woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry,
LINE 2148: strikes woman's fat yadgana. _(He chases his tail.)_ Piffpaff! Popo!
LINE 2149: _(He stops, sneezes.)_ Pchp! _(He worries his butt.)_ Prrrrrht!
LINE 2150: LYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for
LINE 2151: shooting a bishop.
LINE 2152: ZOE: _(Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.)_ He couldn't get a
LINE 2153: connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.
LINE 2154: BLOOM: Poor man!
LINE 2155: ZOE: _(Lightly.)_ Only for what happened him.
LINE 2156: BLOOM: How?
LINE 2157: VIRAG: _(A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,
LINE 2158: cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.)
LINE 2159: Verfluchte Goim!_ He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig
LINE 2160: God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the
LINE 2161: pope's bastard. _(He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid,
LINE 2162: his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute
LINE 2163: world.)_ A son of a whore. Apocalypse.
LINE 2164: KITTY: And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from
LINE 2165: Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't
LINE 2166: swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we
LINE 2167: all subscribed for the funeral.
LINE 2168: PHILIP DRUNK: _(Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position,

LINE 2170: PHILIP SOBER: _(Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe._
LINE 2171: _(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair.
LINE 2172: And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a
LINE 2173: whore's shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)_
LINE 2174: LYNCH: _(Laughs.)_ And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated
LINE 2175: anthropoid apes.
LINE 2176: FLORRY: _(Nods.)_ Locomotor ataxy.
LINE 2177: ZOE: _(Gaily.)_ O, my dictionary.
LINE 2178: LYNCH: Three wise virgins.
LINE 2179: VIRAG: _(Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony
LINE 2180: epileptic lips.)_ She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower.
LINE 2181: Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. _(He
LINE 2182: sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his
LINE 2183: fork.)_ Messiah! He burst her tympanum. _(With gibbering baboon's cries
LINE 2184: he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.)_ Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok!
LINE 2185: Kuk!
LINE 2186: _(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled,

LINE 2189: bagslops.)_
LINE 2190: BEN DOLLARD: _(Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels
LINE 2191: jovially in base barreltone.)_ When love absorbs my ardent soul.
LINE 2192: _(The virgins Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley burst through the
LINE 2193: ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)_
LINE 2194: THE VIRGINS: _(Gushingly.)_ Big Ben! Ben my Chree!
LINE 2195: A VOICE: Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.
LINE 2196: BEN DOLLARD: _(Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.)_ Hold him now.
LINE 2197: HENRY: _(Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.)_
LINE 2198: Thine heart, mine love. _(He plucks his lutestrings.)_ When first I
LINE 2199: saw...
LINE 2200: VIRAG: _(Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.)_
LINE 2201: Rats! _(He yawns, showing a coalblack throat, and closes his jaws by an
LINE 2202: upward push of his parchmentroll.)_ After having said which I took my
LINE 2203: departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. _Dreck!_
LINE 2204: _(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb
LINE 2205: and gives a cow's lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to

LINE 2207: ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the
LINE 2208: wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)_
LINE 2209: THE FLYBILL: K. 11. Post No Bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.
LINE 2210: HENRY: All is lost now.

LINE 2212: VIRAG'S HEAD: Quack!
LINE 2213: _(Exeunt severally.)_
LINE 2214: STEPHEN: _(Over his shoulder to Zoe.)_ You would have preferred the
LINE 2215: fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware
LINE 2216: Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The
LINE 2217: agony in the closet.
LINE 2218: LYNCH: All one and the same God to her.
LINE 2219: STEPHEN: _(Devoutly.)_ And sovereign Lord of all things.
LINE 2220: FLORRY: _(To Stephen.)_ I'm sure you're a spoiled priest. Or a monk.
LINE 2221: LYNCH: He is. A cardinal's son.
LINE 2222: STEPHEN: Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.
LINE 2223: _(His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,
LINE 2224: appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks.
LINE 2225: Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his
LINE 2226: train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his
LINE 2227: head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread.
LINE 2228: Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a
LINE 2229: corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high
LINE 2230: with large wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:)_
LINE 2231: THE CARDINAL:
LINE 2232: Conservio lies captured
LINE 2233: He lies in the lowest dungeon
LINE 2234: With manacles and chains around his limbs

LINE 2236: _(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left
LINE 2237: cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to
LINE 2238: and fro, arms akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour:)_
LINE 2239: O, the poor little fellow
LINE 2240: Hihihihihis legs they were yellow
LINE 2241: He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake
LINE 2242: But some bloody savage
LINE 2243: To graize his white cabbage
LINE 2244: He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.
LINE 2245: _(A multitude of midges swarms white over his robe. He scratches
LINE 2246: himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims:)_
LINE 2247: I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to
LINE 2248: Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd
LINE 2249: walk me off the face of the bloody globe.
LINE 2250: _(His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers,
LINE 2251: imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his
LINE 2252: hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his
LINE 2253: trainbearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling,
LINE 2254: Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar,
LINE 2255: merciful male, melodious:)_
LINE 2256: Shall carry my heart to thee,
LINE 2257: Shall carry my heart to thee,
LINE 2258: And the breath of the balmy night
LINE 2259: Shall carry my heart to thee!

LINE 2261: THE DOORHANDLE: Theeee!
LINE 2262: ZOE: The devil is in that door.
LINE 2263: _(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking
LINE 2264: the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward
LINE 2265: involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the
LINE 2266: chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)_
LINE 2267: ZOE: _(Sniffs his hair briskly.)_ Hmmm! Thank your mother for the
LINE 2268: rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.
LINE 2269: BLOOM: _(Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,
LINE 2270: pricks his ears.)_ If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double
LINE 2271: event?
LINE 2272: ZOE: _(Tears open the silverfoil.)_ Fingers was made before forks.
LINE 2273: _(She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts
LINE 2274: and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.)_ No objection to French lozenges?
LINE 2275: _(He nods. She taunts him.)_ Have it now or wait till you get it? _(He
LINE 2276: opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle.
LINE 2277: His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.)_
LINE 2278: Catch!
LINE 2279: _(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it
LINE 2280: through with a crack.)_
LINE 2281: KITTY: _(Chewing.)_ The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have
LINE 2282: lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with
LINE 2283: his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.
LINE 2284: BLOOM: _(In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic
LINE 2285: forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance
LINE 2286: towards the door. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift
LINE 2287: pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing
LINE 2288: his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.)_ Go, go, go, I conjure
LINE 2289: you, whoever you are!
LINE 2290: _(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.
LINE 2291: Bloom's features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing
LINE 2292: calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)_
LINE 2293: BLOOM: _(Solemnly.)_ Thanks.
LINE 2294: ZOE: Do as you're bid. Here!
LINE 2295: _(A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)_
LINE 2296: BLOOM: _(Takes the chocolate.)_ Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But
LINE 2297: I bought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory.
LINE 2298: Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have.
LINE 2299: This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. _(He eats.)_
LINE 2300: Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new.
LINE 2301: Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at
LINE 2302: Andrews.
LINE 2303: _(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters. She is
LINE 2304: dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with
LINE 2305: tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like
LINE 2306: Minnie Hauck in_ Carmen. _On her left hand are wedding and keeper
LINE 2307: rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her
LINE 2308: olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted
LINE 2309: nostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)_
LINE 2310: BELLA: My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.
LINE 2311: _(She glances round her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom
LINE 2312: with hard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated
LINE 2313: faceneck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)_
LINE 2314: THE FAN: _(Flirting quickly, then slowly.)_ Married, I see.
LINE 2315: BLOOM: Yes. Partly, I have mislaid...
LINE 2316: THE FAN: _(Half opening, then closing.)_ And the missus is master.
LINE 2317: Petticoat government.
LINE 2318: BLOOM: _(Looks down with a sheepish grin.)_ That is so.
LINE 2319: THE FAN: _(Folding together, rests against her left eardrop.)_ Have you
LINE 2320: forgotten me?
LINE 2321: BLOOM: Nes. Yo.
LINE 2322: THE FAN: _(Folded akimbo against her waist.)_ Is me her was you dreamed
LINE 2323: before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same
LINE 2324: now we?
LINE 2325: _(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)_
LINE 2326: BLOOM: _(Wincing.)_ Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which
LINE 2327: women love.
LINE 2328: THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ We have met. You are mine. It is fate.
LINE 2329: BLOOM: _(Cowed.)_ Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your
LINE 2330: domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to
LINE 2331: speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before
LINE 2332: the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and
LINE 2333: window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per
LINE 2334: second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant
LINE 2335: a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family.
LINE 2336: Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed
LINE 2337: in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the
LINE 2338: end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with
LINE 2339: Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle as you probably... _(He
LINE 2340: winces.)_ Ah!
LINE 2341: RICHIE GOULDING: _(Bagweighted, passes the door.)_ Mocking is catch.
LINE 2342: Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's. Liver and kidney.
LINE 2343: THE FAN: _(Tapping.)_ All things end. Be mine. Now.
LINE 2344: BLOOM: _(Undecided.)_ All now? I should not have parted with my
LINE 2345: talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my
LINE 2346: time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.
LINE 2347: THE FAN: _(Points downwards slowly.)_ You may.
LINE 2348: BLOOM: _(Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.)_ We
LINE 2349: are observed.
LINE 2350: THE FAN: _(Points downwards quickly.)_ You must.
LINE 2351: BLOOM: _(With desire, with reluctance.)_ I can make a true black knot.
LINE 2352: Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for
LINE 2353: Kellett's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In
LINE 2354: courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!
LINE 2355: _(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the
LINE 2356: edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.
LINE 2357: Bloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers
LINE 2358: draws out and in her laces.)_
LINE 2359: BLOOM: _(Murmurs lovingly.)_ To be a shoefitter in Manfield's was my
LINE 2360: love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up
LINE 2361: crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so
LINE 2362: incredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model
LINE 2363: Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb
LINE 2364: toe, as worn in Paris.
LINE 2365: THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.
LINE 2366: BLOOM: _(Crosslacing.)_ Too tight?
LINE 2367: THE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.
LINE 2368: BLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar
LINE 2369: dance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned.
LINE 2370: That night she met... Now!
LINE 2371: _(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises
LINE 2372: his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow
LINE 2373: dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)_
LINE 2374: BLOOM: _(Mumbles.)_ Awaiting your further orders we remain,
LINE 2375: gentlemen,...
LINE 2376: BELLO: _(With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.)_ Hound of
LINE 2377: dishonour!
LINE 2378: BLOOM: _(Infatuated.)_ Empress!
LINE 2379: BELLO: _(His heavy cheekchops sagging.)_ Adorer of the adulterous rump!
LINE 2380: BLOOM: _(Plaintively.)_ Hugeness!
LINE 2381: BELLO: Dungdevourer!
LINE 2382: BLOOM: _(With sinews semiflexed.)_ Magmagnificence!
LINE 2383: BELLO: Down! _(He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.)_ Incline feet
LINE 2384: forward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling.
LINE 2385: On the hands down!
LINE 2386: BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)_
LINE 2387: Truffles!
LINE 2388: _(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,
LINE 2389: snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes
LINE 2390: shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of
LINE 2391: most excellent master.)_
LINE 2392: BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his
LINE 2393: shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat,
LINE 2394: sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock's feather, his hands stuck
LINE 2395: deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it
LINE 2396: in.)_ Footstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the
LINE 2397: throne of your despot's glorious heels so glistening in their proud
LINE 2398: erectness.
LINE 2399: BLOOM: _(Enthralled, bleats.)_ I promise never to disobey.
LINE 2400: BELLO: _(Laughs loudly.)_ Holy smoke! You little know what's in store
LINE 2401: for you. I'm the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in!
LINE 2402: I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son.
LINE 2403: Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel
LINE 2404: discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.
LINE 2405: _(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)_
LINE 2406: ZOE: _(Widening her slip to screen her.)_ She's not here.
LINE 2407: BLOOM: _(Closing her eyes.)_ She's not here.
LINE 2408: FLORRY: _(Hiding her with her gown.)_ She didn't mean it, Mr Bello.
LINE 2409: She'll be good, sir.
LINE 2410: KITTY: Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.
LINE 2411: BELLO: _(Coaxingly.)_ Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you,
LINE 2412: darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart
LINE 2413: talk, sweety. _(Bloom puts out her timid head.)_ There's a good girly
LINE 2414: now. _(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.)_ I only
LINE 2415: want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that
LINE 2416: tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.
LINE 2417: BLOOM: _(Fainting.)_ Don't tear my...
LINE 2418: BELLO: _(Savagely.)_ The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the
LINE 2419: hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like
LINE 2420: the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time! I'll make you
LINE 2421: remember me for the balance of your natural life. _(His forehead veins
LINE 2422: swollen, his face congested.)_ I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback
LINE 2423: every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat
LINE 2424: hamrashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. _(He belches.)_ And suck
LINE 2425: my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the _Licensed
LINE 2426: Victualler's Gazette_. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and
LINE 2427: skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling
LINE 2428: from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and
LINE 2429: lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you. _(He twists her arm. Bloom
LINE 2430: squeals, turning turtle.)_
LINE 2431: BLOOM: Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!
LINE 2432: BELLO: _(Twisting.)_ Another!
LINE 2433: BLOOM: _(Screams.)_ O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches
LINE 2434: like mad!
LINE 2435: BELLO: _(Shouts.)_ Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the
LINE 2436: best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting,
LINE 2437: damn you! _(He slaps her face.)_
LINE 2438: BLOOM: _(Whimpers.)_ You're after hitting me. I'll tell...
LINE 2439: BELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.
LINE 2440: ZOE: Yes. Walk on him! I will.
LINE 2441: FLORRY: I will. Don't be greedy.
LINE 2442: KITTY: No, me. Lend him to me.
LINE 2443: _(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,
LINE 2444: men's grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin
LINE 2445: stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the
LINE 2446: door.)_
LINE 2447: MRS KEOGH: _(Ferociously.)_ Can I help? _(They hold and pinion Bloom.)_
LINE 2448: BELLO: _(Squats with a grunt on Bloom's upturned face, puffing
LINE 2449: cigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg.)_ I see Keating Clay is elected
LINE 2450: vicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness's preference
LINE 2451: shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that didn't
LINE 2452: buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck,
LINE 2453: curse it. And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.
LINE 2454: _(He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.)_ Where's that
LINE 2455: Goddamned cursed ashtray?
LINE 2456: BLOOM: _(Goaded, buttocksmothered.)_ O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!
LINE 2457: BELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never
LINE 2458: prayed before. _(He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.)_ Here,
LINE 2459: kiss that. Both. Kiss. _(He throws a leg astride and, pressing with
LINE 2460: horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.)_ Gee up! A cockhorse to
LINE 2461: Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. _(He bends
LINE 2462: sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.)_ Ho!
LINE 2463: Off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. _(He horserides
LINE 2464: cockhorse, leaping in the, in the saddle.)_ The lady goes a pace a pace
LINE 2465: and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a
LINE 2466: gallop a gallop a gallop.
LINE 2467: FLORRY: _(Pulls at Bello.)_ Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked
LINE 2468: before you.
LINE 2469: ZOE: _(Pulling at Florry.)_ Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet,
LINE 2470: suckeress?
LINE 2471: BLOOM: _(Stifling.)_ Can't.
LINE 2472: BELLO: Well, I'm not. Wait. _(He holds in his breath.)_ Curse it. Here.
LINE 2473: This bung's about burst. _(He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting
LINE 2474: his features, farts loudly.)_ Take that! _(He recorks himself.)_ Yes,
LINE 2475: by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.
LINE 2476: BLOOM: _(A sweat breaking out over him.)_ Not man. _(He sniffs.)_
LINE 2477: Woman.
LINE 2478: BELLO: _(Stands up.)_ No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for
LINE 2479: has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a
LINE 2480: thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your
LINE 2481: male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk
LINE 2482: luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!
LINE 2483: BLOOM: _(Shrinks.)_ Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I
LINE 2484: tiptouch it with my nails?
LINE 2485: BELLO: _(Points to his whores.)_ As they are now so will you be,
LINE 2486: wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven
LINE 2487: armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be
LINE 2488: laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with
LINE 2489: whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge,
LINE 2490: while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in
LINE 2491: nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things
LINE 2492: stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for
LINE 2493: Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha
LINE 2494: and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing
LINE 2495: but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind
LINE 2496: you...
LINE 2497: BLOOM: _(A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large
LINE 2498: male hands and nose, leering mouth.)_ I tried her things on only twice,
LINE 2499: a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to
LINE 2500: save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest
LINE 2501: thrift.
LINE 2502: BELLO: _(Jeers.)_ Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed
LINE 2503: off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds
LINE 2504: your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders in various poses of
LINE 2505: surrender, eh? Ho! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop
LINE 2506: shift and short trunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her
LINE 2507: last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel,
LINE 2508: eh?
LINE 2509: BLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.
LINE 2510: BELLO: _(Guffaws.)_ Christ Almighty it's too tickling, this! You were a
LINE 2511: nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay
LINE 2512: swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be
LINE 2513: violated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.
LINE 2514: P., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,
LINE 2515: Henri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus,
LINE 2516: the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid
LINE 2517: Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. _(He guffaws
LINE 2518: again.)_ Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?
LINE 2519: BLOOM: _(Her hands and features working.)_ It was Gerald converted me
LINE 2520: to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High
LINE 2521: School play _Vice Versa_. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink,
LINE 2522: fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint
LINE 2523: and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.
LINE 2524: BELLO: _(With wicked glee.)_ Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you
LINE 2525: took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on
LINE 2526: the smoothworn throne.
LINE 2527: BLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy.
LINE 2528: _(Earnestly.)_ And really it's better the position... because often I
LINE 2529: used to wet...
LINE 2530: BELLO: _(Sternly.)_ No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the
LINE 2531: corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it
LINE 2532: standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a
LINE 2533: trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a
LINE 2534: martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.
LINE 2535: THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form
LINE 2536: of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the
LINE 2537: Black church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn
LINE 2538: at an address in D'Olier street while he presented himself indecently
LINE 2539: to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly
LINE 2540: encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an
LINE 2541: unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public
LINE 2542: conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner
LINE 2543: to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol
LINE 2544: works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to
LINE 2545: see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the
LINE 2546: gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper
LINE 2547: presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a
LINE 2548: postal order?
LINE 2549: BELLO: _(Whistles loudly.)_ Say! What was the most revolting piece of
LINE 2550: obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out!
LINE 2551: Be candid for once.
LINE 2552: _(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering,

LINE 2555: the...)_
LINE 2556: BLOOM: Don't ask me! Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought
LINE 2557: the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...
LINE 2558: BELLO: _(Peremptorily.)_ Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing.
LINE 2559: Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a
LINE 2560: line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how
LINE 2561: many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr...
LINE 2562: BLOOM: _(Docile, gurgles.)_ I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...
LINE 2563: BELLO: _(Imperiously.)_ O, get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak
LINE 2564: when you're spoken to.
LINE 2565: BLOOM: _(Bows.)_ Master! Mistress! Mantamer!
LINE 2566: _(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)_
LINE 2567: BELLO: _(Satirically.)_ By day you will souse and bat our smelling
LINE 2568: underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines
LINE 2569: with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be
LINE 2570: nice? _(He places a ruby ring on her finger.)_ And there now! With this
LINE 2571: ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.
LINE 2572: BLOOM: Thank you, mistress.
LINE 2573: BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in
LINE 2574: the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one.
LINE 2575: Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like
LINE 2576: champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I'll
LINE 2577: lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right
LINE 2578: well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your
LINE 2579: ways. At night your wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear
LINE 2580: fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately
LINE 2581: scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their
LINE 2582: lives. _(He chuckles.)_ My boys will be no end charmed to see you so
LINE 2583: ladylike, the colonel, above all, when they come here the night before
LINE 2584: the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First I'll
LINE 2585: have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta
LINE 2586: Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the
LINE 2587: Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work
LINE 2588: at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers?
LINE 2589: _(He points.)_ For that lot. Trained by owner to fetch and carry,
LINE 2590: basket in mouth. _(He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's
LINE 2591: vulva.)_ There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a
LINE 2592: hardon? _(He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.)_ Here wet the deck and
LINE 2593: wipe it round!
LINE 2594: A BIDDER: A florin.
LINE 2595: _(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)_
LINE 2596: THE LACQUEY: Barang!
LINE 2597: A VOICE: One and eightpence too much.
LINE 2598: CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.
LINE 2599: BELLO: _(Gives a rap with his gavel.)_ Two bar. Rockbottom figure and
LINE 2600: cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine shis points.
LINE 2601: Handle hrim. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If
LINE 2602: I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid
LINE 2603: gallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His
LINE 2604: sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.
LINE 2605: Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! _(He brands his initial C on Bloom's
LINE 2606: croup.)_ So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?
LINE 2607: A DARKVISAGED MAN: _(In disguised accent.)_ Hoondert punt sterlink.
LINE 2608: VOICES: _(Subdued.)_ For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.
LINE 2609: BELLO: _(Gaily.)_ Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short
LINE 2610: skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a
LINE 2611: potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long
LINE 2612: straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better
LINE 2613: instincts of the _blasé_ man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk
LINE 2614: on four inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,
LINE 2615: the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of
LINE 2616: fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.
LINE 2617: BLOOM: _(Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with
LINE 2618: forefinger in mouth.)_ O, I know what you're hinting at now!
LINE 2619: BELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? _(He
LINE 2620: stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds
LINE 2621: of Bloom's haunches.)_ Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's
LINE 2622: your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing,
LINE 2623: birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a
LINE 2624: cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. _(Loudly.)_ Can you do a man's
LINE 2625: job?
LINE 2626: BLOOM: Eccles street...
LINE 2627: BELLO: _(Sarcastically.)_ I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world
LINE 2628: but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned,
LINE 2629: my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well
LINE 2630: for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and
LINE 2631: warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee
LINE 2632: to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red
LINE 2633: hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine
LINE 2634: months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in
LINE 2635: her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? _(He
LINE 2636: spits in contempt.)_ Spittoon!
LINE 2637: BLOOM: I was indecently treated, I... Inform the police. Hundred
LINE 2638: pounds. Unmentionable. I...
LINE 2639: BELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your
LINE 2640: drizzle.
LINE 2641: BLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll... We... Still...
LINE 2642: BELLO: _(Ruthlessly.)_ No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's
LINE 2643: will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty
LINE 2644: years. Return and see.
LINE 2645: _(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)_
LINE 2646: SLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Rip van Winkle!
LINE 2647: BLOOM: _(In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing,
LINE 2648: fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the
LINE 2649: diamond panes, cries out.)_ I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat
LINE 2650: Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and
LINE 2651: he...
LINE 2652: BELLO: _(Laughs mockingly.)_ That's your daughter, you owl, with a
LINE 2653: Mullingar student.
LINE 2654: _(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf
LINE 2655: in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and
LINE 2656: calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)_
LINE 2657: MILLY: My! It's Papli! But, O Papli, how old you've grown!
LINE 2658: BELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,
LINE 2659: aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and
LINE 2660: his menfriends are living there in clover. The _Cuckoos' Rest!_ Why
LINE 2661: not? How many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets,
LINE 2662: flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male
LINE 2663: prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about.
LINE 2664: Sauce for the goose, my gander O.
LINE 2665: BLOOM: They... I...
LINE 2666: BELLO: _(Cuttingly.)_ Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet
LINE 2667: you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to
LINE 2668: find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue
LINE 2669: you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate
LINE 2670: the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your
LINE 2671: handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in
LINE 2672: your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.
LINE 2673: BLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will
LINE 2674: return. I will prove...
LINE 2675: A VOICE: Swear!
LINE 2676: _(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his
LINE 2677: teeth.)_
LINE 2678: BELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your
LINE 2679: secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You
LINE 2680: are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.
LINE 2681: BLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody...? _(He bites his
LINE 2682: thumb.)_
LINE 2683: BELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or
LINE 2684: grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you
LINE 2685: skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have!
LINE 2686: If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury
LINE 2687: you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck
LINE 2688: Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and
LINE 2689: sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,
LINE 2690: whatever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. _(He
LINE 2691: explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.)_ We'll manure you, Mr Flower! _(He
LINE 2692: pipes scoffingly.)_ Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!
LINE 2693: BLOOM: _(Clasps his head.)_ My willpower! Memory! I have sinned! I have
LINE 2694: suff...
LINE 2695: _(He weeps tearlessly.)_
LINE 2696: BELLO: _(Sneers.)_ Crybabby! Crocodile tears!
LINE 2697: _(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to
LINE 2698: the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the
LINE 2699: circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M.
LINE 2700: Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater, Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M.
LINE 2701: Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, P. Mastiansky, The Reverend Leopold
LINE 2702: Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the
LINE 2703: recreant Bloom.)_
LINE 2704: THE CIRCUMCISED: _(In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit
LINE 2705: upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad._
LINE 2706: VOICES: _(Sighing.)_ So he's gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never
LINE 2707: heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah,
LINE 2708: yes.
LINE 2709: _(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of
LINE 2710: incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with
LINE 2711: hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her
LINE 2712: grotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)_
LINE 2713: THE YEWS: _(Their leaves whispering.)_ Sister. Our sister. Ssh!
LINE 2714: THE NYMPH: _(Softly.)_ Mortal! _(Kindly.)_ Nay, dost not weepest!
LINE 2715: BLOOM: _(Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,
LINE 2716: with dignity.)_ This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of
LINE 2717: habit.
LINE 2718: THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster
LINE 2719: picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in
LINE 2720: fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical
LINE 2721: act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that
LINE 2722: smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen,
LINE 2723: stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice
LINE 2724: and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with
LINE 2725: testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.
LINE 2726: BLOOM: _(Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.)_ We have met before. On
LINE 2727: another star.
LINE 2728: THE NYMPH: _(Sadly.)_ Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the
LINE 2729: aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded.
LINE 2730: Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest
LINE 2731: exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus
LINE 2732: Rublin with photo.
LINE 2733: BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_
LINE 2734: THE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me
LINE 2735: above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in
LINE 2736: four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my
LINE 2737: shame.
LINE 2738: BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair.)_ Your classic curves, beautiful
LINE 2739: immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,
LINE 2740: almost to pray.
LINE 2741: THE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.
LINE 2742: BLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the
LINE 2743: worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of
LINE 2744: bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the
LINE 2745: rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some
LINE 2746: days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless,
LINE 2747: inoffensive vent. _(He sighs.)_ 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is
LINE 2748: marriage.
LINE 2749: THE NYMPH: _(Her fingers in her ears.)_ And words. They are not in my
LINE 2750: dictionary.
LINE 2751: BLOOM: You understood them?
LINE 2752: THE YEWS: Ssh!
LINE 2753: THE NYMPH: _(Covers her face with her hands.)_ What have I not seen in
LINE 2754: that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?
LINE 2755: BLOOM: _(Apologetically.)_ I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up
LINE 2756: with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.
LINE 2757: THE NYMPH: _(Bends her head.)_ Worse, worse!
LINE 2758: BLOOM: _(Reflects precautiously.)_ That antiquated commode. It wasn't
LINE 2759: her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds
LINE 2760: after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd
LINE 2761: orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.
LINE 2762: _(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)_
LINE 2763: THE WATERFALL:
LINE 2764: Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
LINE 2765: Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
LINE 2766: THE YEWS: _(Mingling their boughs.)_ Listen. Whisper. She is right, our
LINE 2767: sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous
LINE 2768: summer days.
LINE 2769: JOHN WYSE NOLAN: _(In the background, in Irish National Forester's
LINE 2770: uniform, doffs his plumed hat.)_ Prosper! Give shade on languorous
LINE 2771: days, trees of Ireland!
LINE 2772: THE YEWS: _(Murmuring.)_ Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School
LINE 2773: excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?
LINE 2774: BLOOM: _(Scared.)_ High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession
LINE 2775: of faculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.
LINE 2776: THE ECHO: Sham!
LINE 2777: BLOOM: _(Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript
LINE 2778: juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis
LINE 2779: shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with
LINE 2780: badge.)_ I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a
LINE 2781: jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory,
LINE 2782: the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,
LINE 2783: instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice),
LINE 2784: even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were
LINE 2785: sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.
LINE 2786: _(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and
LINE 2787: shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen
LINE 2788: Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a
LINE 2789: clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)_
LINE 2790: THE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! _(They cheer.)_
LINE 2791: BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent
LINE 2792: snowballs, struggles to rise.)_ Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark!
LINE 2793: Let's ring all the bells in Montague street. _(He cheers feebly.)_
LINE 2794: Hurray for the High School!
LINE 2795: THE ECHO: Fool!
LINE 2796: THE YEWS: _(Rustling.)_ She is right, our sister. Whisper. _(Whispered
LINE 2797: kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the
LINE 2798: boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.)_ Who
LINE 2799: profaned our silent shade?
LINE 2800: THE NYMPH: _(Coyly, through parting fingers.)_ There? In the open air?
LINE 2801: THE YEWS: _(Sweeping downward.)_ Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.
LINE 2802: THE WATERFALL:
LINE 2803: Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
LINE 2804: Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.
LINE 2805: THE NYMPH: _(With wide fingers.)_ O, infamy!
LINE 2806: BLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of
LINE 2807: the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time.
LINE 2808: Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke,
LINE 2809: flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains
LINE 2810: with poor papa's operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled
LINE 2811: downhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits.
LINE 2812: She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The
LINE 2813: demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?
LINE 2814: _(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with
LINE 2815: humid nostrils through the foliage.)_
LINE 2816: STAGGERING BOB: (_Large teardrops rolling from his prominent eyes,
LINE 2817: snivels._) Me. Me see.
LINE 2818: BLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I... _(With pathos.)_ No girl would
LINE 2819: when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play...
LINE 2820: _(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes,
LINE 2821: plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)_
LINE 2822: THE NANNYGOAT: _(Bleats.)_ Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!
LINE 2823: BLOOM: _(Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and
LINE 2824: gorsespine.)_ Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. _(He gazes
LINE 2825: intently downwards on the water.)_ Thirtytwo head over heels per
LINE 2826: second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of
LINE 2827: government printer's clerk. _(Through silversilent summer air the dummy

LINE 2829: cliff into the purple waiting waters.)_
LINE 2830: THE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!
LINE 2831: _(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the_ Erin's King
LINE 2832: _sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards
LINE 2833: the land.)_
LINE 2834: COUNCILLOR NANNETTI: _(Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced,
LINE 2835: his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.)_ When my country takes
LINE 2836: her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let
LINE 2837: my epitaph be written. I have...
LINE 2838: BLOOM: Done. Prff!
LINE 2839: THE NYMPH: _(Loftily.)_ We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a
LINE 2840: place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat
LINE 2841: electric light. _(She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing
LINE 2842: her forefinger in her mouth.)_ Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then
LINE 2843: could you...?
LINE 2844: BLOOM: _(Pawing the heather abjectly.)_ O, I have been a perfect pig.
LINE 2845: Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which
LINE 2846: add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's
LINE 2847: syringe, the ladies' friend.
LINE 2848: THE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. _(She blushes and makes a
LINE 2849: knee.)_ And the rest!
LINE 2850: BLOOM: _(Dejected.)_ Yes. _Peccavi!_ I have paid homage on that living
LINE 2851: altar where the back changes name. _(With sudden fervour.)_ For why
LINE 2852: should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?
LINE 2853: _(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the
LINE 2854: treestems, cooeeing.)_
LINE 2855: THE VOICE OF KITTY: _(In the thicket.)_ Show us one of them cushions.
LINE 2856: THE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.
LINE 2857: _(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)_
LINE 2858: THE VOICE OF LYNCH: _(In the thicket.)_ Whew! Piping hot!
LINE 2859: THE VOICE OF ZOE: _(From the thicket.)_ Came from a hot place.
LINE 2860: THE VOICE OF VIRAG: _(A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war
LINE 2861: panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over
LINE 2862: beechmast and acorns.)_ Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!
LINE 2863: BLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit
LINE 2864: where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to
LINE 2865: grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted
LINE 2866: white sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.
LINE 2867: THE WATERFALL:
LINE 2868: Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
LINE 2869: Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.
LINE 2870: THE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!
LINE 2871: THE NYMPH: _(Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple,
LINE 2872: softly, with remote eyes.)_ Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount
LINE 2873: Carmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. _(She
LINE 2874: reclines her head, sighing.)_ Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy
LINE 2875: gull waves o'er the waters dull.
LINE 2876: _(Bloom half rises. His back trouserbutton snaps.)_
LINE 2877: THE BUTTON: Bip!
LINE 2878: _(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)_
LINE 2879: THE SLUTS:
LINE 2880: O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
LINE 2881: He didn't know what to do,
LINE 2882: To keep it up,
LINE 2883: To keep it up.
LINE 2884: BLOOM: _(Coldly.)_ You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there
LINE 2885: were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy
LINE 2886: but willing like an ass pissing.
LINE 2887: THE YEWS: _(Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms
LINE 2888: aging and swaying.)_ Deciduously!
LINE 2889: THE NYMPH: _(Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her
LINE 2890: habit.)_ Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! _(A large moist stain appears
LINE 2891: on her robe.)_ Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment
LINE 2892: of a pure woman. _(She clutches again in her robe.)_ Wait. Satan,
LINE 2893: you'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. _(She draws a
LINE 2894: poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine,
LINE 2895: strikes at his loins.)_ Nekum!
LINE 2896: BLOOM: _(Starts up, seizes her hand.)_ Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o' nine
LINE 2897: lives! Fair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is
LINE 2898: it? What do you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough?
LINE 2899: _(He clutches her veil.)_ A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame
LINE 2900: gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother
LINE 2901: Alphonsus, eh Reynard?
LINE 2902: THE NYMPH: _(With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast
LINE 2903: cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.)_ Poli...!
LINE 2904: BLOOM: _(Calls after her.)_ As if you didn't get it on the double
LINE 2905: yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it.
LINE 2906: Your strength our weakness. What's our studfee? What will you pay on
LINE 2907: the nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. _(The fleeing
LINE 2908: nymph raises a keen.)_ Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour
LINE 2909: behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow,
LINE 2910: eh? Fool someone else, not me. _(He sniffs.)_ Rut. Onions. Stale.
LINE 2911: Sulphur. Grease.
LINE 2912: _(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)_
LINE 2913: BELLA: You'll know me the next time.
LINE 2914: BLOOM: _(Composed, regards her.) Passée._ Mutton dressed as lamb. Long
LINE 2915: in the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night
LINE 2916: would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your
LINE 2917: eyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the
LINE 2918: dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw
LINE 2919: propeller.
LINE 2920: BELLA: _(Contemptuously.)_ You're not game, in fact. _(Her sowcunt
LINE 2921: barks.)_ Fbhracht!
LINE 2922: BLOOM: _(Contemptuously.)_ Clean your nailless middle finger first,
LINE 2923: your bully's cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful
LINE 2924: of hay and wipe yourself.
LINE 2925: BELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!
LINE 2926: BLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!
LINE 2927: BELLA: _(Turns to the piano.)_ Which of you was playing the dead march
LINE 2928: from _Saul?_
LINE 2929: ZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. _(She darts to the piano and bangs
LINE 2930: chords on it with crossed arms.)_ The cat's ramble through the slag.
LINE 2931: _(She glances back.)_ Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? _(She darts
LINE 2932: back to the table.)_ What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.
LINE 2933: _(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom
LINE 2934: approaches Zoe.)_
LINE 2935: BLOOM: _(Gently.)_ Give me back that potato, will you?
LINE 2936: ZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.
LINE 2937: BLOOM: _(With feeling.)_ It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor
LINE 2938: mamma.
LINE 2939: ZOE:
LINE 2940: Give a thing and take it back
LINE 2941: God'll ask you where is that
LINE 2942: You'll say you don't know
LINE 2943: God'll send you down below.
LINE 2944: BLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.
LINE 2945: STEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.
LINE 2946: ZOE: Here. _(She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,
LINE 2947: and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.)_ Those that hides
LINE 2948: knows where to find.
LINE 2949: BELLA: _(Frowns.)_ Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you
LINE 2950: smash that piano. Who's paying here?
LINE 2951: _(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking
LINE 2952: out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)_
LINE 2953: STEPHEN: _(With exaggerated politeness.)_ This silken purse I made out
LINE 2954: of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. _(He
LINE 2955: indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.)_ We are all in the same sweepstake,
LINE 2956: Kinch and Lynch. _Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état_.
LINE 2957: LYNCH: _(Calls from the hearth.)_ Dedalus! Give her your blessing for
LINE 2958: me.
LINE 2959: STEPHEN: _(Hands Bella a coin.)_ Gold. She has it.
LINE 2960: BELLA: _(Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and
LINE 2961: Kitty.)_ Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.
LINE 2962: STEPHEN: _(Delightedly.)_ A hundred thousand apologies. _(He fumbles
LINE 2963: again and takes out and hands her two crowns.)_ Permit, _brevi manu_,
LINE 2964: my sight is somewhat troubled.
LINE 2965: _(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to
LINE 2966: himself in monosyllables. Zoe bends over the table. Kitty leans over
LINE 2967: Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist,
LINE 2968: adds his head to the group.)_
LINE 2969: FLORRY: _(Strives heavily to rise.)_ Ow! My foot's asleep. _(She limps
LINE 2970: over to the table. Bloom approaches.)_
LINE 2971: BELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: _(Chattering and squabbling.)_ The
LINE 2972: gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three... allow me a
LINE 2973: moment... this gentleman pays separate... who's touching it?... ow! ...
LINE 2974: mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short
LINE 2975: time?... who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentleman paid
LINE 2976: down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.
LINE 2977: STEPHEN: _(At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.)_ No
LINE 2978: bottles! What, eleven? A riddle!
LINE 2979: ZOE: _(Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the
LINE 2980: top of her stocking.)_ Hard earned on the flat of my back.
LINE 2981: LYNCH: _(Lifting Kitty from the table.)_ Come!
LINE 2982: KITTY: Wait. _(She clutches the two crowns.)_
LINE 2983: FLORRY: And me?
LINE 2984: LYNCH: Hoopla!
LINE 2985: _(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)_
LINE 2986: STEPHEN:
LINE 2987: The fox crew, the cocks flew,
LINE 2988: The bells in heaven
LINE 2989: Were striking eleven.
LINE 2990: 'Tis time for her poor soul
LINE 2991: To get out of heaven.
LINE 2992: BLOOM: _(Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and
LINE 2993: Florry.)_ So. Allow me. _(He takes up the poundnote.)_ Three times ten.
LINE 2994: We're square.
LINE 2995: BELLA: _(Admiringly.)_ You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss
LINE 2996: you.
LINE 2997: ZOE: _(Points.)_ Him? Deep as a drawwell. _(Lynch bends Kitty back over
LINE 2998: the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)_
LINE 2999: BLOOM: This is yours.
LINE 3000: STEPHEN: How is that? _Le distrait_ or absentminded beggar. _(He
LINE 3001: fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object
LINE 3002: falls.)_ That fell.
LINE 3003: BLOOM: _(Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.)_ This.
LINE 3004: STEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.
LINE 3005: BLOOM: _(Quietly.)_ You had better hand over that cash to me to take
LINE 3006: care of. Why pay more?
LINE 3007: STEPHEN: _(Hands him all his coins.)_ Be just before you are generous.
LINE 3008: BLOOM: I will but is it wise? _(He counts.)_ One, seven, eleven, and
LINE 3009: five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.
LINE 3010: STEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next
LINE 3011: Lessing says. Thirsty fox. _(He laughs loudly.)_ Burying his
LINE 3012: grandmother. Probably he killed her.
LINE 3013: BLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.
LINE 3014: STEPHEN: Doesn't matter a rambling damn.
LINE 3015: BLOOM: No, but...
LINE 3016: STEPHEN: _(Comes to the table.)_ Cigarette, please. _(Lynch tosses a
LINE 3017: cigarette from the sofa to the table.)_ And so Georgina Johnson is dead
LINE 3018: and married. _(A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.)_
LINE 3019: Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. _(He strikes a match and proceeds
LINE 3020: to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)_
LINE 3021: LYNCH: _(Watching him.)_ You would have a better chance of lighting it
LINE 3022: if you held the match nearer.
LINE 3023: STEPHEN: _(Brings the match near his eye.)_ Lynx eye. Must get glasses.
LINE 3024: Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all
LINE 3025: flat. _(He draws the match away. It goes out.)_ Brain thinks. Near:
LINE 3026: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. _(He frowns mysteriously.)_
LINE 3027: Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.
LINE 3028: ZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with
LINE 3029: him.
LINE 3030: FLORRY: _(Nods.)_ Mr Lambe from London.
LINE 3031: STEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.
LINE 3032: LYNCH: _(Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis
LINE 3033: pacem._
LINE 3034: _(The cigarette slips from Stephen's fingers. Bloom picks it up and
LINE 3035: throws it in the grate.)_
LINE 3036: BLOOM: Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. _(To Zoe.)_ You
LINE 3037: have nothing?
LINE 3038: ZOE: Is he hungry?
LINE 3039: STEPHEN: _(Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the
LINE 3040: bloodoath in the_ Dusk of the Gods.)
LINE 3041: Hangende Hunger,
LINE 3042: Fragende Frau,
LINE 3043: Macht uns alle kaputt.
LINE 3044: ZOE: _(Tragically.)_ Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! _(She takes his
LINE 3045: hand.)_ Blue eyes beauty I'll read your hand. _(She points to his
LINE 3046: forehead.)_ No wit, no wrinkles. _(She counts.)_ Two, three, Mars,
LINE 3047: that's courage. _(Stephen shakes his head.)_ No kid.
LINE 3048: LYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and
LINE 3049: shake. _(To Zoe.)_ Who taught you palmistry?
LINE 3050: ZOE: _(Turns.)_ Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. _(To Stephen.)_ I
LINE 3051: see it in your face. The eye, like that. _(She frowns with lowered
LINE 3052: head.)_
LINE 3053: LYNCH: _(Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.)_ Like that. Pandybat.
LINE 3054: _(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open,
LINE 3055: the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs
LINE 3056: up.)_
LINE 3057: FATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle
LINE 3058: little schemer. See it in your eye.
LINE 3059: _(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises
LINE 3060: from the pianola coffin.)_
LINE 3061: DON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a
LINE 3062: very good little boy!
LINE 3063: ZOE: _(Examining Stephen's palm.)_ Woman's hand.
LINE 3064: STEPHEN: _(Murmurs.)_ Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could
LINE 3065: read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.
LINE 3066: ZOE: What day were you born?
LINE 3067: STEPHEN: Thursday. Today.
LINE 3068: ZOE: Thursday's child has far to go. _(She traces lines on his hand.)_
LINE 3069: Line of fate. Influential friends.
LINE 3070: FLORRY: _(Pointing.)_ Imagination.
LINE 3071: ZOE: Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... _(She peers at his hands
LINE 3072: abruptly.)_ I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to
LINE 3073: know?
LINE 3074: BLOOM: _(Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.)_ More harm than
LINE 3075: good. Here. Read mine.
LINE 3076: BELLA: Show. _(She turns up Bloom's hand.)_ I thought so. Knobby
LINE 3077: knuckles for the women.
LINE 3078: ZOE: _(Peering at Bloom's palm.)_ Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and
LINE 3079: marry money.
LINE 3080: BLOOM: Wrong.
LINE 3081: ZOE: _(Quickly.)_ O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband.
LINE 3082: That wrong?
LINE 3083: _(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises,
LINE 3084: stretches her wings and clucks.)_
LINE 3085: BLACK LIZ: Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.
LINE 3086: _(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)_
LINE 3087: BLOOM: _(Points to his hand.)_ That weal there is an accident. Fell and
LINE 3088: cut it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.
LINE 3089: ZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.
LINE 3090: STEPHEN: See? Moves to one great goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen years
LINE 3091: ago he was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled.
LINE 3092: Twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. _(He winces.)_
LINE 3093: Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?
LINE 3094: _(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and
LINE 3095: writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)_
LINE 3096: FLORRY: What?
LINE 3097: _(A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a
LINE 3098: gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue,
LINE 3099: Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the
LINE 3100: sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the
LINE 3101: crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)_
LINE 3102: THE BOOTS: _(Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling
LINE 3103: wormfingers.)_ Haw haw have you the horn?
LINE 3104: _(Bronze by gold they whisper.)_
LINE 3105: ZOE: _(To Florry.)_ Whisper.
LINE 3106: _(They whisper again.)_
LINE 3107: _(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set
LINE 3108: sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan in yachtsman's cap and
LINE 3109: white shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan's coat
LINE 3110: shoulder.)_
LINE 3111: LENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a
LINE 3112: few quims?
LINE 3113: BOYLAN: _(Sated, smiles.)_ Plucking a turkey.
LINE 3114: LENEHAN: A good night's work.
LINE 3115: BOYLAN: _(Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.)_ Blazes
LINE 3116: Kate! Up to sample or your money back. _(He holds out a forefinger.)_
LINE 3117: Smell that.
LINE 3118: LENEHAN: _(Smells gleefully.)_ Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!
LINE 3119: ZOE AND FLORRY: _(Laugh together.)_ Ha ha ha ha.
LINE 3120: BOYLAN: _(Jumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear.)_
LINE 3121: Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom dressed yet?
LINE 3122: BLOOM: _(In flunkey's prune plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings
LINE 3123: and powdered wig.)_ I'm afraid not, sir. The last articles...
LINE 3124: BOYLAN: _(Tosses him sixpence.)_ Here, to buy yourself a gin and
LINE 3125: splash. _(He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.)_
LINE 3126: Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife, you
LINE 3127: understand?
LINE 3128: BLOOM: Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.
LINE 3129: MARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. _(She plops splashing
LINE 3130: out of the water.)_ Raoul darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt.
LINE 3131: Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.
LINE 3132: BOYLAN: _(A merry twinkle in his eye.)_ Topping!
LINE 3133: BELLA: What? What is it?
LINE 3134: _(Zoe whispers to her.)_
LINE 3135: MARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll
LINE 3136: write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to
LINE 3137: raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a
LINE 3138: signed and stamped receipt.
LINE 3139: BOYLAN: (Clasps himself.) Here, I can't hold this little lot much
LINE 3140: longer. (He strides off on stiff cavalry legs.)
LINE 3141: BELLA: _(Laughing.)_ Ho ho ho ho.
LINE 3142: BOYLAN: _(To Bloom, over his shoulder.)_ You can apply your eye to the
LINE 3143: keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.
LINE 3144: BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to
LINE 3145: witness the deed and take a snapshot? _(He holds out an ointment jar.)_
LINE 3146: Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower...? Lukewarm water...?
LINE 3147: KITTY: _(From the sofa.)_ Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What...
LINE 3148: _(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping
LINE 3149: loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)_
LINE 3150: MINA KENNEDY: _(Her eyes upturned.)_ O, it must be like the scent of
LINE 3151: geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!
LINE 3152: Stuck together! Covered with kisses!
LINE 3153: LYDIA DOUCE: _(Her mouth opening.)_ Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round
LINE 3154: the room doing it! Ride a cockhorse. You could hear them in Paris and
LINE 3155: New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.
LINE 3156: KITTY: _(Laughing.)_ Hee hee hee.
LINE 3157: BOYLAN'S VOICE: _(Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.)_ Ah!
LINE 3158: Godblazeqrukbrukarchkrasht!
LINE 3159: MARION'S VOICE: _(Hoarsely, sweetly, rising to her throat.)_ O!
LINE 3160: Weeshwashtkissinapooisthnapoohuck?
LINE 3161: BLOOM: _(His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself.)_ Show! Hide! Show!
LINE 3162: Plough her! More! Shoot!
LINE 3163: BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY, KITTY: Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!
LINE 3164: LYNCH: _(Points.)_ The mirror up to nature. _(He laughs.)_ Hu hu hu hu
LINE 3165: hu!
LINE 3166: _(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William
LINE 3167: Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis,
LINE 3168: crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the
LINE 3169: hall.)_
LINE 3170: SHAKESPEARE: _(In dignified ventriloquy.)_ 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks
LINE 3171: the vacant mind. _(To Bloom.)_ Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest
LINE 3172: invisible. Gaze. _(He crows with a black capon's laugh.)_ Iagogo! How
LINE 3173: my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!
LINE 3174: BLOOM: _(Smiles yellowly at the three whores.)_ When will I hear the
LINE 3175: joke?
LINE 3176: ZOE: Before you're twice married and once a widower.
LINE 3177: BLOOM: Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon when measurements
LINE 3178: were taken next the skin after his death...
LINE 3179: _(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with
LINE 3180: deathtalk, tears and Tunney's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds,
LINE 3181: her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen
LINE 3182: chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late

LINE 3547: BELLA: Do you want me to call the police?
LINE 3548: BLOOM: O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student.
LINE 3549: Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. _(He makes
LINE 3550: a masonic sign.)_ Know what I mean? Nephew of the vicechancellor. You
LINE 3551: don't want a scandal.
LINE 3552: BELLA: _(Angrily.)_ Trinity. Coming down here ragging after the
LINE 3553: boatraces and paying nothing. Are you my commander here or? Where is
LINE 3554: he? I'll charge him! Disgrace him, I will! _(She shouts.)_ Zoe! Zoe!
LINE 3555: BLOOM: _(Urgently.)_ And if it were your own son in Oxford?
LINE 3556: _(Warningly.)_ I know.
LINE 3557: BELLA: _(Almost speechless.)_ Who are. Incog!
LINE 3558: ZOE: _(In the doorway.)_ There's a row on.
LINE 3559: BLOOM: What? Where? _(He throws a shilling on the table and starts.)_
LINE 3560: That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air.
LINE 3561: _(He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows,
LINE 3562: spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores
LINE 3563: clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared
LINE 3564: off. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front
LINE 3565: of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is
LINE 3566: about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his
LINE 3567: face. Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. They blow
LINE 3568: ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly
LINE 3569: lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty
LINE 3570: still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood
LINE 3571: and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun
LINE 3572: al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the
LINE 3573: railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn
LINE 3574: envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of
LINE 3575: bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in
LINE 3576: tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking
LINE 3577: up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away,
LINE 3578: throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He
LINE 3579: walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with

LINE 3611: STEPHEN: _(With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.)_ You
LINE 3612: are my guests. Uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh
LINE 3613: of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.
LINE 3614: PRIVATE CARR: _(To Cissy Caffrey.)_ Was he insulting you?
LINE 3615: STEPHEN: Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter.
LINE 3616: Ungenitive.
LINE 3617: VOICES: No, he didn't. I seen him. The girl there. He was in Mrs
LINE 3618: Cohen's. What's up? Soldier and civilian.
LINE 3619: CISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to

LINE 3622: STEPHEN: _(Catches sight of Lynch's and Kitty's heads.)_ Hail,

LINE 3624: VOICES: Shes faithfultheman.
LINE 3625: CISSY CAFFREY: Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.
LINE 3626: PRIVATE COMPTON: He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff
LINE 3627: him one, Harry.
LINE 3628: PRIVATE CARR: _(To Cissy.)_ Was he insulting you while me and him was
LINE 3629: having a piss?
LINE 3630: LORD TENNYSON: _(Gentleman poet in Union Jack blazer and cricket
LINE 3631: flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.)_ Theirs not to reason why.
LINE 3632: PRIVATE COMPTON: Biff him, Harry.
LINE 3633: STEPHEN: _(To Private Compton.)_ I don't know your name but you are
LINE 3634: quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in
LINE 3635: their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.
LINE 3636: CISSY CAFFREY: _(To the crowd.)_ No, I was with the privates.
LINE 3637: STEPHEN: _(Amiably.)_ Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion
LINE 3638: every lady for example...
LINE 3639: PRIVATE CARR: _(His cap awry, advances to Stephen.)_ Say, how would it
LINE 3640: be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?
LINE 3641: STEPHEN: _(Looks up to the sky.)_ How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of
LINE 3642: selfpretence. Personally, I detest action. _(He waves his hand.)_ Hand
LINE 3643: hurts me slightly. _Enfin ce sont vos oignons._ _(To Cissy Caffrey.)_
LINE 3644: Some trouble is on here. What is it precisely?
LINE 3645: DOLLY GRAY: _(From her balcony waves her handkerchief, giving the sign
LINE 3646: of the heroine of Jericho.)_ Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to
LINE 3647: Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.
LINE 3648: _(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)_
LINE 3649: BLOOM: _(Elbowing through the crowd, plucks Stephen's sleeve
LINE 3650: vigorously.)_ Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.
LINE 3651: STEPHEN: _(Turns.)_ Eh? _(He disengages himself.)_ Why should I not
LINE 3652: speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate
LINE 3653: orange? _(He points his finger.)_ I'm not afraid of what I can talk to
LINE 3654: if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.
LINE 3655: _(He staggers a pace back.)_
LINE 3656: BLOOM: _(Propping him.)_ Retain your own.
LINE 3657: STEPHEN: _(Laughs emptily.)_ My centre of gravity is displaced. I have
LINE 3658: forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle
LINE 3659: for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably
LINE 3660: the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. _(He taps
LINE 3661: his brow.)_ But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.
LINE 3662: BIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor
LINE 3663: out of the college.
LINE 3664: CUNTY KATE: I did. I heard that.
LINE 3665: BIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of
LINE 3666: phraseology.
LINE 3667: CUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite
LINE 3668: trenchancy.
LINE 3669: PRIVATE CARR: _(Pulls himself free and comes forward.)_ What's that
LINE 3670: you're saying about my king?
LINE 3671: _(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on
LINE 3672: which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of
LINE 3673: Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner's and
LINE 3674: Probyn's horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable
LINE 3675: artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed
LINE 3676: as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron,
LINE 3677: marked_ made in Germany. _In his left hand he holds a plasterer's
LINE 3678: bucket on which is printed_ Défense d'uriner. _A roar of welcome greets
LINE 3679: him.)_
LINE 3680: EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.)_ Peace,
LINE 3681: perfect peace. For identification, bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys.
LINE 3682: _(He turns to his subjects.)_ We have come here to witness a clean
LINE 3683: straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck.
LINE 3684: Mahak makar a bak.
LINE 3685: _(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom
LINE 3686: and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket
LINE 3687: graciously in acknowledgment.)_
LINE 3688: PRIVATE CARR: _(To Stephen.)_ Say it again.
LINE 3689: STEPHEN: _(Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.)_ I understand your
LINE 3690: point of view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the
LINE 3691: age of patent medicines. A discussion is difficult down here. But this
LINE 3692: is the point. You die for your country. Suppose. _(He places his arm on
LINE 3693: Private Carr's sleeve.)_ Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my
LINE 3694: country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I didn't want it
LINE 3695: to die. Damn death. Long live life!
LINE 3696: EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and
LINE 3697: with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent
LINE 3698: face.)_
LINE 3699: My methods are new and are causing surprise.
LINE 3700: To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.
LINE 3701: STEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! _(He falls back a pace.)_ Come somewhere
LINE 3702: and we'll... What was that girl saying?...
LINE 3703: PRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one
LINE 3704: into Jerry.
LINE 3705: BLOOM: _(To the privates, softly.)_ He doesn't know what he's saying.
LINE 3706: Taken a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster.
LINE 3707: I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.
LINE 3708: STEPHEN: _(Nods, smiling and laughing.)_ Gentleman, patriot, scholar
LINE 3709: and judge of impostors.
LINE 3710: PRIVATE CARR: I don't give a bugger who he is.
LINE 3711: PRIVATE COMPTON: We don't give a bugger who he is.
LINE 3712: STEPHEN: I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.
LINE 3713: _(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day
LINE 3714: boy's hat signs to Stephen.)_
LINE 3715: KEVIN EGAN: H'lo! _Bonjour!_ The _vieille ogresse_ with the _dents
LINE 3716: jaunes_.
LINE 3717: _(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbitface nibbling a quince
LINE 3718: leaf.)_
LINE 3719: PATRICE: _Socialiste!_
LINE 3720: DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY: _(In medieval hauberk,
LINE 3721: two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a
LINE 3722: mailed hand against the privates.)_ Werf those eykes to footboden, big
LINE 3723: grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!
LINE 3724: BLOOM: _(To Stephen.)_ Come home. You'll get into trouble.
LINE 3725: STEPHEN: _(Swaying.)_ I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.
LINE 3726: BIDDY THE CLAP: One immediately observes that he is of patrician
LINE 3727: lineage.
LINE 3728: THE VIRAGO: Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.
LINE 3729: THE BAWD: The red's as good as the green. And better. Up the soldiers!
LINE 3730: Up King Edward!
LINE 3731: A ROUGH: _(Laughs.)_ Ay! Hands up to De Wet.
LINE 3732: THE CITIZEN: _(With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)_
LINE 3733: May the God above
LINE 3734: Send down a dove
LINE 3735: With teeth as sharp as razors
LINE 3736: To slit the throats
LINE 3737: Of the English dogs
LINE 3738: That hanged our Irish leaders.
LINE 3739: THE CROPPY BOY: _(The ropenoose round his neck, gripes in his issuing
LINE 3740: bowels with both hands.)_
LINE 3741: I bear no hate to a living thing,
LINE 3742: But I love my country beyond the king.
LINE 3743: RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER: _(Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants,
LINE 3744: advances with gladstone bag which he opens.)_ Ladies and gents, cleaver
LINE 3745: purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin
LINE 3746: dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the
LINE 3747: cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear.
LINE 3748: Phial containing arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent
LINE 3749: Seddon to the gallows.
LINE 3750: _(He jerks the rope. The assistants leap at the victim's legs and drag
LINE 3751: him downward, grunting: the croppy boy's tongue protrudes violently.)_
LINE 3752: THE CROPPY BOY:
LINE 3753: Horhot ho hray hor hother's hest.
LINE 3754: _(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts
LINE 3755: of sperm spouting through his deathclothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs
LINE 3756: Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys
LINE 3757: rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)_
LINE 3758: RUMBOLD: I'm near it myself. _(He undoes the noose.)_ Rope which hanged
LINE 3759: the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time. As applied to Her Royal
LINE 3760: Highness. _(He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and
LINE 3761: draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.)_ My
LINE 3762: painful duty has now been done. God save the king!
LINE 3763: EDWARD THE SEVENTH: _(Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket, and
LINE 3764: sings with soft contentment.)_
LINE 3765: On coronation day, on coronation day,
LINE 3766: O, won't we have a merry time,
LINE 3767: Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
LINE 3768: PRIVATE CARR: Here. What are you saying about my king?
LINE 3769: STEPHEN: _(Throws up his hands.)_ O, this is too monotonous! Nothing.
LINE 3770: He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some
LINE 3771: brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. _(He searches his pockets
LINE 3772: vaguely.)_ Gave it to someone.
LINE 3773: PRIVATE CARR: Who wants your bleeding money?
LINE 3774: STEPHEN: _(Tries to move off.)_ Will someone tell me where I am least
LINE 3775: likely to meet these necessary evils? _Ça se voit aussi à Paris._ Not
LINE 3776: that I... But, by Saint Patrick...!
LINE 3777: _(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears
LINE 3778: seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her
LINE 3779: breast.)_
LINE 3780: STEPHEN: Aha! I know you, gammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that
LINE 3781: eats her farrow!
LINE 3782: OLD GUMMY GRANNY: _(Rocking to and fro.)_ Ireland's sweetheart, the
LINE 3783: king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to
LINE 3784: them! _(She keens with banshee woe.)_ Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine!
LINE 3785: _(She wails.)_ You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?
LINE 3786: STEPHEN: How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of
LINE 3787: the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.
LINE 3788: CISSY CAFFREY: _(Shrill.)_ Stop them from fighting!
LINE 3789: A ROUGH: Our men retreated.
LINE 3790: PRIVATE CARR: _(Tugging at his belt.)_ I'll wring the neck of any
LINE 3791: fucker says a word against my fucking king.
LINE 3792: BLOOM: _(Terrified.)_ He said nothing. Not a word. A pure
LINE 3793: misunderstanding.
LINE 3794: THE CITIZEN: _Erin go bragh!_
LINE 3795: _(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals,
LINE 3796: decorations, trophies of war, wounds. Both salute with fierce

LINE 3799: STEPHEN: Did I? When?
LINE 3800: BLOOM: _(To the redcoats.)_ We fought for you in South Africa, Irish

LINE 3830: you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. _(She cries.)_ Police!
LINE 3831: STEPHEN: _(Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)_
LINE 3832: White thy fambles, red thy gan
LINE 3833: And thy quarrons dainty is.
LINE 3834: VOICES: Police!

LINE 3892: fucking windpipe!
LINE 3893: _(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)_
LINE 3894: OLD GUMMY GRANNY: _(Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.)_ Remove
LINE 3895: him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be
LINE 3896: free. _(She prays.)_ O good God, take him!
LINE 3897: BLOOM: _(Runs to Lynch.)_ Can't you get him away?
LINE 3898: LYNCH: He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! _(To Bloom.)_
LINE 3899: Get him away, you. He won't listen to me.
LINE 3900: _(He drags Kitty away.)_
LINE 3901: STEPHEN: _(Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit._
LINE 3902: BLOOM: _(Runs to Stephen.)_ Come along with me now before worse
LINE 3903: happens. Here's your stick.
LINE 3904: STEPHEN: Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.
LINE 3905: CISSY CAFFREY: _(Pulling Private Carr.)_ Come on, you're boosed. He
LINE 3906: insulted me but I forgive him. _(Shouting in his ear.)_ I forgive him
LINE 3907: for insulting me.
LINE 3908: BLOOM: _(Over Stephen's shoulder.)_ Yes, go. You see he's incapable.
LINE 3909: PRIVATE CARR: _(Breaks loose.)_ I'll insult him.
LINE 3910: _(He rushes towards Stephen, fist outstretched, and strikes him in the
LINE 3911: face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls, stunned. He lies prone, his
LINE 3912: face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks
LINE 3913: it up.)_
LINE 3914: MAJOR TWEEDY: _(Loudly.)_ Carbine in bucket! Cease fire! Salute!
LINE 3915: THE RETRIEVER: _(Barking furiously.)_ Ute ute ute ute ute ute ute ute.
LINE 3916: THE CROWD: Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The
LINE 3917: soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him!
LINE 3918: He's fainted!
LINE 3919: A HAG: What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under
LINE 3920: the influence. Let them go and fight the Boers!
LINE 3921: THE BAWD: Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go
LINE 3922: with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.
LINE 3923: _(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)_
LINE 3924: THE RETRIEVER: _(Barking.)_ Wow wow wow.
LINE 3925: BLOOM: _(Shoves them back, loudly.)_ Get back, stand back!
LINE 3926: PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Tugging his comrade.)_ Here. Bugger off, Harry.
LINE 3927: Here's the cops! _(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group.)_
LINE 3928: FIRST WATCH: What's wrong here?
LINE 3929: PRIVATE COMPTON: We were with this lady. And he insulted us. And
LINE 3930: assaulted my chum. _(The retriever barks.)_ Who owns the bleeding tyke?
LINE 3931: CISSY CAFFREY: _(With expectation.)_ Is he bleeding!
LINE 3932: A MAN: _(Rising from his knees.)_ No. Gone off. He'll come to all
LINE 3933: right.
LINE 3934: BLOOM: _(Glances sharply at the man.)_ Leave him to me. I can easily...
LINE 3935: SECOND WATCH: Who are you? Do you know him?
LINE 3936: PRIVATE CARR: _(Lurches towards the watch.)_ He insulted my lady
LINE 3937: friend.
LINE 3938: BLOOM: _(Angrily.)_ You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness.
LINE 3939: Constable, take his regimental number.
LINE 3940: SECOND WATCH: I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my
LINE 3941: duty.
LINE 3942: PRIVATE COMPTON: _(Pulling his comrade.)_ Here, bugger off Harry. Or
LINE 3943: Bennett'll shove you in the lockup.
LINE 3944: PRIVATE CARR: _(Staggering as he is pulled away.)_ God fuck old
LINE 3945: Bennett. He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.
LINE 3946: FIRST WATCH: _(Takes out his notebook.)_ What's his name?
LINE 3947: BLOOM: _(Peering over the crowd.)_ I just see a car there. If you give
LINE 3948: me a hand a second, sergeant...
LINE 3949: FIRST WATCH: Name and address.
LINE 3950: _(Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,
LINE 3951: appears among the bystanders.)_
LINE 3952: BLOOM: _(Quickly.)_ O, the very man! _(He whispers.)_ Simon Dedalus'
LINE 3953: son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.
LINE 3954: SECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher.
LINE 3955: CORNY KELLEHER: _(To the watch, with drawling eye.)_ That's all right.
LINE 3956: I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. _(He laughs.)_
LINE 3957: Twenty to one. Do you follow me?
LINE 3958: FIRST WATCH: _(Turns to the crowd.)_ Here, what are you all gaping at?
LINE 3959: Move on out of that.
LINE 3960: _(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)_
LINE 3961: CORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. _(He
LINE 3962: laughs, shaking his head.)_ We were often as bad ourselves, ay or
LINE 3963: worse. What? Eh, what?
LINE 3964: FIRST WATCH: _(Laughs.)_ I suppose so.
LINE 3965: CORNY KELLEHER: _(Nudges the second watch.)_ Come and wipe your name
LINE 3966: off the slate. _(He lilts, wagging his head.)_ With my tooraloom
LINE 3967: tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?
LINE 3968: SECOND WATCH: _(Genially.)_ Ah, sure we were too.
LINE 3969: CORNY KELLEHER: _(Winking.)_ Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.
LINE 3970: SECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.
LINE 3971: CORNY KELLEHER: I'll see to that.
LINE 3972: BLOOM: _(Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.)_ Thank you very
LINE 3973: much, gentlemen. Thank you. _(He mumbles confidentially.)_ We don't
LINE 3974: want any scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly
LINE 3975: respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.
LINE 3976: FIRST WATCH: O. I understand, sir.
LINE 3977: SECOND WATCH: That's all right, sir.
LINE 3978: FIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have to
LINE 3979: report it at the station.
LINE 3980: BLOOM: _(Nods rapidly.)_ Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden
LINE 3981: duty.
LINE 3982: SECOND WATCH: It's our duty.
LINE 3983: CORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.
LINE 3984: THE WATCH: _(Saluting together.)_ Night, gentlemen. _(They move off
LINE 3985: with slow heavy tread.)_
LINE 3986: BLOOM: _(Blows.)_ Providential you came on the scene. You have a
LINE 3987: car?...
LINE 3988: CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to
LINE 3989: the car brought up against the scaffolding.)_ Two commercials that were
LINE 3990: standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two
LINE 3991: quid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the
LINE 3992: jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.
LINE 3993: BLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...
LINE 3994: CORNY KELLEHER: _(Laughs.)_ Sure they wanted me to join in with the
LINE 3995: mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself.
LINE 3996: _(He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.)_ Thanks be to God we
LINE 3997: have it in the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!
LINE 3998: BLOOM: _(Tries to laugh.)_ He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just
LINE 3999: visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor
LINE 4000: fellow, he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together
LINE 4001: and I was just making my way home...
LINE 4002: _(The horse neighs.)_
LINE 4003: THE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!
LINE 4004: CORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after
LINE 4005: we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up
LINE 4006: and got off to see. _(He laughs.)_ Sober hearsedrivers a speciality.
LINE 4007: Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in
LINE 4008: Cabra, what?
LINE 4009: BLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.
LINE 4010: _(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint,
LINE 4011: drawls at the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)_
LINE 4012: CORNY KELLEHER: _(Scratches his nape.)_ Sandycove! _(He bends down and
LINE 4013: calls to Stephen.)_ Eh! _(He calls again.)_ Eh! He's covered with
LINE 4014: shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.
LINE 4015: BLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.
LINE 4016: CORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well,
LINE 4017: I'll shove along. _(He laughs.)_ I've a rendezvous in the morning.
LINE 4018: Burying the dead. Safe home!
LINE 4019: THE HORSE: _(Neighs.)_ Hohohohohome.
LINE 4020: BLOOM: Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...
LINE 4021: _(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse
LINE 4022: harness jingles.)_
LINE 4023: CORNY KELLEHER: _(From the car, standing.)_ Night.
LINE 4024: BLOOM: Night.
LINE 4025: _(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The
LINE 4026: car and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the
LINE 4027: sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom's plight.
LINE 4028: The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the
LINE 4029: farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb
LINE 4030: and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the
LINE 4031: sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom
LINE 4032: conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car
LINE 4033: jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny
LINE 4034: Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand
LINE 4035: assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling
LINE 4036: hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo
LINE 4037: lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen's hat, festooned with shavings,
LINE 4038: and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by
LINE 4039: the shoulder.)_
LINE 4040: BLOOM: Eh! Ho! _(There is no answer; he bends again.)_ Mr Dedalus!
LINE 4041: _(There is no answer.)_ The name if you call. Somnambulist. _(He bends
LINE 4042: again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate
LINE 4043: form.)_ Stephen! _(There is no answer. He calls again.)_ Stephen!
LINE 4044: STEPHEN: _(Groans.)_ Who? Black panther. Vampire. _(He sighs and
LINE 4045: stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)_
LINE 4046: Who... drive... Fergus now
LINE 4047: And pierce... wood's woven shade?...
LINE 4048: _(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)_
LINE 4049: BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. _(He bends again and undoes the
LINE 4050: buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.)_ To breathe. _(He brushes the
LINE 4051: woodshavings from Stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers.)_ One
LINE 4052: pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. _(He listens.)_ What?
LINE 4053: STEPHEN: _(Murmurs.)_
LINE 4054: ... shadows... the woods
LINE 4055: ... white breast... dim sea.
LINE 4056: _(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom,
LINE 4057: holding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the
LINE 4058: distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks
LINE 4059: down on Stephen's face and form.)_
LINE 4060: BLOOM: _(Communes with the night.)_ Face reminds me of his poor mother.
LINE 4061: In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A
LINE 4062: girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. _(He murmurs.)_... swear
LINE 4063: that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,
LINE 4064: art or arts... _(He murmurs.)_... in the rough sands of the sea... a
LINE 4065: cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows
LINE 4066: ...
LINE 4067: _(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips
LINE 4068: in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure
LINE 4069: appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed
LINE 4070: in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a
LINE 4071: book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling,
LINE 4072: kissing the page.)_
LINE 4073: BLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.)_ Rudy!
LINE 4074: RUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading,
LINE 4075: kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has
LINE 4076: diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory
LINE 4077: cane with a violet bowknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat
LINE 4078: pocket.)_
