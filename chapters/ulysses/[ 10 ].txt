LINE 1: The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth
LINE 2: watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five
LINE 3: to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name
LINE 4: again? Dignam. Yes. _Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the
LINE 5: person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible.
LINE 6: Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.
LINE 7: A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his
LINE 8: crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the
LINE 9: sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very
LINE 10: reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his
LINE 11: purse held, he knew, one silver crown.
LINE 12: Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,
LINE 13: of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
LINE 14: ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words:
LINE 15: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
LINE 16: abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of
LINE 17: sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy
LINE 18: M.P.
LINE 19: —Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?
LINE 20: Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton
LINE 21: probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at
LINE 22: Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear
LINE 23: that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still
LINE 24: sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful
LINE 25: indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would
LINE 26: come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man
LINE 27: really.
LINE 28: Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
LINE 29: Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.
LINE 30: Yes, he would certainly call.
LINE 31: —Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.
LINE 32: Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
LINE 33: jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,
LINE 34: in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.
LINE 35: Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
LINE 36: Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.
LINE 37: —Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?
LINE 38: A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his
LINE 39: way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.
LINE 40: Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?
LINE 41: O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.
LINE 42: Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
LINE 43: square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were
LINE 44: they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his
LINE 45: name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little
LINE 46: man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
LINE 47: Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
LINE 48: pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.
LINE 49: —But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.
LINE 50: The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
LINE 51: —O, sir.
LINE 52: —Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.
LINE 53: Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter
LINE 54: to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father
LINE 55: Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
LINE 56: east.
LINE 57: Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
LINE 58: frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
LINE 59: trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
LINE 60: deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
LINE 61: Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.
LINE 62: Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?
LINE 63: Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
LINE 64: farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and
LINE 65: saluted. How did she do?
LINE 66: A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to
LINE 67: think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he
LINE 68: say?... such a queenly mien.
LINE 69: Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the
LINE 70: shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will
LINE 71: (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on
LINE 72: him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible
LINE 73: ignorance. They acted according to their lights.
LINE 74: Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
LINE 75: road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
LINE 76: important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.
LINE 77: A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All
LINE 78: raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
LINE 79: Christian brother boys.
LINE 80: Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
LINE 81: Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father
LINE 82: Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but
LINE 83: occasionally they were also badtempered.
LINE 84: Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
LINE 85: nobleman. And now it was an office or something.
LINE 86: Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
LINE 87: by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father
LINE 88: Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
LINE 89: from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the
LINE 90: Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
LINE 91: catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually
LINE 92: happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an
LINE 93: act of perfect contrition.
LINE 94: Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of
LINE 95: which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.
LINE 96: Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny
LINE 97: Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.
LINE 98: A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
LINE 99: the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee
LINE 100: observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
LINE 101: tubes.
LINE 102: Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
LINE 103: turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
LINE 104: straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
LINE 105: him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
LINE 106: the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out
LINE 107: and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
LINE 108: people.
LINE 109: On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis
LINE 110: Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
LINE 111: tram.
LINE 112: Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of
LINE 113: saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.
LINE 114: At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
LINE 115: he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.
LINE 116: Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
LINE 117: care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
LINE 118: sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into
LINE 119: his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket
LINE 120: inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away
LINE 121: the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father
LINE 122: Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked
LINE 123: cheerful decorum.
LINE 124: It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
LINE 125: Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee
LINE 126: supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman
LINE 127: with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so
LINE 128: gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and
LINE 129: smiled tinily, sweetly.
LINE 130: Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that
LINE 131: the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
LINE 132: seat.
LINE 133: Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
LINE 134: mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
LINE 135: At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
LINE 136: woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the
LINE 137: bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a
LINE 138: marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
LINE 139: basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
LINE 140: the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
LINE 141: always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
LINE 142: absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
LINE 143: cares, poor creatures.
LINE 144: From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
LINE 145: Father Conmee.
LINE 146: Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men
LINE 147: and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission
LINE 148: and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and
LINE 149: brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when
LINE 150: their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the
LINE 151: Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a
LINE 152: reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in
LINE 153: His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But
LINE 154: they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a
LINE 155: pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.
LINE 156: At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
LINE 157: conductor and saluted in his turn.
LINE 158: The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.
LINE 159: The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,
LINE 160: immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.
LINE 161: Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
LINE 162: Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old
LINE 163: times in the barony.
LINE 164: Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
LINE 165: Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and
LINE 166: of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
LINE 167: Belvedere.
LINE 168: A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
LINE 169: Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
LINE 170: not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the
LINE 171: jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
LINE 172: adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
LINE 173: her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned
LINE 174: as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.
LINE 175: Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however
LINE 176: for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our
LINE 177: ways.
LINE 178: Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and
LINE 179: honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
LINE 180: smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
LINE 181: clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
LINE 182: were impalmed by Don John Conmee.
LINE 183: It was a charming day.
LINE 184: The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
LINE 185: curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of
LINE 186: small white clouds going slowly down the wind. _Moutonner,_ the French
LINE 187: said. A just and homely word.
LINE 188: Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
LINE 189: over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
LINE 190: Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
LINE 191: cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
LINE 192: evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.
LINE 193: Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.
LINE 194: An ivory bookmark told him the page.
LINE 195: Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had
LINE 196: come.
LINE 197: Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.
LINE 198: _Deus in adiutorium._
LINE 199: He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
LINE 200: came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
LINE 201: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._
LINE 202: A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
LINE 203: young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised
LINE 204: his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
LINE 205: detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
LINE 206: Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
LINE 207: breviary. _Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
LINE 208: formidavit cor meum._
LINE 209: * * *
LINE 210: Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping
LINE 211: eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,
LINE 212: went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
LINE 213: furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
LINE 214: to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
LINE 215: and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
LINE 216: Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.
LINE 217: Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
LINE 218: downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.
LINE 219: Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.
LINE 220: —That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.
LINE 221: —Ay, Corny Kelleher said.
LINE 222: —It's very close, the constable said.
LINE 223: Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
LINE 224: while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
LINE 225: coin.
LINE 226: —What's the best news? he asked.
LINE 227: —I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
LINE 228: bated breath.
LINE 229: * * *
LINE 230: A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting
LINE 231: Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards
LINE 232: Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
LINE 233: —_For England_...
LINE 234: He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
LINE 235: and growled:
LINE 236: —_home and beauty._
LINE 237: J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in
LINE 238: the warehouse with a visitor.
LINE 239: A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
LINE 240: into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced
LINE 241: sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself
LINE 242: forward four strides.
LINE 243: He halted and growled angrily:
LINE 244: —_For England_...
LINE 245: Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
LINE 246: gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.
LINE 247: He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
LINE 248: towards a window and bayed deeply:
LINE 249: —_home and beauty._
LINE 250: The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
LINE 251: The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card _Unfurnished
LINE 252: Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm
LINE 253: shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut
LINE 254: shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.
LINE 255: It fell on the path.
LINE 256: One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
LINE 257: minstrel's cap, saying:
LINE 258: —There, sir.
LINE 259: * * *
LINE 260: Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming
LINE 261: kitchen.
LINE 262: —Did you put in the books? Boody asked.
LINE 263: Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
LINE 264: twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.
LINE 265: —They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.
LINE 266: Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
LINE 267: tickled by stubble.
LINE 268: —Where did you try? Boody asked.
LINE 269: —M'Guinness's.
LINE 270: Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.
LINE 271: —Bad cess to her big face! she cried.
LINE 272: Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.
LINE 273: —What's in the pot? she asked.
LINE 274: —Shirts, Maggy said.
LINE 275: Boody cried angrily:
LINE 276: —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?
LINE 277: Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
LINE 278: —And what's in this?
LINE 279: A heavy fume gushed in answer.
LINE 280: —Peasoup, Maggy said.
LINE 281: —Where did you get it? Katey asked.
LINE 282: —Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.
LINE 283: The lacquey rang his bell.
LINE 284: —Barang!
LINE 285: Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
LINE 286: —Give us it here.
LINE 287: Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,
LINE 288: sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
LINE 289: mouth random crumbs:
LINE 290: —A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?
LINE 291: —Gone to meet father, Maggy said.
LINE 292: Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
LINE 293: —Our father who art not in heaven.
LINE 294: Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:
LINE 295: —Boody! For shame!
LINE 296: A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
LINE 297: Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
LINE 298: around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
LINE 299: between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.
LINE 300: * * *
LINE 301: The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling
LINE 302: fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
LINE 303: and a small jar.
LINE 304: —Put these in first, will you? he said.
LINE 305: —Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.
LINE 306: —That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.
LINE 307: She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
LINE 308: shamefaced peaches.
LINE 309: Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
LINE 310: fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
LINE 311: tomatoes, sniffing smells.
LINE 312: H. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
LINE 313: plodding towards their goal.
LINE 314: He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
LINE 315: his fob and held it at its chain's length.
LINE 316: —Can you send them by tram? Now?
LINE 317: A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's
LINE 318: cart.
LINE 319: —Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?
LINE 320: —O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.
LINE 321: The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.
LINE 322: —Will you write the address, sir?
LINE 323: Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.
LINE 324: —Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.
LINE 325: —Yes, sir. I will, sir.
LINE 326: Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.
LINE 327: —What's the damage? he asked.
LINE 328: The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.
LINE 329: Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He
LINE 330: took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.
LINE 331: —This for me? he asked gallantly.
LINE 332: The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
LINE 333: a bit crooked, blushing.
LINE 334: —Yes, sir, she said.
LINE 335: Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.
LINE 336: Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
LINE 337: red flower between his smiling teeth.
LINE 338: —May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.
LINE 339: * * *
LINE 340: _—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.
LINE 341: He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.
LINE 342: Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
LINE 343: gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their
LINE 344: stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
LINE 345: the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.
LINE 346: —_Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand' ero
LINE 347: giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. È
LINE 348: peccato. Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.
LINE 349: Invece, Lei si sacrifica._
LINE 350: —_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
LINE 351: slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.
LINE 352: _—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. _Ma, dia retta
LINE 353: a me. Ci rifletta_.
LINE 354: By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
LINE 355: unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.
LINE 356: —_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.
LINE 357: —_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.
LINE 358: His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously
LINE 359: an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.
LINE 360: _—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. _Venga a trovarmi
LINE 361: e ci pensi. Addio, caro._
LINE 362: —_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand
LINE 363: was freed. _E grazie._
LINE 364: —_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said. _Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!_
LINE 365: Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
LINE 366: trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,
LINE 367: signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
LINE 368: implements of music through Trinity gates.
LINE 369: * * *
LINE 370: Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_
LINE 371: far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
LINE 372: typewriter.
LINE 373: Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?
LINE 374: Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.
LINE 375: The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
LINE 376: six.
LINE 377: Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
LINE 378: —16 June 1904.
LINE 379: Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab
LINE 380: where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.
LINE 381: Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.
LINE 382: Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
LINE 383: soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens
LINE 384: and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not
LINE 385: nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt.
LINE 386: Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that
LINE 387: dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out
LINE 388: grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.
LINE 389: Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.
LINE 390: The telephone rang rudely by her ear.
LINE 391: —Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only
LINE 392: those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can
LINE 393: go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven
LINE 394: and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.
LINE 395: She scribbled three figures on an envelope.
LINE 396: —Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.
LINE 397: Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes,
LINE 398: sir. I'll ring them up after five.
LINE 399: * * *
LINE 400: Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.
LINE 401: —Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?
LINE 402: —Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.
LINE 403: —Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
LINE 404: pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps
LINE 405: there.
LINE 406: The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
LINE 407: soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and
LINE 408: mouldy air closed round them.
LINE 409: —How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.
LINE 410: —Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic
LINE 411: council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
LINE 412: himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.
LINE 413: O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.
LINE 414: The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
LINE 415: the original jews' temple was here too before they built their
LINE 416: synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were
LINE 417: you?
LINE 418: —No, Ned.
LINE 419: —He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
LINE 420: serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.
LINE 421: —That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.
LINE 422: —If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to
LINE 423: allow me perhaps...
LINE 424: —Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll
LINE 425: get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here
LINE 426: or from here.
LINE 427: In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the
LINE 428: piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.
LINE 429: From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.
LINE 430: —I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass
LINE 431: on your valuable time...
LINE 432: —You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next
LINE 433: week, say. Can you see?
LINE 434: —Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.
LINE 435: —Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.
LINE 436: He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away
LINE 437: among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's
LINE 438: abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut
LINE 439: meal, O'Connor, Wexford.
LINE 440: He stood to read the card in his hand.
LINE 441: —The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint
LINE 442: Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about
LINE 443: the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.
LINE 444: The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
LINE 445: twig.
LINE 446: —I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.
LINE 447: Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.
LINE 448: —God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
LINE 449: after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? _I'm bloody
LINE 450: sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the
LINE 451: archbishop was inside._ He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll
LINE 452: tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot
LINE 453: members they were all of them, the Geraldines.
LINE 454: The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He
LINE 455: slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
LINE 456: —Woa, sonny!
LINE 457: He turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:
LINE 458: —Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.
LINE 459: With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
LINE 460: instant, sneezed loudly.
LINE 461: —Chow! he said. Blast you!
LINE 462: —The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.
LINE 463: —No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your
LINE 464: soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of
LINE 465: draught...
LINE 466: He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...
LINE 467: —I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call
LINE 468: him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!
LINE 469: * * *
LINE 470: Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
LINE 471: claret waistcoat.
LINE 472: —See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.
LINE 473: He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove,
LINE 474: wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.
LINE 475: Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
LINE 476: consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
LINE 477: the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
LINE 478: admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly
LINE 479: female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
LINE 480: great amplitude.
LINE 481: —See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.
LINE 482: The impact. Leverage, see?
LINE 483: He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.
LINE 484: —Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late
LINE 485: can see what turn is on and what turns are over.
LINE 486: —See? Tom Rochford said.
LINE 487: He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle,
LINE 488: stop: four. Turn Now On.
LINE 489: —I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good
LINE 490: turn deserves another.
LINE 491: —Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.
LINE 492: —Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin...
LINE 493: Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.
LINE 494: —But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.
LINE 495: —Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.
LINE 496: He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.
LINE 497: —He's a hero, he said simply.
LINE 498: —I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.
LINE 499: —Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.
LINE 500: They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
LINE 501: soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.
LINE 502: Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
LINE 503: Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes
LINE 504: like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it,
LINE 505: half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest
LINE 506: and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope
LINE 507: round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.
LINE 508: —The act of a hero, he said.
LINE 509: At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
LINE 510: them for Jervis street.
LINE 511: —This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to
LINE 512: see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and
LINE 513: chain?
LINE 514: M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at
LINE 515: O'Neill's clock.
LINE 516: —After three, he said. Who's riding her?
LINE 517: —O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.
LINE 518: While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
LINE 519: pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy
LINE 520: get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.
LINE 521: The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
LINE 522: cavalcade.
LINE 523: —Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in
LINE 524: there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an
LINE 525: earthly. Through here.
LINE 526: They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure
LINE 527: scanned books on the hawker's cart.
LINE 528: —There he is, Lenehan said.
LINE 529: —Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.
LINE 530: —_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.
LINE 531: —He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he
LINE 532: bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were
LINE 533: fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
LINE 534: comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.
LINE 535: Lenehan laughed.
LINE 536: —I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over
LINE 537: in the sun.
LINE 538: They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
LINE 539: riverwall.
LINE 540: Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's,
LINE 541: carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.
LINE 542: —There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
LINE 543: eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord
LINE 544: mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
LINE 545: Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin
LINE 546: Dollard...
LINE 547: —I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.
LINE 548: —Did she? Lenehan said.
LINE 549: A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number
LINE 550: 7 Eccles street.
LINE 551: He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.
LINE 552: —But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the
LINE 553: catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife
LINE 554: were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and
LINE 555: curacoa to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After
LINE 556: liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...
LINE 557: —I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...
LINE 558: Lenehan linked his arm warmly.
LINE 559: —But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after
LINE 560: all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the
LINE 561: morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's
LINE 562: night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
LINE 563: side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started
LINE 564: singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_. She was well
LINE 565: primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every
LINE 566: jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's
LINE 567: delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.
LINE 568: He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
LINE 569: —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.
LINE 570: Know what I mean?
LINE 571: His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in
LINE 572: delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
LINE 573: —The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey
LINE 574: mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the
LINE 575: comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear
LINE 576: and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I
LINE 577: was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At
LINE 578: last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. _And what star is that,
LINE 579: Poldy?_ says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. _That one, is it?_
LINE 580: says Chris Callinan, _sure that's only what you might call a pinprick._
LINE 581: By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.
LINE 582: Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
LINE 583: laughter.
LINE 584: —I'm weak, he gasped.
LINE 585: M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan
LINE 586: walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
LINE 587: rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.
LINE 588: —He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one
LINE 589: of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist
LINE 590: about old Bloom.
LINE 591: * * *
LINE 592: Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria
LINE 593: Monk_, then of Aristotle's _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.
LINE 594: Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of
LINE 595: slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the
LINE 596: world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every
LINE 597: minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.
LINE 598: He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the
LINE 599: Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
LINE 600: —That I had, he said, pushing it by.
LINE 601: The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.
LINE 602: —Them are two good ones, he said.
LINE 603: Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.
LINE 604: He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
LINE 605: unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.
LINE 606: On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
LINE 607: apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.
LINE 608: Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. _Fair Tyrants_ by James
LINE 609: Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.
LINE 610: He opened it. Thought so.
LINE 611: A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.
LINE 612: No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.
LINE 613: He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_. More in her line. Let us see.
LINE 614: He read where his finger opened.
LINE 615: _—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
LINE 616: wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!_
LINE 617: Yes. This. Here. Try.
LINE 618: —_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
LINE 619: felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._
LINE 620: Yes. Take this. The end.
LINE 621: —You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.
LINE 622: The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
LINE 623: queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played
LINE 624: round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.
LINE 625: Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._
LINE 626: Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply
LINE 627: amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched
LINE 628: themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).
LINE 629: Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).
LINE 630: Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!
LINE 631: Young! Young!
LINE 632: An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
LINE 633: chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the
LINE 634: lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
LINE 635: admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
LINE 636: Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of
LINE 637: appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean
LINE 638: Accident and Guarantee Corporation.
LINE 639: Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
LINE 640: curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
LINE 641: reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on
LINE 642: the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along
LINE 643: it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
LINE 644: Mr Bloom beheld it.
LINE 645: Mastering his troubled breath, he said:
LINE 646: —I'll take this one.
LINE 647: The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.
LINE 648: —_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.
LINE 649: * * *
LINE 650: The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell
LINE 651: twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.
LINE 652: Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell,
LINE 653: the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely
LINE 654: curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas.
LINE 655: Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.
LINE 656: The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
LINE 657: —Barang!
LINE 658: Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.
LINE 659: J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched
LINE 660: necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.
LINE 661: Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row.
LINE 662: He halted near his daughter.
LINE 663: —It's time for you, she said.
LINE 664: —Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are
LINE 665: you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
LINE 666: shoulder? Melancholy God!
LINE 667: Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
LINE 668: held them back.
LINE 669: —Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine.
LINE 670: Do you know what you look like?
LINE 671: He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
LINE 672: and dropping his underjaw.
LINE 673: —Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
LINE 674: Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.
LINE 675: —Did you get any money? Dilly asked.
LINE 676: —Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin
LINE 677: would lend me fourpence.
LINE 678: —You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.
LINE 679: —How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.
LINE 680: Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
LINE 681: James's street.
LINE 682: —I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?
LINE 683: —I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns
LINE 684: taught you to be so saucy? Here.
LINE 685: He handed her a shilling.
LINE 686: —See if you can do anything with that, he said.
LINE 687: —I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.
LINE 688: —Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of
LINE 689: them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor
LINE 690: mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long
LINE 691: day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't
LINE 692: care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.
LINE 693: He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.
LINE 694: —Well, what is it? he said, stopping.
LINE 695: The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.
LINE 696: —Barang!
LINE 697: —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.
LINE 698: The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell
LINE 699: but feebly:
LINE 700: —Bang!
LINE 701: Mr Dedalus stared at him.
LINE 702: —Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to
LINE 703: talk.
LINE 704: —You got more than that, father, Dilly said.
LINE 705: —I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you
LINE 706: all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two
LINE 707: shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
LINE 708: funeral.
LINE 709: He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.
LINE 710: —Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.
LINE 711: Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.
LINE 712: —I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell
LINE 713: street. I'll try this one now.
LINE 714: —You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.
LINE 715: —Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk
LINE 716: for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.
LINE 717: He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.
LINE 718: The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
LINE 719: Parkgate.
LINE 720: —I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.
LINE 721: The lacquey banged loudly.
LINE 722: Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
LINE 723: mincing mouth gently:
LINE 724: —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do
LINE 725: anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!
LINE 726: * * *
LINE 727: From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with
LINE 728: the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's
LINE 729: street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you
LINE 730: do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your
LINE 731: other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping
LINE 732: alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country.
LINE 733: Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your
LINE 734: best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that
LINE 735: _General Slocum_ explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.
LINE 736: And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most
LINE 737: brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion.
LINE 738: Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the
LINE 739: firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever
LINE 740: allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
LINE 741: You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look
LINE 742: at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we
LINE 743: were bad here.
LINE 744: I smiled at him. _America,_ I said quietly, just like that. _What is
LINE 745: it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true?_
LINE 746: That's a fact.
LINE 747: Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's
LINE 748: always someone to pick it up.
LINE 749: Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy
LINE 750: appearance. Bowls them over.
LINE 751: —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
LINE 752: —Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
LINE 753: Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
LINE 754: Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson
LINE 755: street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built
LINE 756: under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street
LINE 757: club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
LINE 758: bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
LINE 759: remembered me.
LINE 760: Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.
LINE 761: Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
LINE 762: again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
LINE 763: has it.
LINE 764: North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains,
LINE 765: sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on
LINE 766: the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.
LINE 767: Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.
LINE 768: Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy
LINE 769: body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned
LINE 770: Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn
LINE 771: it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash
LINE 772: like that. Damn like him.
LINE 773: Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.
LINE 774: Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to
LINE 775: his fat strut.
LINE 776: Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.
LINE 777: Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife
LINE 778: drove by in her noddy.
LINE 779: Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.
LINE 780: Fourbottle men.
LINE 781: Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight
LINE 782: burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the
LINE 783: wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn
LINE 784: down here. Make a detour.
LINE 785: Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the
LINE 786: corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin
LINE 787: Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey
LINE 788: stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some
LINE 789: Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway
LINE 790: horse.
LINE 791: Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John
LINE 792: Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for
LINE 793: the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.
LINE 794: Mr Kernan approached Island street.
LINE 795: Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those
LINE 796: reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now
LINE 797: in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No
LINE 798: cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the
LINE 799: table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from
LINE 800: major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.
LINE 801: Damn good gin that was.
LINE 802: Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that
LINE 803: sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on
LINE 804: the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is:
LINE 805: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad
LINE 806: touchingly. Masterly rendition.
LINE 807: _At the siege of Ross did my father fall._
LINE 808: A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,
LINE 809: leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.
LINE 810: Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.
LINE 811: His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a
LINE 812: pity!
LINE 813: * * *
LINE 814: Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's
LINE 815: fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the
LINE 816: showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.
LINE 817: Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on
LINE 818: rubies, leprous and winedark stones.
LINE 819: Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights
LINE 820: shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of
LINE 821: their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest
LINE 822: them.
LINE 823: She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,
LINE 824: rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed
LINE 825: silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her
LINE 826: hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.
LINE 827: Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned
LINE 828: it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape
LINE 829: gloating on a stolen hoard.
LINE 830: And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words
LINE 831: of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat
LINE 832: standing from everlasting to everlasting.
LINE 833: Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through
LINE 834: Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,
LINE 835: one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.
LINE 836: The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
LINE 837: powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always
LINE 838: without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I
LINE 839: between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.
LINE 840: Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me
LINE 841: you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A
LINE 842: look around.
LINE 843: Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You
LINE 844: say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.
LINE 845: Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against
LINE 846: his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan
LINE 847: boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood
LINE 848: round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths
LINE 849: proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are
LINE 850: throbbing: heroes' hearts.
LINE 851: He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.
LINE 852: —Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.
LINE 853: Tattered pages. _The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curé of
LINE 854: Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney._
LINE 855: I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. _Stephano Dedalo,
LINE 856: alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._
LINE 857: Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet
LINE 858: of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.
LINE 859: Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of
LINE 860: Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read
LINE 861: and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands.
LINE 862: Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this.
LINE 863: Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:
LINE 864: —_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._
LINE 865: Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter
LINE 866: Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's
LINE 867: charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your
LINE 868: wool.
LINE 869: —What are you doing here, Stephen?
LINE 870: Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.
LINE 871: Shut the book quick. Don't let see.
LINE 872: —What are you doing? Stephen said.
LINE 873: A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It
LINE 874: glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her
LINE 875: of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a
LINE 876: pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. _Nebrakada femininum._
LINE 877: —What have you there? Stephen asked.
LINE 878: —I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
LINE 879: nervously. Is it any good?
LINE 880: My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.
LINE 881: Shadow of my mind.
LINE 882: He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.
LINE 883: —What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?
LINE 884: She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
LINE 885: Show no surprise. Quite natural.
LINE 886: —Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you.
LINE 887: I suppose all my books are gone.
LINE 888: —Some, Dilly said. We had to.
LINE 889: She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will
LINE 890: drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,
LINE 891: my heart, my soul. Salt green death.
LINE 892: We.
LINE 893: Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.
LINE 894: Misery! Misery!
LINE 895: * * *
LINE 896: —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
LINE 897: —Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
LINE 898: They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley
LINE 899: brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
LINE 900: —What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.
LINE 901: —Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with
LINE 902: two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
LINE 903: —Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?
LINE 904: —O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
LINE 905: —With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.
LINE 906: —The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just
LINE 907: waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get
LINE 908: him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
LINE 909: He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
LINE 910: his neck.
LINE 911: —I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always
LINE 912: doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!
LINE 913: He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
LINE 914: —There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
LINE 915: Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
LINE 916: crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards
LINE 917: them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
LINE 918: As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
LINE 919: —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
LINE 920: —Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
LINE 921: Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
LINE 922: Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he
LINE 923: muttered sneeringly:
LINE 924: —That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?
LINE 925: —Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
LINE 926: threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
LINE 927: He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
LINE 928: from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
LINE 929: —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
LINE 930: —Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to
LINE 931: God he's not paid yet.
LINE 932: —And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.
LINE 933: Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
LINE 934: glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.
LINE 935: Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth
LINE 936: a deep note.
LINE 937: —Aw! he said.
LINE 938: —That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
LINE 939: —What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?
LINE 940: He turned to both.
LINE 941: —That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
LINE 942: The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
LINE 943: Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by
LINE 944: Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
LINE 945: hurdles.
LINE 946: Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
LINE 947: his joyful fingers in the air.
LINE 948: —Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show
LINE 949: you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between
LINE 950: Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.
LINE 951: I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will
LINE 952: cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay,
LINE 953: Bob, believe you me.
LINE 954: —For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
LINE 955: Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
LINE 956: of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
LINE 957: heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
LINE 958: —What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?
LINE 959: —He has, Father Cowley said.
LINE 960: —Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben
LINE 961: Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the
LINE 962: particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?
LINE 963: —That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a
LINE 964: minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?
LINE 965: —You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
LINE 966: writ where Jacko put the nuts.
LINE 967: He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.
LINE 968: —Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
LINE 969: glasses on his coatfront, following them.
LINE 970: * * *
LINE 971: —The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
LINE 972: passed out of the Castleyard gate.
LINE 973: The policeman touched his forehead.
LINE 974: —God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.
LINE 975: He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
LINE 976: towards Lord Edward street.
LINE 977: Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared
LINE 978: above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.
LINE 979: —Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father
LINE 980: Conmee and laid the whole case before him.
LINE 981: —You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.
LINE 982: —Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.
LINE 983: John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
LINE 984: quickly down Cork hill.
LINE 985: On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
LINE 986: Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.
LINE 987: The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.
LINE 988: —Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
LINE 989: office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
LINE 990: —Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the
LINE 991: five shillings too.
LINE 992: —Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
LINE 993: —Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
LINE 994: John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.
LINE 995: —I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.
LINE 996: They went down Parliament street.
LINE 997: —There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.
LINE 998: —Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.
LINE 999: Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's
LINE 1000: brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.
LINE 1001: John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
LINE 1002: the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
LINE 1003: uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.
LINE 1004: —The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John
LINE 1005: Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.
LINE 1006: They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The
LINE 1007: empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,
LINE 1008: speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
LINE 1009: glance.
LINE 1010: —And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
LINE 1011: life.
LINE 1012: The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
LINE 1013: —Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
LINE 1014: greeted.
LINE 1015: Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay
LINE 1016: decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
LINE 1017: their faces.
LINE 1018: —Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
LINE 1019: said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
LINE 1020: Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
LINE 1021: about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to
LINE 1022: know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the
LINE 1023: macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
LINE 1024: no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
LINE 1025: Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him. Damned Irish language,
LINE 1026: language of our forefathers.
LINE 1027: Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.
LINE 1028: Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to
LINE 1029: the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held
LINE 1030: his peace.
LINE 1031: —What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.
LINE 1032: Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
LINE 1033: —O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake
LINE 1034: till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!
LINE 1035: Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and
LINE 1036: passed in and up the stairs.
LINE 1037: —Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think
LINE 1038: you knew him or perhaps you did, though.
LINE 1039: With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
LINE 1040: —Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
LINE 1041: John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.
LINE 1042: —Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham
LINE 1043: said.
LINE 1044: Long John Fanning could not remember him.
LINE 1045: Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
LINE 1046: —What's that? Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 1047: All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the
LINE 1048: cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
LINE 1049: harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went
LINE 1050: past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the
LINE 1051: leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.
LINE 1052: —What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
LINE 1053: staircase.
LINE 1054: —The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
LINE 1055: Nolan answered from the stairfoot.
LINE 1056: * * *
LINE 1057: As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
LINE 1058: Panama to Haines:
LINE 1059: —Parnell's brother. There in the corner.
LINE 1060: They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
LINE 1061: whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
LINE 1062: —Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
LINE 1063: —Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
LINE 1064: John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
LINE 1065: went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after,
LINE 1066: under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and
LINE 1067: fell once more upon a working corner.
LINE 1068: —I'll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.
LINE 1069: —Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and
LINE 1070: butter and some cakes as well.
LINE 1071: When she had gone he said, laughing:
LINE 1072: —We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed
LINE 1073: Dedalus on _Hamlet._
LINE 1074: Haines opened his newbought book.
LINE 1075: —I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
LINE 1076: minds that have lost their balance.
LINE 1077: The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
LINE 1078: —_England expects_...
LINE 1079: Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
LINE 1080: —You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.
LINE 1081: Wandering Ængus I call him.
LINE 1082: —I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin
LINE 1083: thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it
LINE 1084: would be likely to be. Such persons always have.
LINE 1085: Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
LINE 1086: —They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never
LINE 1087: capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
LINE 1088: death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.
LINE 1089: The joy of creation...
LINE 1090: —Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him
LINE 1091: this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's
LINE 1092: rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
LINE 1093: interesting point out of that.
LINE 1094: Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to
LINE 1095: unload her tray.
LINE 1096: —He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
LINE 1097: the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
LINE 1098: of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.
LINE 1099: Does he write anything for your movement?
LINE 1100: He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
LINE 1101: Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over
LINE 1102: its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
LINE 1103: —Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write
LINE 1104: something in ten years.
LINE 1105: —Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
LINE 1106: Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.
LINE 1107: He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
LINE 1108: —This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't
LINE 1109: want to be imposed on.
LINE 1110: Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
LINE 1111: ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
LINE 1112: street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_
LINE 1113: from Bridgwater with bricks.
LINE 1114: * * *
LINE 1115: Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind
LINE 1116: him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
LINE 1117: stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's
LINE 1118: house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him
LINE 1119: a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.
LINE 1120: Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr
LINE 1121: Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
LINE 1122: Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
LINE 1123: At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name
LINE 1124: announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
LINE 1125: duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth
LINE 1126: bared he muttered:
LINE 1127: —_Coactus volui._
LINE 1128: He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.
LINE 1129: As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
LINE 1130: brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
LINE 1131: having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly
LINE 1132: face after the striding form.
LINE 1133: —God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder
LINE 1134: nor I am, you bitch's bastard!
LINE 1135: * * *
LINE 1136: Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
LINE 1137: pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been
LINE 1138: sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming
LINE 1139: dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
LINE 1140: MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
LINE 1141: sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's.
LINE 1142: And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
LINE 1143: blooming time and sighing.
LINE 1144: After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
LINE 1145: stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
LINE 1146: pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning
LINE 1147: Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will
LINE 1148: meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of
LINE 1149: fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler
LINE 1150: Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar
LINE 1151: entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master
LINE 1152: Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is
LINE 1153: it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He
LINE 1154: turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap
LINE 1155: awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he
LINE 1156: saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two
LINE 1157: puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer
LINE 1158: smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found
LINE 1159: out.
LINE 1160: Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going
LINE 1161: for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow
LINE 1162: would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker
LINE 1163: for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out
LINE 1164: of him, dodging and all.
LINE 1165: In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and
LINE 1166: a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
LINE 1167: telling him and grinning all the time.
LINE 1168: No Sandymount tram.
LINE 1169: Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his
LINE 1170: other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The
LINE 1171: blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
LINE 1172: end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow
LINE 1173: either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice
LINE 1174: I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight.
LINE 1175: Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's
LINE 1176: name.
LINE 1177: His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
LINE 1178: fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were
LINE 1179: screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were
LINE 1180: bringing it downstairs.
LINE 1181: Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
LINE 1182: the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
LINE 1183: heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was
LINE 1184: standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to
LINE 1185: Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.
LINE 1186: Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He
LINE 1187: told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he
LINE 1188: said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor
LINE 1189: pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because
LINE 1190: he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.
LINE 1191: * * *
LINE 1192: William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by
LINE 1193: lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the
LINE 1194: viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs
LINE 1195: Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. in
LINE 1196: attendance.
LINE 1197: The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by
LINE 1198: obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern
LINE 1199: quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the
LINE 1200: metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
LINE 1201: him vainly from afar. Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord
LINE 1202: Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley
LINE 1203: White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's,
LINE 1204: the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose
LINE 1205: with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
LINE 1206: more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
LINE 1207: through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the
LINE 1208: porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,
LINE 1209: Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the
LINE 1210: doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the
LINE 1211: Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed
LINE 1212: her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously
LINE 1213: on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall
LINE 1214: under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of
LINE 1215: liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by
LINE 1216: bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired.
LINE 1217: On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse
LINE 1218: for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his
LINE 1219: hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From
LINE 1220: Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M. A., made obeisance
LINE 1221: unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held
LINE 1222: of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking
LINE 1223: leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger
LINE 1224: Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell,
LINE 1225: carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid
LINE 1226: up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she
LINE 1227: couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's
LINE 1228: big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its
LINE 1229: being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of
LINE 1230: Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness
LINE 1231: towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The
LINE 1232: Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed
LINE 1233: Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax
LINE 1234: smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, _dernier cri_
LINE 1235: James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the
LINE 1236: approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley
LINE 1237: fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret
LINE 1238: waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming _soubrette,_ great
LINE 1239: Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from
LINE 1240: her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon
LINE 1241: lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald
LINE 1242: Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and
LINE 1243: Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders
LINE 1244: of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon
LINE 1245: John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus,
LINE 1246: straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw
LINE 1247: sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry
LINE 1248: Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from
LINE 1249: winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in
LINE 1250: his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's
LINE 1251: horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from
LINE 1252: under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings.
LINE 1253: Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the
LINE 1254: second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably
LINE 1255: surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white
LINE 1256: flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him,
LINE 1257: E.L.Y.'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's
LINE 1258: music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily
LINE 1259: apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By
LINE 1260: the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes
LINE 1261: and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of _My girl's a Yorkshire
LINE 1262: girl._
LINE 1263: Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high
LINE 1264: action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a
LINE 1265: suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute
LINE 1266: but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and
LINE 1267: the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His
LINE 1268: Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of
LINE 1269: music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen
LINE 1270: highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the _cortège_:
LINE 1271: But though she's a factory lass
LINE 1272: And wears no fancy clothes.
LINE 1273: Baraabum.
LINE 1274: Yet I've a sort of a
LINE 1275: Yorkshire relish for
LINE 1276: My little Yorkshire rose.
LINE 1277: Baraabum.
LINE 1278: Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.
LINE 1279: Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F.
LINE 1280: Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding
LINE 1281: past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell
LINE 1282: stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr
LINE 1283: M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate.
LINE 1284: Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man,
LINE 1285: Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by
LINE 1286: Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes
LINE 1287: being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black
LINE 1288: cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up.
LINE 1289: The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds
LINE 1290: for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount
LINE 1291: street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower
LINE 1292: Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread,
LINE 1293: passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal
LINE 1294: Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips
LINE 1295: agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road
LINE 1296: corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in
LINE 1297: which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady
LINE 1298: mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne
LINE 1299: roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male
LINE 1300: walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the
LINE 1301: house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the
LINE 1302: Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the
LINE 1303: salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing
LINE 1304: door.
