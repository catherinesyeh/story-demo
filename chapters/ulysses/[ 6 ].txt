LINE 1: Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
LINE 2: carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in
LINE 3: after him, curving his height with care.
LINE 4: —Come on, Simon.
LINE 5: —After you, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 6: Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
LINE 7: —Yes, yes.
LINE 8: —Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
LINE 9: Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to
LINE 10: after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm
LINE 11: through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
LINE 12: at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman
LINE 13: peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she
LINE 14: was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad
LINE 15: to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
LINE 16: Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd
LINE 17: wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming
LINE 18: making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know
LINE 19: who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the
LINE 20: nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same
LINE 21: after. Unclean job.
LINE 22: All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
LINE 23: sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better
LINE 24: shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
LINE 25: All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
LINE 26: then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
LINE 27: swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of
LINE 28: the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.
LINE 29: At walking pace.
LINE 30: They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
LINE 31: passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels
LINE 32: rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
LINE 33: rattling in the doorframes.
LINE 34: —What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
LINE 35: —Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
LINE 36: Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
LINE 37: —That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
LINE 38: out.
LINE 39: All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
LINE 40: passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
LINE 41: smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
LINE 42: clad in mourning, a wide hat.
LINE 43: —There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
LINE 44: —Who is that?
LINE 45: —Your son and heir.
LINE 46: —Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
LINE 47: The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
LINE 48: before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
LINE 49: to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus
LINE 50: fell back, saying:
LINE 51: —Was that Mulligan cad with him? His _fidus Achates_!
LINE 52: —No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
LINE 53: —Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
LINE 54: faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump
LINE 55: of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
LINE 56: Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the
LINE 57: bottleworks: Dodder bridge.
LINE 58: Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
LINE 59: the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing
LINE 60: in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
LINE 61: landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.
LINE 62: Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife
LINE 63: ironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they
LINE 64: are. About six hundred per cent profit.
LINE 65: —He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a
LINE 66: contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks
LINE 67: all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll
LINE 68: make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
LINE 69: or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
LINE 70: gate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
LINE 71: He cried above the clatter of the wheels:
LINE 72: —I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's
LINE 73: son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.
LINE 74: He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild
LINE 75: face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
LINE 76: selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
LINE 77: little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
LINE 78: Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
LINE 79: feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that
LINE 80: morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
LINE 81: at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning
LINE 82: up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us
LINE 83: a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.
LINE 84: Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.
LINE 85: I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent.
LINE 86: Learn German too.
LINE 87: —Are we late? Mr Power asked.
LINE 88: —Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
LINE 89: Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
LINE 90: Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a
LINE 91: woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
LINE 92: Life, life.
LINE 93: The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
LINE 94: —Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
LINE 95: —He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do
LINE 96: you follow me?
LINE 97: He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away
LINE 98: crustcrumbs from under his thighs.
LINE 99: —What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
LINE 100: —Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
LINE 101: said.
LINE 102: All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
LINE 103: leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
LINE 104: and said:
LINE 105: —Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
LINE 106: —It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 107: Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
LINE 108: clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
LINE 109: Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
LINE 110: —After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.
LINE 111: —Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
LINE 112: his beard gently.
LINE 113: —Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
LINE 114: —And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
LINE 115: —At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 116: —I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.
LINE 117: The carriage halted short.
LINE 118: —What's wrong?
LINE 119: —We're stopped.
LINE 120: —Where are we?
LINE 121: Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.
LINE 122: —The grand canal, he said.
LINE 123: Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got
LINE 124: it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame
LINE 125: really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed
LINE 126: tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss
LINE 127: this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
LINE 128: Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.
LINE 129: A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's
LINE 130: dogs usually are.
LINE 131: A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower
LINE 132: spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a
LINE 133: colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
LINE 134: —The weather is changing, he said quietly.
LINE 135: —A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 136: —Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming
LINE 137: out.
LINE 138: Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled
LINE 139: a mute curse at the sky.
LINE 140: —It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.
LINE 141: —We're off again.
LINE 142: The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
LINE 143: gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
LINE 144: —Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking
LINE 145: him off to his face.
LINE 146: —O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear
LINE 147: him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of _The Croppy Boy_.
LINE 148: —Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. _His singing of that simple
LINE 149: ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
LINE 150: whole course of my experience._
LINE 151: —Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the
LINE 152: retrospective arrangement.
LINE 153: —Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
LINE 154: —I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
LINE 155: —In the paper this morning.
LINE 156: Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
LINE 157: for her.
LINE 158: —No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
LINE 159: Mr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
LINE 160: deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
LINE 161: Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton,
LINE 162: Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
LINE 163: Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief
LINE 164: of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind:
LINE 165: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
LINE 166: It is now a month since dear Henry fled
LINE 167: To his home up above in the sky
LINE 168: While his family weeps and mourns his loss
LINE 169: Hoping some day to meet him on high.
LINE 170: I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it
LINE 171: in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry
LINE 172: fled. Before my patience are exhausted.
LINE 173: National school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
LINE 174: Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round
LINE 175: with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their
LINE 176: hats.
LINE 177: A pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
LINE 178: tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something
LINE 179: automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow
LINE 180: would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job
LINE 181: making the new invention?
LINE 182: Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a
LINE 183: crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law
LINE 184: perhaps.
LINE 185: They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway
LINE 186: bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene
LINE 187: Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I
LINE 188: wonder. I said I. Or the _Lily of Killarney_? Elster Grimes Opera
LINE 189: Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. _Fun on
LINE 190: the Bristol_. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have
LINE 191: to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.
LINE 192: He's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
LINE 193: Plasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?
LINE 194: —How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
LINE 195: salute.
LINE 196: —He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
LINE 197: —Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
LINE 198: —Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
LINE 199: Just that moment I was thinking.
LINE 200: Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the
LINE 201: white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.
LINE 202: Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
LINE 203: hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
LINE 204: Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
LINE 205: feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am
LINE 206: just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
LINE 207: getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
LINE 208: that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh
LINE 209: falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.
LINE 210: Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the
LINE 211: cheeks behind.
LINE 212: He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
LINE 213: glance over their faces.
LINE 214: Mr Power asked:
LINE 215: —How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
LINE 216: —O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good
LINE 217: idea, you see...
LINE 218: —Are you going yourself?
LINE 219: —Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
LINE 220: county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
LINE 221: chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
LINE 222: —Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
LINE 223: Have you good artists?
LINE 224: —Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all
LINE 225: topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in
LINE 226: fact.
LINE 227: —And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
LINE 228: Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and
LINE 229: clasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.
LINE 230: Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage
LINE 231: wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting
LINE 232: knees.
LINE 233: Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
LINE 234: mouth opening: oot.
LINE 235: —Four bootlaces for a penny.
LINE 236: Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.
LINE 237: Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.
LINE 238: Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.
LINE 239: Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.
LINE 240: O'Callaghan on his last legs.
LINE 241: And _Madame_. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing
LINE 242: her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_. No: _vorrei e non_. Looking
LINE 243: at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. _Mi trema un poco
LINE 244: il_. Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A
LINE 245: throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.
LINE 246: His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over
LINE 247: the ears. _Madame_: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way.
LINE 248: Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the
LINE 249: woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it
LINE 250: told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played
LINE 251: out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her
LINE 252: a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the
LINE 253: Moira, was it?
LINE 254: They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.
LINE 255: Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
LINE 256: —Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
LINE 257: A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
LINE 258: of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his
LINE 259: spine.
LINE 260: —In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
LINE 261: Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
LINE 262: —The devil break the hasp of your back!
LINE 263: Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as
LINE 264: the carriage passed Gray's statue.
LINE 265: —We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
LINE 266: His eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
LINE 267: —Well, nearly all of us.
LINE 268: Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.
LINE 269: —That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and
LINE 270: the son.
LINE 271: —About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
LINE 272: —Yes. Isn't it awfully good?
LINE 273: —What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.
LINE 274: —There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
LINE 275: send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were
LINE 276: both.....
LINE 277: —What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
LINE 278: —Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
LINE 279: to drown.....
LINE 280: —Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
LINE 281: Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
LINE 282: —No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....
LINE 283: Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
LINE 284: —Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
LINE 285: their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
LINE 286: loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
LINE 287: —For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
LINE 288: —Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
LINE 289: him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
LINE 290: on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
LINE 291: —Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....
LINE 292: —And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
LINE 293: saving his son's life.
LINE 294: A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.
LINE 295: —O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
LINE 296: —Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
LINE 297: —One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
LINE 298: Mr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
LINE 299: Nelson's pillar.
LINE 300: —Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
LINE 301: —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 302: Mr Dedalus sighed.
LINE 303: —Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh.
LINE 304: Many a good one he told himself.
LINE 305: —The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
LINE 306: fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
LINE 307: and he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this.
LINE 308: He's gone from us.
LINE 309: —As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
LINE 310: very suddenly.
LINE 311: —Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
LINE 312: He tapped his chest sadly.
LINE 313: Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.
LINE 314: Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent
LINE 315: colouring it.
LINE 316: Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
LINE 317: —He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
LINE 318: —The best death, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 319: Their wide open eyes looked at him.
LINE 320: —No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
LINE 321: No-one spoke.
LINE 322: Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,
LINE 323: temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college,
LINE 324: Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or
LINE 325: wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the
LINE 326: late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.
LINE 327: White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
LINE 328: galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning
LINE 329: coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for
LINE 330: a nun.
LINE 331: —Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
LINE 332: A dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's
LINE 333: body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society
LINE 334: pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant
LINE 335: nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If
LINE 336: not from the man. Better luck next time.
LINE 337: —Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.
LINE 338: The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
LINE 339: bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
LINE 340: —In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 341: —But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own
LINE 342: life.
LINE 343: Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
LINE 344: —The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
LINE 345: —Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We
LINE 346: must take a charitable view of it.
LINE 347: —They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
LINE 348: —It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 349: Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's
LINE 350: large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.
LINE 351: Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy
LINE 352: on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to
LINE 353: drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't
LINE 354: broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the
LINE 355: riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of
LINE 356: a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then
LINE 357: pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the
LINE 358: life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday
LINE 359: morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have
LINE 360: looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about
LINE 361: the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.
LINE 362: And they call me the jewel of Asia,
LINE 363: Of Asia,
LINE 364: The geisha.
LINE 365: He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
LINE 366: That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The
LINE 367: room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight
LINE 368: through the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big
LINE 369: and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw
LINE 370: like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the
LINE 371: bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son
LINE 372: Leopold.
LINE 373: No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
LINE 374: The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
LINE 375: —We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 376: —God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
LINE 377: —I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow
LINE 378: in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
LINE 379: —Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
LINE 380: As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
LINE 381: over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has
LINE 382: anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from _Saul._
LINE 383: He's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The
LINE 384: _Mater Misericordiae_. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place.
LINE 385: Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the
LINE 386: dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They
LINE 387: look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
LINE 388: spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student
LINE 389: that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the
LINE 390: lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.
LINE 391: The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.
LINE 392: —What's wrong now?
LINE 393: A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
LINE 394: by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
LINE 395: croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
LINE 396: fear.
LINE 397: —Emigrants, Mr Power said.
LINE 398: —Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
LINE 399: Huuuh! out of that!
LINE 400: Thursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold
LINE 401: them about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for
LINE 402: old England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter
LINE 403: lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a
LINE 404: year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
LINE 405: soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
LINE 406: the train at Clonsilla.
LINE 407: The carriage moved on through the drove.
LINE 408: —I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the
LINE 409: parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken
LINE 410: in trucks down to the boats.
LINE 411: —Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite
LINE 412: right. They ought to.
LINE 413: —Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
LINE 414: municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
LINE 415: out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
LINE 416: and all. Don't you see what I mean?
LINE 417: —O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon
LINE 418: diningroom.
LINE 419: —A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
LINE 420: —Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent
LINE 421: than galloping two abreast?
LINE 422: —Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
LINE 423: —And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when
LINE 424: the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.
LINE 425: —That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell
LINE 426: about the road. Terrible!
LINE 427: —First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
LINE 428: —Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
LINE 429: Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy
LINE 430: Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too
LINE 431: large for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up
LINE 432: now. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides
LINE 433: decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also.
LINE 434: With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.
LINE 435: —Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
LINE 436: Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A
LINE 437: pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up
LINE 438: here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.
LINE 439: Elixir of life.
LINE 440: But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in
LINE 441: the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on
LINE 442: where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery.
LINE 443: It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.
LINE 444: In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted
LINE 445: by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
LINE 446: Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.
LINE 447: Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping
LINE 448: barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a
LINE 449: slacktethered horse. Aboard of the _Bugabu._
LINE 450: Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on
LINE 451: his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
LINE 452: reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,
LINE 453: Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or
LINE 454: cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at
LINE 455: the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to
LINE 456: row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.
LINE 457: Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without
LINE 458: writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by
LINE 459: lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his
LINE 460: brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.
LINE 461: They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.
LINE 462: —I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
LINE 463: —Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
LINE 464: —How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
LINE 465: —Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
LINE 466: The carriage steered left for Finglas road.
LINE 467: The stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
LINE 468: land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
LINE 469: knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:
LINE 470: appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder
LINE 471: and sculptor.
LINE 472: Passed.
LINE 473: On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat,
LINE 474: grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
LINE 475: yawning boot. After life's journey.
LINE 476: Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
LINE 477: Mr Power pointed.
LINE 478: —That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
LINE 479: —So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.
LINE 480: Murdered his brother. Or so they said.
LINE 481: —The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
LINE 482: —Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the
LINE 483: law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent
LINE 484: person to be wrongfully condemned.
LINE 485: They looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered,
LINE 486: tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully
LINE 487: condemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered.
LINE 488: They love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing
LINE 489: consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used.
LINE 490: Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed.
LINE 491: Murder will out.
LINE 492: Cramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without
LINE 493: letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with
LINE 494: their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
LINE 495: The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,
LINE 496: rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
LINE 497: trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
LINE 498: gestures on the air.
LINE 499: The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
LINE 500: out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
LINE 501: his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
LINE 502: Change that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
LINE 503: and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
LINE 504: He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
LINE 505: still held.
LINE 506: Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same.
LINE 507: Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.
LINE 508: Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
LINE 509: fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
LINE 510: Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
LINE 511: He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
LINE 512: walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
LINE 513: out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
LINE 514: Where is that child's funeral disappeared to?
LINE 515: A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
LINE 516: dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
LINE 517: granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
LINE 518: Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at
LINE 519: it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck,
LINE 520: pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out
LINE 521: here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount
LINE 522: Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere
LINE 523: every minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.
LINE 524: Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.
LINE 525: Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
LINE 526: hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt
LINE 527: and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to
LINE 528: cry. Fish's face, bloodless and livid.
LINE 529: The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So
LINE 530: much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First
LINE 531: the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy
LINE 532: followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the
LINE 533: brother-in-law.
LINE 534: All walked after.
LINE 535: Martin Cunningham whispered:
LINE 536: —I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
LINE 537: —What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
LINE 538: —His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
LINE 539: Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.
LINE 540: Anniversary.
LINE 541: —O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
LINE 542: He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
LINE 543: towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.
LINE 544: —Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
LINE 545: —I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily
LINE 546: mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
LINE 547: —How many children did he leave?
LINE 548: —Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.
LINE 549: —A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
LINE 550: —A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
LINE 551: —Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
LINE 552: Has the laugh at him now.
LINE 553: He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had
LINE 554: outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must
LINE 555: outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the
LINE 556: world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow
LINE 557: him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who
LINE 558: knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on
LINE 559: a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in
LINE 560: the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of
LINE 561: hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the
LINE 562: substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
LINE 563: waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground:
LINE 564: and lie no more in her warm bed.
LINE 565: —How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't
LINE 566: seen you for a month of Sundays.
LINE 567: —Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?
LINE 568: —I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
LINE 569: said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
LINE 570: —And how is Dick, the solid man?
LINE 571: —Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
LINE 572: —By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
LINE 573: —Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
LINE 574: pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
LINE 575: insurance is cleared up.
LINE 576: —Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
LINE 577: —Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is
LINE 578: behind. He put down his name for a quid.
LINE 579: —I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought
LINE 580: to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
LINE 581: —How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
LINE 582: —Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
LINE 583: They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood
LINE 584: behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and
LINE 585: at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was
LINE 586: he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last
LINE 587: moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe
LINE 588: three shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the
LINE 589: coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?
LINE 590: After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
LINE 591: light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
LINE 592: candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a
LINE 593: wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
LINE 594: knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the
LINE 595: font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
LINE 596: from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
LINE 597: hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
LINE 598: A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
LINE 599: door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with
LINE 600: one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's
LINE 601: belly. Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.
LINE 602: They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
LINE 603: with a fluent croak.
LINE 604: Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. _Dominenamine._ Bully
LINE 605: about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe
LINE 606: betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst
LINE 607: sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on
LINE 608: him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:
LINE 609: burst sideways.
LINE 610: _—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._
LINE 611: Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem
LINE 612: mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist.
LINE 613: Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning
LINE 614: in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a
LINE 615: toad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after
LINE 616: cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an
LINE 617: infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they
LINE 618: get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the
LINE 619: vaults of saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have
LINE 620: to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn
LINE 621: it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.
LINE 622: My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.
LINE 623: The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's
LINE 624: bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end
LINE 625: and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As
LINE 626: you were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.
LINE 627: _—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._
LINE 628: The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
LINE 629: better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course
LINE 630: ...
LINE 631: Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed
LINE 632: up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
LINE 633: What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day
LINE 634: a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
LINE 635: childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
LINE 636: with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same
LINE 637: thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam
LINE 638: now.
LINE 639: _—In paradisum._
LINE 640: Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over
LINE 641: everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
LINE 642: The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
LINE 643: Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
LINE 644: coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny
LINE 645: Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All
LINE 646: followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom
LINE 647: came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at
LINE 648: the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal
LINE 649: wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt
LINE 650: boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
LINE 651: The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.
LINE 652: —The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
LINE 653: Mr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.
LINE 654: —He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But
LINE 655: his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here,
LINE 656: Simon!
LINE 657: —Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched
LINE 658: beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
LINE 659: Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
LINE 660: in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
LINE 661: —She's better where she is, he said kindly.
LINE 662: —I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
LINE 663: heaven if there is a heaven.
LINE 664: Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
LINE 665: plod by.
LINE 666: —Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
LINE 667: Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
LINE 668: —The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can
LINE 669: do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
LINE 670: They covered their heads.
LINE 671: —The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think?
LINE 672: Mr Kernan said with reproof.
LINE 673: Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret
LINE 674: eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We
LINE 675: are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.
LINE 676: Mr Kernan added:
LINE 677: —The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
LINE 678: impressive I must say.
LINE 679: Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
LINE 680: Mr Kernan said with solemnity:
LINE 681: —_I am the resurrection and the life_. That touches a man's inmost
LINE 682: heart.
LINE 683: —It does, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 684: Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
LINE 685: with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.
LINE 686: Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
LINE 687: every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of
LINE 688: them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn
LINE 689: the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you
LINE 690: are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves.
LINE 691: Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last
LINE 692: day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and
LINE 693: the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning.
LINE 694: Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy
LINE 695: measure.
LINE 696: Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
LINE 697: —Everything went off A1, he said. What?
LINE 698: He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With
LINE 699: your tooraloom tooraloom.
LINE 700: —As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
LINE 701: —What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
LINE 702: Mr Kernan assured him.
LINE 703: —Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
LINE 704: know his face.
LINE 705: Ned Lambert glanced back.
LINE 706: —Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the
LINE 707: soprano. She's his wife.
LINE 708: —O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some
LINE 709: time. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen
LINE 710: seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good
LINE 711: armful she was.
LINE 712: He looked behind through the others.
LINE 713: —What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery
LINE 714: line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
LINE 715: Ned Lambert smiled.
LINE 716: —Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.
LINE 717: —In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
LINE 718: that for? She had plenty of game in her then.
LINE 719: —Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
LINE 720: John Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.
LINE 721: The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
LINE 722: grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
LINE 723: —John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
LINE 724: Mr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
LINE 725: —I am come to pay you another visit.
LINE 726: —My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want
LINE 727: your custom at all.
LINE 728: Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
LINE 729: Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.
LINE 730: —Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?
LINE 731: —I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 732: They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
LINE 733: caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
LINE 734: in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
LINE 735: —They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
LINE 736: evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
LINE 737: Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After
LINE 738: traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the
LINE 739: drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was
LINE 740: blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
LINE 741: The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He
LINE 742: resumed:
LINE 743: —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
LINE 744: the man_, says he. _That's not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.
LINE 745: Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
LINE 746: accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
LINE 747: he walked.
LINE 748: —That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.
LINE 749: —I know, Hynes said. I know that.
LINE 750: —To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure
LINE 751: goodheartedness: damn the thing else.
LINE 752: Mr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on
LINE 753: good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort.
LINE 754: Keys: like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout
LINE 755: checks. _Habeas corpus_. I must see about that ad after the funeral.
LINE 756: Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she
LINE 757: disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead
LINE 758: letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's
LINE 759: the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross.
LINE 760: Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the
LINE 761: gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard.
LINE 762: Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death.
LINE 763: Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The
LINE 764: shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be
LINE 765: a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
LINE 766: man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o'
LINE 767: the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
LINE 768: all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to
LINE 769: make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a
LINE 770: pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd
LINE 771: kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards.
LINE 772: Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here.
LINE 773: Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In
LINE 774: the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the
LINE 775: poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their
LINE 776: vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window.
LINE 777: Eight children he has anyway.
LINE 778: He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
LINE 779: after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.
LINE 780: Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some
LINE 781: day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed
LINE 782: the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim
LINE 783: grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so
LINE 784: it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant
LINE 785: poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic
LINE 786: Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives
LINE 787: new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.
LINE 788: Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure,
LINE 789: invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William
LINE 790: Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds
LINE 791: thirteen and six. With thanks.
LINE 792: I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
LINE 793: nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
LINE 794: quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a
LINE 795: tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing
LINE 796: out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever
LINE 797: they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically.
LINE 798: Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.
LINE 799: But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply
LINE 800: swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little
LINE 801: seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of
LINE 802: power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at
LINE 803: life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one
LINE 804: about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11
LINE 805: p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the
LINE 806: men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's
LINE 807: in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep
LINE 808: out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.
LINE 809: Gravediggers in _Hamlet_. Shows the profound knowledge of the human
LINE 810: heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. _De mortuis
LINE 811: nil nisi prius_. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral.
LINE 812: Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live
LINE 813: longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.
LINE 814: —How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
LINE 815: —Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
LINE 816: The caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
LINE 817: trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole,
LINE 818: stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin
LINE 819: and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
LINE 820: Burying him. We come to bury Cæsar. His ides of March or June. He
LINE 821: doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot
LINE 822: over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd
LINE 823: give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
LINE 824: dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
LINE 825: could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though
LINE 826: he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too.
LINE 827: First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was
LINE 828: true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a
LINE 829: Thursday if you come to look at it.
LINE 830: O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
LINE 831: How could you possibly do so?
LINE 832: Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of
LINE 833: them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could
LINE 834: invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
LINE 835: way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's.
LINE 836: They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the
LINE 837: holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
LINE 838: coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible
LINE 839: even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in
LINE 840: catacombs, mummies the same idea.
LINE 841: Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
LINE 842: Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.
LINE 843: Death's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the
LINE 844: chapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
LINE 845: Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had
LINE 846: one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he
LINE 847: was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey
LINE 848: suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's
LINE 849: not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for
LINE 850: him.
LINE 851: The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
LINE 852: gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
LINE 853: Pause.
LINE 854: If we were all suddenly somebody else.
LINE 855: Far away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
LINE 856: say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
LINE 857: Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The
LINE 858: boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
LINE 859: the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly
LINE 860: caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which
LINE 861: will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment
LINE 862: you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake
LINE 863: must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I
LINE 864: haven't yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering
LINE 865: around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and
LINE 866: wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His
LINE 867: sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose
LINE 868: pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the
LINE 869: pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed. Devil in
LINE 870: that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace
LINE 871: her in his shirt. Last act of _Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee_?
LINE 872: Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you.
LINE 873: Don't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even
LINE 874: Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one
LINE 875: after the other.
LINE 876: We are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and
LINE 877: not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the
LINE 878: fire of purgatory.
LINE 879: Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do
LINE 880: when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning.
LINE 881: Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma,
LINE 882: poor mamma, and little Rudy.
LINE 883: The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
LINE 884: on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all
LINE 885: the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
LINE 886: course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some
LINE 887: law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a
LINE 888: telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of
LINE 889: distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well
LINE 890: to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.
LINE 891: The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
LINE 892: The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of
LINE 893: it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
LINE 894: without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make
LINE 895: its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground,
LINE 896: he traversed the dismal fields.
LINE 897: Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he
LINE 898: knows them all. No: coming to me.
LINE 899: —I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your
LINE 900: christian name? I'm not sure.
LINE 901: —L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He
LINE 902: asked me to.
LINE 903: —Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the _Freeman_ once.
LINE 904: So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good
LINE 905: idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He
LINE 906: died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
LINE 907: Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does
LINE 908: no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave
LINE 909: him under an obligation: costs nothing.
LINE 910: —And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
LINE 911: over there in the...
LINE 912: He looked around.
LINE 913: —Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
LINE 914: —M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his
LINE 915: name?
LINE 916: He moved away, looking about him.
LINE 917: —No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
LINE 918: Didn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
LINE 919: the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
LINE 920: Lord, what became of him?
LINE 921: A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
LINE 922: —O, excuse me!
LINE 923: He stepped aside nimbly.
LINE 924: Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
LINE 925: A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested
LINE 926: their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
LINE 927: his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
LINE 928: gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
LINE 929: the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One
LINE 930: bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his
LINE 931: mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
LINE 932: Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
LINE 933: The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
LINE 934: Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
LINE 935: yourselves just.
LINE 936: The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying
LINE 937: at whiles to read a name on a tomb.
LINE 938: —Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.
LINE 939: —Let us, Mr Power said.
LINE 940: They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
LINE 941: Power's blank voice spoke:
LINE 942: —Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
LINE 943: with stones. That one day he will come again.
LINE 944: Hynes shook his head.
LINE 945: —Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was
LINE 946: mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.
LINE 947: Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
LINE 948: broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
LINE 949: old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on
LINE 950: some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does
LINE 951: anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a
LINE 952: coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls' day.
LINE 953: Twentyseventh I'll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He
LINE 954: keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his
LINE 955: shears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed away. Who departed this
LINE 956: life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of
LINE 957: them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what
LINE 958: they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid
LINE 959: five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked
LINE 960: good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that
LINE 961: poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest
LINE 962: the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him
LINE 963: home. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly
LINE 964: plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the
LINE 965: _Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths
LINE 966: hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.
LINE 967: Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome,
LINE 968: never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.
LINE 969: A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
LINE 970: wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.
LINE 971: Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even
LINE 972: sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen
LINE 973: matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.
LINE 974: The Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
LINE 975: sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
LINE 976: dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
LINE 977: infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
LINE 978: of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the
LINE 979: boy. Apollo that was.
LINE 980: How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed.
LINE 981: As you are now so once were we.
LINE 982: Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
LINE 983: voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in
LINE 984: the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.
LINE 985: Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain
LINE 986: hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph
LINE 987: reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after
LINE 988: fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that
LINE 989: died when I was in Wisdom Hely's.
LINE 990: Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!
LINE 991: He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he
LINE 992: goes.
LINE 993: An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the
LINE 994: pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey
LINE 995: alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.
LINE 996: Good hidingplace for treasure.
LINE 997: Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was
LINE 998: buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.
LINE 999: Tail gone now.
LINE 1000: One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones
LINE 1001: clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat
LINE 1002: gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that
LINE 1003: _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a
LINE 1004: corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the
LINE 1005: other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the
LINE 1006: plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to
LINE 1007: ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by
LINE 1008: birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See
LINE 1009: your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't
LINE 1010: bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news
LINE 1011: go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication.
LINE 1012: We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed
LINE 1013: for them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They
LINE 1014: wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of
LINE 1015: corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.
LINE 1016: The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.
LINE 1017: Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I
LINE 1018: was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.
LINE 1019: And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I
LINE 1020: read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running
LINE 1021: gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after
LINE 1022: death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after
LINE 1023: death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like
LINE 1024: that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and
LINE 1025: feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their
LINE 1026: maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds:
LINE 1027: warm fullblooded life.
LINE 1028: Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.
LINE 1029: Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,
LINE 1030: commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.
LINE 1031: Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl,
LINE 1032: cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got
LINE 1033: his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside
LINE 1034: him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to
LINE 1035: me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the
LINE 1036: lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are
LINE 1037: by.
LINE 1038: Got a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.
LINE 1039: —Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.
LINE 1040: They stopped.
LINE 1041: —Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.
LINE 1042: John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.
LINE 1043: —There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.
LINE 1044: John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
LINE 1045: the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head
LINE 1046: again.
LINE 1047: —It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.
LINE 1048: John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.
LINE 1049: —Thank you, he said shortly.
LINE 1050: They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a
LINE 1051: few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin
LINE 1052: could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his
LINE 1053: seeing it.
LINE 1054: Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.
LINE 1055: Get the pull over him that way.
LINE 1056: Thank you. How grand we are this morning!
