LINE 1: —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
LINE 2: —Tarentum, sir.
LINE 3: —Very good. Well?
LINE 4: —There was a battle, sir.
LINE 5: —Very good. Where?
LINE 6: The boy's blank face asked the blank window.
LINE 7: Fabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
LINE 8: memory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake's wings
LINE 9: of excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
LINE 10: masonry, and time one livid final flame. What's left us then?
LINE 11: —I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
LINE 12: —Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the
LINE 13: gorescarred book.
LINE 14: —Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done
LINE 15: for._
LINE 16: That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a
LINE 17: hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
LINE 18: leaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
LINE 19: —You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
LINE 20: —End of Pyrrhus, sir?
LINE 21: —I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
LINE 22: —Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
LINE 23: A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong's satchel. He curled them
LINE 24: between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered
LINE 25: to the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy's breath. Welloff people,
LINE 26: proud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.
LINE 27: —Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
LINE 28: All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round
LINE 29: at his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
LINE 30: more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
LINE 31: —Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy's shoulder with the book,
LINE 32: what is a pier.
LINE 33: —A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
LINE 34: bridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
LINE 35: Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
LINE 36: whispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.
LINE 37: All. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
LINE 38: likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
LINE 39: tittering in the struggle.
LINE 40: —Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
LINE 41: The words troubled their gaze.
LINE 42: —How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
LINE 43: For Haines's chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
LINE 44: drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A
LINE 45: jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
LINE 46: clement master's praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
LINE 47: for the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other
LINE 48: too often heard, their land a pawnshop.
LINE 49: Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam's hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
LINE 50: been knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded
LINE 51: them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
LINE 52: possibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing
LINE 53: that they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?
LINE 54: Weave, weaver of the wind.
LINE 55: —Tell us a story, sir.
LINE 56: —O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
LINE 57: —Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
LINE 58: —_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.
LINE 59: —Go on then, Talbot.
LINE 60: —And the story, sir?
LINE 61: —After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
LINE 62: A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
LINE 63: of his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
LINE 64: _—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
LINE 65: For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
LINE 66: Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._
LINE 67: It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
LINE 68: Aristotle's phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
LINE 69: out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where
LINE 70: he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his
LINE 71: elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding
LINE 72: brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating
LINE 73: feelers: and in my mind's darkness a sloth of the underworld,
LINE 74: reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought
LINE 75: is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner
LINE 76: all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast,
LINE 77: candescent: form of forms.
LINE 78: Talbot repeated:
LINE 79: _—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
LINE 80: Through the dear might..._
LINE 81: —Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don't see anything.
LINE 82: —What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
LINE 83: His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
LINE 84: just remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these
LINE 85: craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer's heart and lips and
LINE 86: on mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
LINE 87: tribute. To Caesar what is Caesar's, to God what is God's. A long look
LINE 88: from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
LINE 89: church's looms. Ay.
LINE 90: Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
LINE 91: My father gave me seeds to sow.
LINE 92: Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
LINE 93: —Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
LINE 94: —Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
LINE 95: —Half day, sir. Thursday.
LINE 96: —Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
LINE 97: They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
LINE 98: Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all
LINE 99: gabbling gaily:
LINE 100: —A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
LINE 101: —O, ask me, sir.
LINE 102: —A hard one, sir.
LINE 103: —This is the riddle, Stephen said:
LINE 104: The cock crew,
LINE 105: The sky was blue:
LINE 106: The bells in heaven
LINE 107: Were striking eleven.
LINE 108: 'Tis time for this poor soul
LINE 109: To go to heaven.
LINE 110: What is that?
LINE 111: —What, sir?
LINE 112: —Again, sir. We didn't hear.
LINE 113: Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
LINE 114: Cochrane said:
LINE 115: —What is it, sir? We give it up.
LINE 116: Stephen, his throat itching, answered:
LINE 117: —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
LINE 118: He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
LINE 119: echoed dismay.
LINE 120: A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
LINE 121: —Hockey!
LINE 122: They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
LINE 123: they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
LINE 124: clamour of their boots and tongues.
LINE 125: Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
LINE 126: copybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
LINE 127: and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
LINE 128: cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
LINE 129: and damp as a snail's bed.
LINE 130: He held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.
LINE 131: Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
LINE 132: blind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
LINE 133: —Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them
LINE 134: to you, sir.
LINE 135: Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
LINE 136: —Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
LINE 137: —Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
LINE 138: copy them off the board, sir.
LINE 139: —Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
LINE 140: —No, sir.
LINE 141: Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
LINE 142: snail's bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
LINE 143: her heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
LINE 144: underfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery
LINE 145: blood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing in
LINE 146: life? His mother's prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
LINE 147: bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
LINE 148: the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from
LINE 149: being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor
LINE 150: soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red
LINE 151: reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the
LINE 152: earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
LINE 153: Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by
LINE 154: algebra that Shakespeare's ghost is Hamlet's grandfather. Sargent
LINE 155: peered askance through his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the
LINE 156: lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
LINE 157: Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
LINE 158: their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,
LINE 159: traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from
LINE 160: the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
LINE 161: movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
LINE 162: world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
LINE 163: comprehend.
LINE 164: —Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
LINE 165: —Yes, sir.
LINE 166: In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a
LINE 167: word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint
LINE 168: hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin. _Amor matris:_ subjective
LINE 169: and objective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
LINE 170: fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
LINE 171: Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My
LINE 172: childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
LINE 173: lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony
LINE 174: sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
LINE 175: tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
LINE 176: The sum was done.
LINE 177: —It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
LINE 178: —Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
LINE 179: He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
LINE 180: copybook back to his bench.
LINE 181: —You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said
LINE 182: as he followed towards the door the boy's graceless form.
LINE 183: —Yes, sir.
LINE 184: In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
LINE 185: —Sargent!
LINE 186: —Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
LINE 187: He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
LINE 188: field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
LINE 189: Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.
LINE 190: When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to
LINE 191: him. He turned his angry white moustache.
LINE 192: —What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
LINE 193: —Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
LINE 194: —Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
LINE 195: order here.
LINE 196: And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man's voice
LINE 197: cried sternly:
LINE 198: —What is the matter? What is it now?
LINE 199: Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms
LINE 200: closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his
LINE 201: illdyed head.
LINE 202: Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded
LINE 203: leather of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here.
LINE 204: As it was in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart
LINE 205: coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their
LINE 206: spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached
LINE 207: to all the gentiles: world without end.
LINE 208: A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
LINE 209: rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
LINE 210: —First, our little financial settlement, he said.
LINE 211: He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
LINE 212: slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
LINE 213: laid them carefully on the table.
LINE 214: —Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
LINE 215: And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen's embarrassed hand moved
LINE 216: over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
LINE 217: cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir's turban, and
LINE 218: this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim's hoard, dead
LINE 219: treasure, hollow shells.
LINE 220: A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
LINE 221: —Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.
LINE 222: These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is
LINE 223: for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
LINE 224: He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
LINE 225: —Three twelve, he said. I think you'll find that's right.
LINE 226: —Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
LINE 227: haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
LINE 228: —No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
LINE 229: Stephen's hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
LINE 230: of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed
LINE 231: and misery.
LINE 232: —Don't carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You'll pull it out somewhere
LINE 233: and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You'll find them very
LINE 234: handy.
LINE 235: Answer something.
LINE 236: —Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
LINE 237: The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times
LINE 238: now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant
LINE 239: if I will.
LINE 240: —Because you don't save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don't
LINE 241: know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as
LINE 242: I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare
LINE 243: say? _Put but money in thy purse._
LINE 244: —Iago, Stephen murmured.
LINE 245: He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man's stare.
LINE 246: —He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but
LINE 247: an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
LINE 248: know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman's
LINE 249: mouth?
LINE 250: The seas' ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
LINE 251: history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.
LINE 252: —That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
LINE 253: —Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That's not English. A French Celt said that. He
LINE 254: tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.
LINE 255: —I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. _I paid
LINE 256: my way._
LINE 257: Good man, good man.
LINE 258: _—I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel
LINE 259: that? _I owe nothing._ Can you?
LINE 260: Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
LINE 261: Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.
LINE 262: Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
LINE 263: Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
LINE 264: weeks' board. The lump I have is useless.
LINE 265: —For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
LINE 266: Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
LINE 267: —I knew you couldn't, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it.
LINE 268: We are a generous people but we must also be just.
LINE 269: —I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
LINE 270: Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
LINE 271: shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
LINE 272: Wales.
LINE 273: —You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.
LINE 274: I saw three generations since O'Connell's time. I remember the famine
LINE 275: in '46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
LINE 276: union twenty years before O'Connell did or before the prelates of your
LINE 277: communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.
LINE 278: Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
LINE 279: splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the
LINE 280: planters' covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie
LINE 281: down.
LINE 282: Stephen sketched a brief gesture.
LINE 283: —I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But
LINE 284: I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are
LINE 285: all Irish, all kings' sons.
LINE 286: —Alas, Stephen said.
LINE 287: —_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for
LINE 288: it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to
LINE 289: do so.
LINE 290: Lal the ral the ra
LINE 291: The rocky road to Dublin.
LINE 292: A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!
LINE 293: Soft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on
LINE 294: to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.
LINE 295: —That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
LINE 296: with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
LINE 297: Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
LINE 298: He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
LINE 299: off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
LINE 300: —Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of
LINE 301: common sense._ Just a moment.
LINE 302: He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
LINE 303: and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
LINE 304: sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
LINE 305: Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
LINE 306: around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
LINE 307: heads poised in air: lord Hastings' _Repulse_, the duke of
LINE 308: Westminster's _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort's _Ceylon_, _prix de
LINE 309: Paris_, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their
LINE 310: speeds, backing king's colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished
LINE 311: crowds.
LINE 312: —Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. _But prompt ventilation of this
LINE 313: allimportant question..._
LINE 314: Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
LINE 315: mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
LINE 316: of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to
LINE 317: one the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs,
LINE 318: the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher's
LINE 319: dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.
LINE 320: Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.
LINE 321: Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a
LINE 322: medley, the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling
LINE 323: who seems to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock
LINE 324: by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of
LINE 325: the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.
LINE 326: —Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
LINE 327: He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
LINE 328: —I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It's about the
LINE 329: foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two
LINE 330: opinions on the matter.
LINE 331: May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of _laissez faire_
LINE 332: which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
LINE 333: industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
LINE 334: European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the
LINE 335: channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
LINE 336: agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who
LINE 337: was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.
LINE 338: —I don't mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
LINE 339: Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch's preparation. Serum and virus.
LINE 340: Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor's horses at Mürzsteg,
LINE 341: lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous
LINE 342: offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In
LINE 343: every sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for
LINE 344: the hospitality of your columns.
LINE 345: —I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the
LINE 346: next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be
LINE 347: cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
LINE 348: regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They
LINE 349: offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the
LINE 350: department. Now I'm going to try publicity. I am surrounded by
LINE 351: difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...
LINE 352: He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
LINE 353: —Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
LINE 354: jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
LINE 355: the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
LINE 356: nation's vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure as
LINE 357: we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
LINE 358: destruction. Old England is dying.
LINE 359: He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
LINE 360: broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
LINE 361: —Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
LINE 362: The harlot's cry from street to street
LINE 363: Shall weave old England's windingsheet.
LINE 364: His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
LINE 365: he halted.
LINE 366: —A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
LINE 367: gentile, is he not?
LINE 368: —They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
LINE 369: the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
LINE 370: earth to this day.
LINE 371: On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
LINE 372: prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
LINE 373: uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit
LINE 374: silk hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.
LINE 375: Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and
LINE 376: unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their
LINE 377: zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would
LINE 378: scatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.
LINE 379: Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the
LINE 380: dishonours of their flesh.
LINE 381: —Who has not? Stephen said.
LINE 382: —What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
LINE 383: He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
LINE 384: sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from
LINE 385: me.
LINE 386: —History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
LINE 387: From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
LINE 388: What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
LINE 389: —The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
LINE 390: history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.
LINE 391: Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
LINE 392: —That is God.
LINE 393: Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
LINE 394: —What? Mr Deasy asked.
LINE 395: —A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
LINE 396: Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
LINE 397: between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.
LINE 398: —I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
LINE 399: many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
LINE 400: better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
LINE 401: years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the
LINE 402: strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough's wife and her leman,
LINE 403: O'Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many
LINE 404: errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the
LINE 405: end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.
LINE 406: For Ulster will fight
LINE 407: And Ulster will be right.
LINE 408: Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.
LINE 409: —Well, sir, he began.
LINE 410: —I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
LINE 411: this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
LINE 412: wrong.
LINE 413: —A learner rather, Stephen said.
LINE 414: And here what will you learn more?
LINE 415: Mr Deasy shook his head.
LINE 416: —Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
LINE 417: teacher.
LINE 418: Stephen rustled the sheets again.
LINE 419: —As regards these, he began.
LINE 420: —Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
LINE 421: published at once.
LINE 422: _ Telegraph. Irish Homestead._
LINE 423: —I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two
LINE 424: editors slightly.
LINE 425: —That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
LINE 426: M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the
LINE 427: City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
LINE 428: see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
LINE 429: _—The Evening Telegraph..._
LINE 430: —That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
LINE 431: answer that letter from my cousin.
LINE 432: —Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
LINE 433: Thank you.
LINE 434: —Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I
LINE 435: like to break a lance with you, old as I am.
LINE 436: —Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
LINE 437: He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,
LINE 438: hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The
LINE 439: lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:
LINE 440: toothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will
LINE 441: dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.
LINE 442: —Mr Dedalus!
LINE 443: Running after me. No more letters, I hope.
LINE 444: —Just one moment.
LINE 445: —Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
LINE 446: Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
LINE 447: —I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
LINE 448: being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know
LINE 449: that? No. And do you know why?
LINE 450: He frowned sternly on the bright air.
LINE 451: —Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
LINE 452: —Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
LINE 453: A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
LINE 454: rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
LINE 455: his lifted arms waving to the air.
LINE 456: —She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
LINE 457: stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That's why.
LINE 458: On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung
LINE 459: spangles, dancing coins.
