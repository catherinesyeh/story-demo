LINE 1: Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
LINE 2: the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
LINE 3: generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His
LINE 4: (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a
LINE 5: bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
LINE 6: Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry
LINE 7: water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit
LINE 8: upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the
LINE 9: cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt
LINE 10: bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk
LINE 11: and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce
LINE 12: he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon
LINE 13: him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and
LINE 14: means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he
LINE 15: was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly
LINE 16: advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in
LINE 17: their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen,
LINE 18: always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly
LINE 19: after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having
LINE 20: forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had
LINE 21: done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together
LINE 22: along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier's and
LINE 23: the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
LINE 24: Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
LINE 25: debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But
LINE 26: as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
LINE 27: hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
LINE 28: fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
LINE 29: no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
LINE 30: anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by
LINE 31: emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head,
LINE 32: twice.
LINE 33: This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
LINE 34: there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
LINE 35: which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett's and the
LINE 36: Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
LINE 37: direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
LINE 38: by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
LINE 39: to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
LINE 40: entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
LINE 41: light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed
LINE 42: for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
LINE 43: cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they
LINE 44: dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a
LINE 45: fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's
LINE 46: sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his
LINE 47: companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of
LINE 48: some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great
LINE 49: Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of
LINE 50: course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the
LINE 51: backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say
LINE 52: gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the
LINE 53: Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its
LINE 54: C division police station. Between this point and the high at present
LINE 55: unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen,
LINE 56: associated with Baird's the stonecutter's in his mind somehow in Talbot
LINE 57: place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as
LINE 58: his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of
LINE 59: James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were,
LINE 60: the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities
LINE 61: of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of
LINE 62: life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke's the
LINE 63: baker's it is said.
LINE 64: _En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
LINE 65: yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in
LINE 66: complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact
LINE 67: disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of
LINE 68: nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely
LINE 69: permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of
LINE 70: the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age
LINE 71: particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence
LINE 72: of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as
LINE 73: even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if
LINE 74: you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the
LINE 75: scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for
LINE 76: that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might
LINE 77: have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or,
LINE 78: failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day
LINE 79: before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant
LINE 80: to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got
LINE 81: bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those
LINE 82: policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in
LINE 83: the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or
LINE 84: two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole
LINE 85: through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet
LINE 86: parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law
LINE 87: were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to
LINE 88: protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping
LINE 89: soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off
LINE 90: at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians
LINE 91: should by any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away
LINE 92: your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character
LINE 93: besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the
LINE 94: _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £. s. d. into the bargain and the
LINE 95: greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the
LINE 96: much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old
LINE 97: wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing
LINE 98: aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch
LINE 99: believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably
LINE 100: drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of
LINE 101: your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he
LINE 102: commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting
LINE 103: _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his
LINE 104: brother medicos under all the circs.
LINE 105: —And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
LINE 106: whatsoever of any kind.
LINE 107: Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
LINE 108: of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a
LINE 109: brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one
LINE 110: attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord
LINE 111: stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren
LINE 112: cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just
LINE 113: make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom
LINE 114: of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had
LINE 115: been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small
LINE 116: effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a
LINE 117: _quondam_ friend of his father's, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew
LINE 118: nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.
LINE 119: —Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 120: A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
LINE 121: saluted again, calling:
LINE 122: —Night!
LINE 123: Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
LINE 124: compliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
LINE 125: as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
LINE 126: nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety
LINE 127: though not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he
LINE 128: knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
LINE 129: to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
LINE 130: peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
LINE 131: secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames
LINE 132: embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply
LINE 133: marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell
LINE 134: swoop at a moment's notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
LINE 135: to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.
LINE 136: Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
LINE 137: though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley's
LINE 138: breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him
LINE 139: and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of
LINE 140: inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a
LINE 141: certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His
LINE 142: grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of
LINE 143: a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.
LINE 144: Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
LINE 145: the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
LINE 146: fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
LINE 147: some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had
LINE 148: enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This
LINE 149: therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though
LINE 150: dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with
LINE 151: facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.
LINE 152: Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.
LINE 153: Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends
LINE 154: had all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
LINE 155: him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of
LINE 156: other uncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of
LINE 157: Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something,
LINE 158: anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the
LINE 159: washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they
LINE 160: were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences
LINE 161: happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete
LINE 162: fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.
LINE 163: —I wouldn't ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
LINE 164: I'm on the rocks.
LINE 165: —There'll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys'
LINE 166: school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You
LINE 167: may mention my name.
LINE 168: —Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was
LINE 169: never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck
LINE 170: twice in the junior at the christian brothers.
LINE 171: —I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
LINE 172: Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
LINE 173: do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
LINE 174: tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
LINE 175: Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
LINE 176: M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
LINE 177: in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
LINE 178: addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he
LINE 179: hadn't said a word about it.
LINE 180: Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
LINE 181: still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he
LINE 182: knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was
LINE 183: hardly deserving of much credence. However _haud ignarus malorum
LINE 184: miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially
LINE 185: as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the
LINE 186: month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of
LINE 187: fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream
LINE 188: of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley's head that he was
LINE 189: living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful.
LINE 190: Whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of
LINE 191: finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a
LINE 192: bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get
LINE 193: sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his
LINE 194: chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the
LINE 195: result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the
LINE 196: moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in
LINE 197: that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse
LINE 198: in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough
LINE 199: search though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimly
LINE 200: remembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did
LINE 201: he buy. However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in
LINE 202: the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.
LINE 203: —Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
LINE 204: And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him
LINE 205: one of them.
LINE 206: —Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. I'll pay you back one
LINE 207: time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
LINE 208: in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good
LINE 209: word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only
LINE 210: the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three
LINE 211: weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the
LINE 212: Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as
LINE 213: a crossing sweeper.
LINE 214: Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
LINE 215: he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
LINE 216: that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's,
LINE 217: bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle's back with
LINE 218: O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he
LINE 219: was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and
LINE 220: disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.
LINE 221: Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
LINE 222: cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
LINE 223: watchman's sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
LINE 224: was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
LINE 225: private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same
LINE 226: time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired
LINE 227: interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though
LINE 228: where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the
LINE 229: remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give
LINE 230: points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on
LINE 231: his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally
LINE 232: testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his
LINE 233: hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one
LINE 234: preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put
LINE 235: it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street
LINE 236: chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the
LINE 237: option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether. In any case he
LINE 238: had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that
LINE 239: hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.
LINE 240: The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
LINE 241: practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
LINE 242: blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he
LINE 243: said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:
LINE 244: —He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
LINE 245: Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
LINE 246: At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
LINE 247: Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
LINE 248: direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
LINE 249: moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
LINE 250: whereupon he observed evasively:
LINE 251: —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it
LINE 252: his face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much
LINE 253: did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
LINE 254: —Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep
LINE 255: somewhere.
LINE 256: —Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the
LINE 257: intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
LINE 258: invariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
LINE 259: to his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he
LINE 260: with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of
LINE 261: the question. And even supposing you did you won't get in after what
LINE 262: occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I
LINE 263: don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
LINE 264: did you leave your father's house?
LINE 265: —To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.
LINE 266: —I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
LINE 267: diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
LINE 268: yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of
LINE 269: conversation that he had moved.
LINE 270: —I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.
LINE 271: Why?
LINE 272: —A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects
LINE 273: than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one. He takes great
LINE 274: pride, quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he
LINE 275: hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row
LINE 276: terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan,
LINE 277: that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred
LINE 278: their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally
LINE 279: station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion,
LINE 280: which they did.
LINE 281: There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
LINE 282: was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
LINE 283: family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
LINE 284: the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
LINE 285: cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
LINE 286: could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
LINE 287: they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
LINE 288: Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
LINE 289: and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
LINE 290: accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on
LINE 291: the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
LINE 292: something like that.
LINE 293: —No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust
LINE 294: in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element,
LINE 295: Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your
LINE 296: shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all
LINE 297: probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.
LINE 298: Of course you didn't notice as much as I did. But it wouldn't occasion
LINE 299: me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic
LINE 300: was put in your drink for some ulterior object.
LINE 301: He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a
LINE 302: versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was
LINE 303: rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified,
LINE 304: bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future
LINE 305: as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
LINE 306: in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
LINE 307: certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid
LINE 308: at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
LINE 309: exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
LINE 310: frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
LINE 311: at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or
LINE 312: jealousy, pure and simple.
LINE 313: —Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
LINE 314: your brains, he ventured to throw out.
LINE 315: The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
LINE 316: friendliness which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of
LINE 317: features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
LINE 318: problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge
LINE 319: by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about
LINE 320: saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to
LINE 321: himself allowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that
LINE 322: effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities
LINE 323: though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both
LINE 324: ends meet.
LINE 325: Adjacent to the men's public urinal they perceived an icecream car
LINE 326: round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were
LINE 327: getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a
LINE 328: particularly animated way, there being some little differences between
LINE 329: the parties.
LINE 330: —_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!_
LINE 331: _—Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano più..._
LINE 332: _—Dice lui, però!_
LINE 333: _—Mezzo._
LINE 334: _—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_
LINE 335: _—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più..._
LINE 336: Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious
LINE 337: wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
LINE 338: before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
LINE 339: hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
LINE 340: Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
LINE 341: facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few
LINE 342: moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet
LINE 343: corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous
LINE 344: collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the
LINE 345: genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified
LINE 346: by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked
LINE 347: curiosity.
LINE 348: —Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
LINE 349: to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
LINE 350: shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.
LINE 351: Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order
LINE 352: these commodities quietly. The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or
LINE 353: whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
LINE 354: apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous
LINE 355: individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still
LINE 356: stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention
LINE 357: to the floor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech,
LINE 358: he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute,
LINE 359: though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his
LINE 360: _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in
LINE 361: the street which was still raging fast and furious:
LINE 362: —A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not
LINE 363: write your poetry in that language? _Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious
LINE 364: and full. _Belladonna. Voglio._
LINE 365: Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
LINE 366: from lassitude generally, replied:
LINE 367: —To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
LINE 368: —Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
LINE 369: inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
LINE 370: absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that
LINE 371: surrounds it.
LINE 372: The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a
LINE 373: boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the
LINE 374: table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.
LINE 375: After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to
LINE 376: have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For
LINE 377: which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he
LINE 378: did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was
LINE 379: temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
LINE 380: —Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
LINE 381: like names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.
LINE 382: Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?
LINE 383: —Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name
LINE 384: was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
LINE 385: The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
LINE 386: Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
LINE 387: by asking:
LINE 388: —And what might your name be?
LINE 389: Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but
LINE 390: Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
LINE 391: quarter, answered:
LINE 392: —Dedalus.
LINE 393: The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
LINE 394: rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
LINE 395: Hollands and water.
LINE 396: —You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
LINE 397: —I've heard of him, Stephen said.
LINE 398: Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
LINE 399: eavesdropping too.
LINE 400: —He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
LINE 401: way and nodding. All Irish.
LINE 402: —All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
LINE 403: As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole
LINE 404: business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when
LINE 405: the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the
LINE 406: shelter with the remark:
LINE 407: —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
LINE 408: shoulder. The lefthand dead shot.
LINE 409: Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
LINE 410: gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
LINE 411: —Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.
LINE 412: Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
LINE 413: He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then
LINE 414: he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the
LINE 415: night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
LINE 416: —Pom! he then shouted once.
LINE 417: The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation,
LINE 418: there being still a further egg.
LINE 419: —Pom! he shouted twice.
LINE 420: Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
LINE 421: bloodthirstily:
LINE 422: _—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
LINE 423: Never missed nor he never will._
LINE 424: A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like
LINE 425: asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
LINE 426: Bisley.
LINE 427: —Beg pardon, the sailor said.
LINE 428: —Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
LINE 429: —Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
LINE 430: influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He
LINE 431: toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that
LINE 432: in Stockholm.
LINE 433: —Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
LINE 434: —Murphy's my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.
LINE 435: Know where that is?
LINE 436: —Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.
LINE 437: —That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's
LINE 438: where I hails from. I belongs there. That's where I hails from. My
LINE 439: little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. _For England,
LINE 440: home and beauty_. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years
LINE 441: now, sailing about.
LINE 442: Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
LINE 443: to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a
LINE 444: rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a
LINE 445: number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
LINE 446: Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember
LINE 447: Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way
LINE 448: of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.
LINE 449: Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
LINE 450: absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he
LINE 451: finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
LINE 452: his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but
LINE 453: I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,
LINE 454: at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
LINE 455: deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
LINE 456: publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
LINE 457: onions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on
LINE 458: her knee, _post mortem_ child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my
LINE 459: galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I
LINE 460: remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W. B. Murphy.
LINE 461: The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
LINE 462: of the jarvies with the request:
LINE 463: —You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?
LINE 464: The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die
LINE 465: of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object
LINE 466: was passed from hand to hand.
LINE 467: —Thank you, the sailor said.
LINE 468: He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
LINE 469: stammers, proceeded:
LINE 470: —We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster _Rosevean_
LINE 471: from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this
LINE 472: afternoon. There's my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.
LINE 473: In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
LINE 474: and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.
LINE 475: —You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
LINE 476: leaning on the counter.
LINE 477: —Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated
LINE 478: a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and
LINE 479: North America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I
LINE 480: seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
LINE 481: the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
LINE 482: scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. _Gospodi pomilyou_. That's how the
LINE 483: Russians prays.
LINE 484: —You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.
LINE 485: —Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer
LINE 486: things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
LINE 487: anchor same as I chew that quid.
LINE 488: He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
LINE 489: teeth, bit ferociously:
LINE 490: —Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
LINE 491: the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent
LINE 492: me.
LINE 493: He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed
LINE 494: to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.
LINE 495: The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia._
LINE 496: All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
LINE 497: women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
LINE 498: sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
LINE 499: them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
LINE 500: —Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like
LINE 501: breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more
LINE 502: children.
LINE 503: See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver
LINE 504: raw.
LINE 505: His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns
LINE 506: for several minutes if not more.
LINE 507: —Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.
LINE 508: Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
LINE 509: —Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.
LINE 510: Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
LINE 511: card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran
LINE 512: as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
LINE 513: Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.
LINE 514: Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
LINE 515: eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
LINE 516: Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which
LINE 517: occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat) having
LINE 518: detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he
LINE 519: represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after
LINE 520: having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the
LINE 521: fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
LINE 522: suspicions of our friend's _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in
LINE 523: a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some
LINE 524: Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say
LINE 525: that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was
LINE 526: at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had
LINE 527: consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead
LINE 528: which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work
LINE 529: a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up
LINE 530: with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it
LINE 531: did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was
LINE 532: not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering
LINE 533: the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there
LINE 534: and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone
LINE 535: and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose
LINE 536: liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route,
LINE 537: Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive
LINE 538: tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern
LINE 539: Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,
LINE 540: abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing
LINE 541: just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze
LINE 542: around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a
LINE 543: concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure
LINE 544: resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas,
LINE 545: Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the
LINE 546: Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly
LINE 547: remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or
LINE 548: local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M'Coy type lend me your valise
LINE 549: and I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star
LINE 550: Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal
LINE 551: consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes
LINE 552: and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of
LINE 553: success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some
LINE 554: fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and
LINE 555: thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.
LINE 556: Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was
LINE 557: to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with
LINE 558: the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was
LINE 559: mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments
LINE 560: with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete
LINE 561: fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly
LINE 562: was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public
LINE 563: at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.
LINE 564: It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
LINE 565: small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
LINE 566: system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
LINE 567: pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
LINE 568: of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took
LINE 569: me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more
LINE 570: humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the
LINE 571: grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at
LINE 572: her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.
LINE 573: There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home
LINE 574: island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora
LINE 575: of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
LINE 576: Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there
LINE 577: was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in
LINE 578: Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood
LINE 579: for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds
LINE 580: of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d'œil_ was exceedingly
LINE 581: grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that
LINE 582: the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering
LINE 583: the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
LINE 584: associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV,
LINE 585: rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt
LINE 586: with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when
LINE 587: young men's fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off
LINE 588: the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their
LINE 589: left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the
LINE 590: pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
LINE 591: in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
LINE 592: desired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
LINE 593: curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
LINE 594: the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
LINE 595: other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.
LINE 596: —I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
LINE 597: little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened
LINE 598: and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a
LINE 599: house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly
LINE 600: added, the chinks does.
LINE 601: Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
LINE 602: globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.
LINE 603: —And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his
LINE 604: back. Knife like that.
LINE 605: Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
LINE 606: keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.
LINE 607: —In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.
LINE 608: Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. _Prepare to
LINE 609: meet your God_, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.
LINE 610: His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
LINE 611: questions even should they by any chance want to.
LINE 612: —That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
LINE 613: _stiletto_.
LINE 614: After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he
LINE 615: snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before
LINE 616: in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.
LINE 617: —They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
LINE 618: the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought
LINE 619: the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account
LINE 620: of them using knives.
LINE 621: At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is
LINE 622: bliss_ Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
LINE 623: instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
LINE 624: strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat,
LINE 625: _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid
LINE 626: from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of
LINE 627: art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the
LINE 628: impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on.
LINE 629: Funny, very!
LINE 630: There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and
LINE 631: starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
LINE 632: natives _choza de_, another the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as
LINE 633: he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He
LINE 634: vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
LINE 635: as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
LINE 636: land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
LINE 637: speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
LINE 638: just turned fifteen.
LINE 639: —Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.
LINE 640: The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.
LINE 641: —Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.
LINE 642: The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
LINE 643: no.
LINE 644: —Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
LINE 645: had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences
LINE 646: but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the
LINE 647: sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.
LINE 648: —What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the
LINE 649: boats?
LINE 650: Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before
LINE 651: answering:
LINE 652: —I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.
LINE 653: Salt junk all the time.
LINE 654: Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not
LINE 655: likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
LINE 656: fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
LINE 657: globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
LINE 658: it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
LINE 659: what it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at
LINE 660: the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
LINE 661: superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
LINE 662: not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
LINE 663: it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
LINE 664: somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried
LINE 665: to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the
LINE 666: antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not
LINE 667: exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil
LINE 668: there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going
LINE 669: into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that
LINE 670: the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things
LINE 671: somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence
LINE 672: though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that
LINE 673: sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery
LINE 674: and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for
LINE 675: that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable
LINE 676: institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland
LINE 677: or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like
LINE 678: that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and
LINE 679: coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid
LINE 680: the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that
LINE 681: every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the
LINE 682: wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to
LINE 683: capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had
LINE 684: experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.
LINE 685: —There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog,
LINE 686: himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as
LINE 687: gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me
LINE 688: and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job,
LINE 689: shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny,
LINE 690: run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where
LINE 691: he could be drawing easy money.
LINE 692: —What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the
LINE 693: side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away
LINE 694: from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy
LINE 695: getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.
LINE 696: —Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?
LINE 697: He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.
LINE 698: The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
LINE 699: shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was
LINE 700: to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent
LINE 701: an anchor.
LINE 702: —There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.
LINE 703: I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects
LINE 704: to. I hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.
LINE 705: Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
LINE 706: his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
LINE 707: mariner's hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
LINE 708: young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.
LINE 709: —Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying
LINE 710: becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the
LINE 711: name of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.
LINE 712: —Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.
LINE 713: That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.
LINE 714: Someway in his. Squeezing or.
LINE 715: —See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And
LINE 716: there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
LINE 717: fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
LINE 718: And in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did
LINE 719: actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
LINE 720: unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
LINE 721: time stretched over.
LINE 722: —Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone
LINE 723: too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.
LINE 724: He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
LINE 725: of before.
LINE 726: —Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.
LINE 727: —And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.
LINE 728: —Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.
LINE 729: —Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time
LINE 730: with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the
LINE 731: direction of the questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.
LINE 732: And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his
LINE 733: alleged end:
LINE 734: —As bad as old Antonio,
LINE 735: For he left me on my ownio.
LINE 736: The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
LINE 737: peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
LINE 738: her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom,
LINE 739: scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
LINE 740: flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
LINE 741: sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
LINE 742: laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
LINE 743: why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round
LINE 744: the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
LINE 745: afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
LINE 746: lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
LINE 747: and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed
LINE 748: rather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to
LINE 749: admit he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles
LINE 750: street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled
LINE 751: with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they
LINE 752: really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still
LINE 753: just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than
LINE 754: her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a
LINE 755: rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the _Evening
LINE 756: Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side
LINE 757: of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was
LINE 758: not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of
LINE 759: gazers round skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more
LINE 760: of her.
LINE 761: —The gunboat, the keeper said.
LINE 762: —It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
LINE 763: how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
LINE 764: disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
LINE 765: senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of
LINE 766: course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.
LINE 767: Still no matter what the cause is from...
LINE 768: Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
LINE 769: remarking:
LINE 770: —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
LINE 771: roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
LINE 772: buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
LINE 773: The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a
LINE 774: prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be
LINE 775: put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart
LINE 776: from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil,
LINE 777: were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a
LINE 778: thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a
LINE 779: stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a
LINE 780: policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would
LINE 781: confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.
LINE 782: —You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
LINE 783: in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
LINE 784: as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I
LINE 785: believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men
LINE 786: as the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have
LINE 787: such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?
LINE 788: Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
LINE 789: and concentrate and remember before he could say:
LINE 790: —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
LINE 791: therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for
LINE 792: the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
LINE 793: can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
LINE 794: practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both
LINE 795: being excluded by court etiquette.
LINE 796: Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
LINE 797: mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he
LINE 798: felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
LINE 799: rejoining:
LINE 800: —Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant
LINE 801: you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
LINE 802: blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
LINE 803: instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,
LINE 804: though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
LINE 805: and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
LINE 806: phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour
LINE 807: to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
LINE 808: —O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
LINE 809: of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
LINE 810: evidence.
LINE 811: On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
LINE 812: were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference
LINE 813: in their respective ages, clashed.
LINE 814: —Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
LINE 815: original point with a smile of unbelief. I'm not so sure about that.
LINE 816: That's a matter for everyman's opinion and, without dragging in the
LINE 817: sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_
LINE 818: there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were
LINE 819: genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the
LINE 820: big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them
LINE 821: like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely
LINE 822: better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that
LINE 823: coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It's
LINE 824: like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what
LINE 825: he hasn't got. Try a bit.
LINE 826: —Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
LINE 827: moment refusing to dictate further.
LINE 828: Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
LINE 829: or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with
LINE 830: something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance
LINE 831: (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond
LINE 832: yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they
LINE 833: were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic
LINE 834: evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the
LINE 835: lower orders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful
LINE 836: recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been
LINE 837: prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration
LINE 838: indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to
LINE 839: believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to
LINE 840: speak of. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas
LINE 841: he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he
LINE 842: couldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical
LINE 843: inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary
LINE 844: which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on
LINE 845: account of the medical analysis involved.
LINE 846: —Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
LINE 847: stirred.
LINE 848: Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
LINE 849: from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
LINE 850: took a sip of the offending beverage.
LINE 851: —Still it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid
LINE 852: food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
LINE 853: regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental
LINE 854: or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different
LINE 855: man.
LINE 856: —Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that
LINE 857: knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.
LINE 858: Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated
LINE 859: article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly
LINE 860: Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was
LINE 861: the least conspicuous point about it.
LINE 862: —Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of
LINE 863: knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_. Do you think they are
LINE 864: genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
LINE 865: lie like old boots. Look at him.
LINE 866: Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
LINE 867: full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
LINE 868: was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire
LINE 869: fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
LINE 870: probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
LINE 871: accurate gospel.
LINE 872: He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
LINE 873: Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a
LINE 874: wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
LINE 875: there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a
LINE 876: jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to
LINE 877: associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill
LINE 878: fraternity. He might even have done for his man supposing it was his
LINE 879: own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he
LINE 880: killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in
LINE 881: durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to
LINE 882: the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our
LINE 883: national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above
LINE 884: described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable
LINE 885: weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like
LINE 886: those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner
LINE 887: who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner
LINE 888: _Hesperus_ and etcetera. And when all was said and done the lies a
LINE 889: fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to
LINE 890: the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.
LINE 891: —Mind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed.
LINE 892: Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,
LINE 893: though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
LINE 894: midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
LINE 895: Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn't straighten
LINE 896: their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
LINE 897: proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
LINE 898: or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
LINE 899: powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
LINE 900: gods. There's an example again of simple souls.
LINE 901: However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
LINE 902: reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the
LINE 903: boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
LINE 904: management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host
LINE 905: of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
LINE 906: though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
LINE 907: fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
LINE 908: incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the
LINE 909: back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
LINE 910: was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the
LINE 911: fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in
LINE 912: little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking
LINE 913: fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless
LINE 914: necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to
LINE 915: have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or
LINE 916: her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.
LINE 917: —Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
LINE 918: that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
LINE 919: hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
LINE 920: carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.
LINE 921: My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could
LINE 922: actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
LINE 923: (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite
LINE 924: dark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate
LINE 925: accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
LINE 926: in Italian.
LINE 927: —The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
LINE 928: passionate about ten shillings. _Roberto ruba roba sua_.
LINE 929: —Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.
LINE 930: —Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
LINE 931: listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
LINE 932: triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
LINE 933: Tommaso Mastino.
LINE 934: —It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the
LINE 935: blood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
LINE 936: street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,
LINE 937: and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid
LINE 938: proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind
LINE 939: of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a
LINE 940: way you find but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides
LINE 941: they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly
LINE 942: enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled
LINE 943: stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it's a
LINE 944: thing I simply hate to see.
LINE 945: Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
LINE 946: others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
LINE 947: collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course
LINE 948: had his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
LINE 949: weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
LINE 950: those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
LINE 951: or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.
LINE 952: So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt's rock, wreck
LINE 953: of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
LINE 954: the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry
LINE 955: Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand. That was the talk
LINE 956: of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of
LINE 957: original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish
LINE 958: _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore
LINE 959: in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about
LINE 960: the case of the s. s. _Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_
LINE 961: which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with
LINE 962: all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the _Mona_'s, said he
LINE 963: was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it
LINE 964: appears, in her hold.
LINE 965: At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him
LINE 966: to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.
LINE 967: —Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
LINE 968: gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.
LINE 969: He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
LINE 970: stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
LINE 971: due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
LINE 972: noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's
LINE 973: rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
LINE 974: burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew
LINE 975: and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig
LINE 976: out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had
LINE 977: a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the
LINE 978: counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
LINE 979: to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
LINE 980: duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
LINE 981: girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was
LINE 982: all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some
LINE 983: person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by
LINE 984: the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a
LINE 985: brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor,
LINE 986: evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the
LINE 987: noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the
LINE 988: ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped
LINE 989: anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly
LINE 990: disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of
LINE 991: the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking
LINE 992: up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now
LINE 993: practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin
LINE 994: in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before
LINE 995: shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again
LINE 996: in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its
LINE 997: most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and
LINE 998: familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a
LINE 999: cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass
LINE 1000: proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the
LINE 1001: end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink
LINE 1002: without a beggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed
LINE 1003: only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of
LINE 1004: business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his
LINE 1005: particular partiality.
LINE 1006: All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
LINE 1007: coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the
LINE 1008: same thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra
LINE 1009: basin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there
LINE 1010: only no ships ever called.
LINE 1011: There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au
LINE 1012: fait_.
LINE 1013: What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
LINE 1014: rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
LINE 1015: Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he
LINE 1016: advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that
LINE 1017: day's work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.
LINE 1018: —Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
LINE 1019: private potation and the rest of his exertions.
LINE 1020: That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
LINE 1021: growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or
LINE 1022: other in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then
LINE 1023: expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have
LINE 1024: lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and
LINE 1025: making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in
LINE 1026: question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful
LINE 1027: libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the
LINE 1028: _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:
LINE 1029: —The biscuits was as hard as brass
LINE 1030: And the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.
LINE 1031: O, Johnny Lever!
LINE 1032: Johnny Lever, O!
LINE 1033: After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
LINE 1034: and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
LINE 1035: provided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
LINE 1036: grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
LINE 1037: the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
LINE 1038: described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none
LINE 1039: on the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal
LINE 1040: in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every
LINE 1041: year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained
LINE 1042: out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through
LINE 1043: the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot
LINE 1044: more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly
LINE 1045: became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any
LINE 1046: mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel
LINE 1047: Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find
LINE 1048: anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated
LINE 1049: _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the
LINE 1050: conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of
LINE 1051: pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest
LINE 1052: fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their
LINE 1053: little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end.
LINE 1054: Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be
LINE 1055: Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the
LINE 1056: vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at
LINE 1057: once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the
LINE 1058: tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay
LINE 1059: in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.
LINE 1060: Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.
LINE 1061: Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_. The
LINE 1062: impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.
LINE 1063: —Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a
LINE 1064: bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.
LINE 1065: To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
LINE 1066: concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.
LINE 1067: —Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately
LINE 1068: interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals
LINE 1069: and generals we've got? Tell me that.
LINE 1070: —The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
LINE 1071: blemishes apart.
LINE 1072: —That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic
LINE 1073: peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?
LINE 1074: While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
LINE 1075: he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no
LINE 1076: Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a
LINE 1077: few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say,
LINE 1078: appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with
LINE 1079: interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to
LINE 1080: blows.
LINE 1081: From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
LINE 1082: rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
LINE 1083: pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he
LINE 1084: was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the
LINE 1085: channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for,
LINE 1086: rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a
LINE 1087: par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred
LINE 1088: million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out
LINE 1089: and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all
LINE 1090: he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of
LINE 1091: contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it
LINE 1092: was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both
LINE 1093: countries even though poles apart. Another little interesting point,
LINE 1094: the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance,
LINE 1095: reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against
LINE 1096: her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of
LINE 1097: them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris,
LINE 1098: the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him
LINE 1099: forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing,
LINE 1100: that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human
LINE 1101: soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the
LINE 1102: lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (B.)
LINE 1103: couldn't help feeling and most properly it was better to give people
LINE 1104: like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and
LINE 1105: refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private
LINE 1106: life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a
LINE 1107: Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence or king's now like
LINE 1108: Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from
LINE 1109: that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.
LINE 1110: Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his
LINE 1111: bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it
LINE 1112: (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for
LINE 1113: a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage
LINE 1114: of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a
LINE 1115: party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of
LINE 1116: the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently,
LINE 1117: after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with
LINE 1118: the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted
LINE 1119: fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative
LINE 1120: postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just
LINE 1121: struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for
LINE 1122: the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was
LINE 1123: reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of
LINE 1124: fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case
LINE 1125: that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo
LINE 1126: Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought
LINE 1127: to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses,
LINE 1128: always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.
LINE 1129: Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any
LINE 1130: idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So
LINE 1131: similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid
LINE 1132: of some £. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in
LINE 1133: the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin
LINE 1134: and so on. Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the
LINE 1135: same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually
LINE 1136: silenced the offender.
LINE 1137: —He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
LINE 1138: whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and
LINE 1139: in a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain
LINE 1140: facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and
LINE 1141: all his family like me though in reality I'm not. That was one for him.
LINE 1142: A soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as
LINE 1143: everyone saw. Am I not right?
LINE 1144: He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
LINE 1145: at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
LINE 1146: glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.
LINE 1147: —_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or
LINE 1148: four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any
LINE 1149: other, _secundum carnem_.
LINE 1150: —Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides
LINE 1151: of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to
LINE 1152: right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
LINE 1153: though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
LINE 1154: government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all
LINE 1155: very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual
LINE 1156: equality. I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It
LINE 1157: never reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the
LINE 1158: due instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
LINE 1159: people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
LINE 1160: in the next house so to speak.
LINE 1161: —Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen
LINE 1162: assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.
LINE 1163: Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
LINE 1164: was overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of
LINE 1165: thing.
LINE 1166: —You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of
LINE 1167: conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely...
LINE 1168: All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad
LINE 1169: blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
LINE 1170: erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
LINE 1171: very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
LINE 1172: everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.
LINE 1173: —They accuse, remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who
LINE 1174: probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…
LINE 1175: —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of
LINE 1176: ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would
LINE 1177: you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
LINE 1178: inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
LINE 1179: an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer
LINE 1180: for, imported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper
LINE 1181: spirit. They are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to
LINE 1182: indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and
LINE 1183: then orthodox as you are. But in the economic, not touching religion,
LINE 1184: domain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war,
LINE 1185: compared with goahead America. Turks. It's in the dogma. Because if
LINE 1186: they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd
LINE 1187: try to live better, at least so I think. That's the juggle on which the
LINE 1188: p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed with dramatic
LINE 1189: force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the
LINE 1190: outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes
LINE 1191: _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion
LINE 1192: either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum. That's the
LINE 1193: vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of
LINE 1194: friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for
LINE 1195: what it's worth. I call that patriotism. _Ubi patria_, as we learned a
LINE 1196: smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_. Where
LINE 1197: you can live well, the sense is, if you work.
LINE 1198: Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
LINE 1199: synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
LINE 1200: He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
LINE 1201: crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
LINE 1202: of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
LINE 1203: beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
LINE 1204: didn't say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.
LINE 1205: —Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.
LINE 1206: The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
LINE 1207: who owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
LINE 1208: must work, have to, together.
LINE 1209: —I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
LINE 1210: possible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the
LINE 1211: thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
LINE 1212: nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little I
LINE 1213: know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
LINE 1214: entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit
LINE 1215: as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
LINE 1216: peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.
LINE 1217: Each is equally important.
LINE 1218: —You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may
LINE 1219: be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called
LINE 1220: Ireland for short.
LINE 1221: —I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.
LINE 1222: —But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
LINE 1223: because it belongs to me.
LINE 1224: —What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
LINE 1225: some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the
LINE 1226: latter portion. What was it you...?
LINE 1227: Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
LINE 1228: coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:
LINE 1229: —We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.
LINE 1230: At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
LINE 1231: down but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction
LINE 1232: to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some
LINE 1233: kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of his
LINE 1234: recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
LINE 1235: foreign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B
LINE 1236: attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he
LINE 1237: hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of
LINE 1238: fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an
LINE 1239: air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
LINE 1240: the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
LINE 1241: failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
LINE 1242: instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in
LINE 1243: the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For
LINE 1244: instance there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy
LINE 1245: faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad
LINE 1246: vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a
LINE 1247: nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously
LINE 1248: sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual
LINE 1249: _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed
LINE 1250: into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a
LINE 1251: strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so
LINE 1252: as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law
LINE 1253: amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not
LINE 1254: divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.
LINE 1255: Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly
LINE 1256: turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and
LINE 1257: the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in
LINE 1258: the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne,
LINE 1259: then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high
LINE 1260: personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state,
LINE 1261: he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running
LINE 1262: counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before
LINE 1263: under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good
LINE 1264: Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the
LINE 1265: reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women
LINE 1266: chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being
LINE 1267: largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like
LINE 1268: distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must,
LINE 1269: trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of
LINE 1270: a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned
LINE 1271: his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the
LINE 1272: cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a
LINE 1273: continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the
LINE 1274: other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest
LINE 1275: rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius,
LINE 1276: that. With brains, sir.
LINE 1277: For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
LINE 1278: to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
LINE 1279: not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad
LINE 1280: having in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the
LINE 1281: acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
LINE 1282: for reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,
LINE 1283: as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the
LINE 1284: mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance,
LINE 1285: row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,
LINE 1286: the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of
LINE 1287: the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth,
LINE 1288: viz. coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the
LINE 1289: microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he
LINE 1290: might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy
LINE 1291: if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the
LINE 1292: common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea
LINE 1293: per column. _My Experiences_, let us say, _in a Cabman's Shelter_.
LINE 1294: The pink edition extra sporting of the _Telegraph_ tell a graphic lie
LINE 1295: lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just
LINE 1296: puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and
LINE 1297: the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard
LINE 1298: was addressed A. Boudin find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly
LINE 1299: over the respective captions which came under his special province the
LINE 1300: allembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a
LINE 1301: start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du
LINE 1302: Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle,
LINE 1303: Tokio. Lovemaking in Irish, £ 200 damages. Gordon Bennett. Emigration
LINE 1304: Swindle. Letter from His Grace. William ✠. Ascot meeting, the Gold Cup.
LINE 1305: Victory of outsider _Throwaway_ recalls Derby of '92 when Capt.
LINE 1306: Marshall's dark horse _Sir Hugo_ captured the blue ribband at long
LINE 1307: odds. New York disaster. Thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral
LINE 1308: of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.
LINE 1309: So to change the subject he read about Dignam R. I. P. which, he
LINE 1310: reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address
LINE 1311: anyway.
LINE 1312: —_This morning_ (Hynes put it in of course) _the remains of the late Mr
LINE 1313: Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,
LINE 1314: Sandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a
LINE 1315: most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a
LINE 1316: brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom
LINE 1317: he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the
LINE 1318: deceased were present, were carried out_ (certainly Hynes wrote it with
LINE 1319: a nudge from Corny) _by Messrs H. J. O'Neill and Son, 164 North Strand
LINE 1320: Road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan
LINE 1321: (brother-in-law), Jno. Henry Menton, solr, Martin Cunningham, John
LINE 1322: Power, eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora_ (must be where he called
LINE 1323: Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad) _Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus,
LINE 1324: Stephen Dedalus B. A., Edw. J. Lambert, Cornelius T. Kelleher, Joseph
LINE 1325: M'C Hynes, L. Boom, C P M'Coy,—M'Intosh and several others_.
LINE 1326: Nettled not a little by L. _Boom_ (as it incorrectly stated) and the
LINE 1327: line of bitched type but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy
LINE 1328: and Stephen Dedalus B. A. who were conspicuous, needless to say, by
LINE 1329: their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh) L. Boom pointed it out
LINE 1330: to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn, half
LINE 1331: nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of
LINE 1332: misprints.
LINE 1333: —Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked as soon as his bottom
LINE 1334: jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.
LINE 1335: —It is. Really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to
LINE 1336: the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there
LINE 1337: could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and
LINE 1338: a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing to. There.
LINE 1339: While the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the
LINE 1340: nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits
LINE 1341: and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three,
LINE 1342: his side. Value 1000 sovs with 3000 sovs in specie added. For entire
LINE 1343: colts and fillies. Mr F. Alexander's _Throwaway_, b. h. by
LINE 1344: _Rightaway-Thrale_, 5 yrs, 9 st 4 lbs (W. Lane) 1. Lord Howard de
LINE 1345: Walden's _Zinfandel_ (M. Cannon) 2. Mr W. Bass's _Sceptre_ 3. Betting 5
LINE 1346: to 4 on _Zinfandel_, 20 to 1 _Throwaway_ (off). _Sceptre_ a shade
LINE 1347: heavier. It was anybody's race then the rank outsider drew to the fore,
LINE 1348: got long lead, beating Lord Howard de Walden's chestnut colt and Mr W.
LINE 1349: Bass's bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. Winner trained by
LINE 1350: Braime so that Lenehan's version of the business was all pure buncombe.
LINE 1351: Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. 1000 sovs with 3000 in
LINE 1352: specie. Also ran: J de Bremond's (French horse Bantam Lyons was
LINE 1353: anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute) _Maximum
LINE 1354: II_. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though
LINE 1355: that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get
LINE 1356: left. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing
LINE 1357: though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn't much reason to
LINE 1358: congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it
LINE 1359: reduced itself to eventually.
LINE 1360: —There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.
LINE 1361: —Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.
LINE 1362: One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:
LINE 1363: _Return of Parnell_. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was
LINE 1364: in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it
LINE 1365: was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for
LINE 1366: a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with
LINE 1367: no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone
LINE 1368: down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his
LINE 1369: senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they
LINE 1370: brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the
LINE 1371: Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and
LINE 1372: so on.
LINE 1373: All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
LINE 1374: memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
LINE 1375: not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
LINE 1376: was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
LINE 1377: of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
LINE 1378: inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in
LINE 1379: his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just
LINE 1380: when his various different political arrangements were nearing
LINE 1381: completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having
LINE 1382: neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold
LINE 1383: resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his
LINE 1384: room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a
LINE 1385: fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find
LINE 1386: the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted
LINE 1387: with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his
LINE 1388: whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order
LINE 1389: even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and
LINE 1390: Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within
LINE 1391: the bounds of possibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as
LINE 1392: a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure,
LINE 1393: a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged
LINE 1394: feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren't even a patch on
LINE 1395: the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were
LINE 1396: very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with
LINE 1397: feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on
LINE 1398: him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You
LINE 1399: had to come back. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the
LINE 1400: understudy in the title _rôle_ how to. He saw him once on the
LINE 1401: auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_
LINE 1402: or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in
LINE 1403: point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he
LINE 1404: said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid
LINE 1405: exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the
LINE 1406: cup and the lip: what's bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You
LINE 1407: were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got
LINE 1408: back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and
LINE 1409: Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in
LINE 1410: possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the
LINE 1411: Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat's name to
LINE 1412: the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence
LINE 1413: went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew
LINE 1414: was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some
LINE 1415: pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description
LINE 1416: given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or
LINE 1417: some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said to
LINE 1418: the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under
LINE 1419: discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land
LINE 1420: first.
LINE 1421: —That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
LINE 1422: commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.
LINE 1423: —Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry
LINE 1424: Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man's thighs.
LINE 1425: I seen her picture in a barber's. The husband was a captain or an
LINE 1426: officer.
LINE 1427: —Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.
LINE 1428: This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
LINE 1429: amount of laughter among his _entourage_. As regards Bloom he, without
LINE 1430: the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the
LINE 1431: door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused
LINE 1432: extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters
LINE 1433: worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed
LINE 1434: between them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic
LINE 1435: till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till
LINE 1436: bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of
LINE 1437: the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not
LINE 1438: a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his
LINE 1439: downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to
LINE 1440: anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed
LINE 1441: into. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared
LINE 1442: favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the
LINE 1443: rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared
LINE 1444: her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went
LINE 1445: through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape
LINE 1446: of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a
LINE 1447: particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment
LINE 1448: with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained
LINE 1449: admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the
LINE 1450: lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the
LINE 1451: simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not
LINE 1452: being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the
LINE 1453: name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of
LINE 1454: weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home
LINE 1455: ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal
LINE 1456: question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real
LINE 1457: love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist
LINE 1458: between married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs
LINE 1459: absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of
LINE 1460: folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented
LINE 1461: obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military
LINE 1462: supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my
LINE 1463: gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th
LINE 1464: hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader,
LINE 1465: that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course,
LINE 1466: woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame
LINE 1467: which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the
LINE 1468: gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved
LINE 1469: evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts
LINE 1470: of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that
LINE 1471: exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his
LINE 1472: matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in
LINE 1473: the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a
LINE 1474: retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then
LINE 1475: coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without
LINE 1476: saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the
LINE 1477: times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not
LINE 1478: been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as
LINE 1479: it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south,
LINE 1480: however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
LINE 1481: simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
LINE 1482: very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
LINE 1483: wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
LINE 1484: every shred of decency to the winds.
LINE 1485: —Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
LINE 1486: Stephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don't greatly mistake she
LINE 1487: was Spanish too.
LINE 1488: —The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
LINE 1489: other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
LINE 1490: the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
LINE 1491: so many.
LINE 1492: —Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
LINE 1493: means, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it
LINE 1494: was as she lived there. So, Spain.
LINE 1495: Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him
LINE 1496: by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out
LINE 1497: his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained
LINE 1498: rapidly finally he.
LINE 1499: —Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
LINE 1500: photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?
LINE 1501: Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
LINE 1502: sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
LINE 1503: was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
LINE 1504: low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
LINE 1505: vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth,
LINE 1506: standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which
LINE 1507: was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all
LINE 1508: the vogue. Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about
LINE 1509: to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland
LINE 1510: street, Dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the
LINE 1511: esthetic execution.
LINE 1512: —Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom
LINE 1513: indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like
LINE 1514: her then.
LINE 1515: Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his
LINE 1516: legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major
LINE 1517: Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a
LINE 1518: singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered
LINE 1519: barely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in
LINE 1520: expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a
LINE 1521: lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage
LINE 1522: in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for
LINE 1523: the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt,
LINE 1524: being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in
LINE 1525: general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that
LINE 1526: afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as
LINE 1527: works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original,
LINE 1528: shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it
LINE 1529: does though, Saint Joseph's sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne
LINE 1530: toi trop. Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn't art in a
LINE 1531: word.
LINE 1532: The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's
LINE 1533: good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to
LINE 1534: speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the
LINE 1535: beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in
LINE 1536: itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was
LINE 1537: scarcely professional etiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort
LINE 1538: of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for
LINE 1539: sunshine after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there and then to
LINE 1540: follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by
LINE 1541: moving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly
LINE 1542: soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear
LINE 1543: however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further
LINE 1544: increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her
LINE 1545: symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_. In fact the slight soiling was only
LINE 1546: an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new,
LINE 1547: much better in fact with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?
LINE 1548: I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely
LINE 1549: as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning
LINE 1550: littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses
LINE 1551: (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately
LINE 1552: beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.
LINE 1553: The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated,
LINE 1554: _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of
LINE 1555: the bunch though you wouldn't think he had it in him yet you would.
LINE 1556: Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it
LINE 1557: was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An
LINE 1558: awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a
LINE 1559: lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same
LINE 1560: old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or
LINE 1561: the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about
LINE 1562: the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment
LINE 1563: sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the
LINE 1564: public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy
LINE 1565: and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they
LINE 1566: openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside
LINE 1567: hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in
LINE 1568: due course intimate. Then the decree _nisi_ and the King's proctor
LINE 1569: tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made
LINE 1570: absolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they
LINE 1571: largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they
LINE 1572: very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor
LINE 1573: who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B,
LINE 1574: enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the
LINE 1575: flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen
LINE 1576: leader's, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when
LINE 1577: clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader's) trusty henchmen to the
LINE 1578: number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated
LINE 1579: into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United
LINE 1580: Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up
LINE 1581: the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of
LINE 1582: some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite
LINE 1583: scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile
LINE 1584: tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man he
LINE 1585: was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with
LINE 1586: that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the
LINE 1587: shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that
LINE 1588: their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which
LINE 1589: she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot
LINE 1590: times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a
LINE 1591: nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated
LINE 1592: lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a
LINE 1593: grave character. His hat (Parnell's) a silk one was inadvertently
LINE 1594: knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who
LINE 1595: picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to
LINE 1596: return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity)
LINE 1597: who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat
LINE 1598: at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the
LINE 1599: country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos
LINE 1600: of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone instilled into
LINE 1601: him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good
LINE 1602: form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and
LINE 1603: thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in
LINE 1604: a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal
LINE 1605: profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the
LINE 1606: course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after
LINE 1607: the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory
LINE 1608: after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.
LINE 1609: On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes
LINE 1610: of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
LINE 1611: immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
LINE 1612: wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
LINE 1613: for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
LINE 1614: husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter
LINE 1615: from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the
LINE 1616: crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms,
LINE 1617: drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a
LINE 1618: domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord
LINE 1619: and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
LINE 1620: receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would
LINE 1621: overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes
LINE 1622: though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as
LINE 1623: quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a
LINE 1624: sceptical bias, believed and didn't make the smallest bones about
LINE 1625: saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging
LINE 1626: around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the
LINE 1627: best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the
LINE 1628: sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of
LINE 1629: wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to
LINE 1630: press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being
LINE 1631: that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_
LINE 1632: between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty
LINE 1633: and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine
LINE 1634: infatuation proved up to the hilt.
LINE 1635: It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
LINE 1636: brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
LINE 1637: with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last
LINE 1638: him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day
LINE 1639: take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the
LINE 1640: interim ladies' society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the
LINE 1641: gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump
LINE 1642: Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular
LINE 1643: lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as
LINE 1644: to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl
LINE 1645: courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to
LINE 1646: their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of
LINE 1647: complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and
LINE 1648: flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some
LINE 1649: landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The
LINE 1650: queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who
LINE 1651: was several years the other's senior or like his father but something
LINE 1652: substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made
LINE 1653: on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty
LINE 1654: Dumpty boiled.
LINE 1655: —At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired
LINE 1656: though unwrinkled face.
LINE 1657: —Some time yesterday, Stephen said.
LINE 1658: —Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
LINE 1659: Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!
LINE 1660: —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.
LINE 1661: Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.
LINE 1662: Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
LINE 1663: somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
LINE 1664: one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some
LINE 1665: score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to
LINE 1666: parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
LINE 1667: retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a
LINE 1668: sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the
LINE 1669: evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely
LINE 1670: in people's mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a
LINE 1671: copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which
LINE 1672: wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all
LINE 1673: events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the
LINE 1674: trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his
LINE 1675: mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted
LINE 1676: with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he
LINE 1677: at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he
LINE 1678: strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion
LINE 1679: by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that
LINE 1680: he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
LINE 1681: mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him
LINE 1682: (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
LINE 1683: themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
LINE 1684: invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
LINE 1685: and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
LINE 1686: fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.
LINE 1687: Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
LINE 1688: was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was
LINE 1689: a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
LINE 1690: (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
LINE 1691: altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
LINE 1692: unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
LINE 1693: the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
LINE 1694: very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the
LINE 1695: other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
LINE 1696: or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which
LINE 1697: of the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved
LINE 1698: him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things
LINE 1699: considered. His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or
LINE 1700: not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't
LINE 1701: what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried
LINE 1702: him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly,
LINE 1703: supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very
LINE 1704: great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in
LINE 1705: his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up
LINE 1706: by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of
LINE 1707: Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two
LINE 1708: and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands
LINE 1709: and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast
LINE 1710: amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort
LINE 1711: was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the
LINE 1712: grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't
LINE 1713: appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly
LINE 1714: beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse
LINE 1715: of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would
LINE 1716: be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few
LINE 1717: days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with
LINE 1718: sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to
LINE 1719: freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized
LINE 1720: charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment
LINE 1721: of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for
LINE 1722: as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as
LINE 1723: Mr Algebra remarks _passim_. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over
LINE 1724: his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being
LINE 1725: a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what
LINE 1726: properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point
LINE 1727: too of tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they
LINE 1728: appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts
LINE 1729: in the county Sligo.
LINE 1730: —I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
LINE 1731: prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here you just come
LINE 1732: home with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the
LINE 1733: vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I'll
LINE 1734: just pay this lot.
LINE 1735: The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
LINE 1736: sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the
LINE 1737: keeper of the shanty who didn't seem to.
LINE 1738: —Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of
LINE 1739: that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.
LINE 1740: All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B's) busy brain,
LINE 1741: education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
LINE 1742: up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
LINE 1743: with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
LINE 1744: with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
LINE 1745: things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from
LINE 1746: the housetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was
LINE 1747: wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to
LINE 1748: bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be
LINE 1749: just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the
LINE 1750: direction of that particular red herring just to.
LINE 1751: The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former
LINE 1752: viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association
LINE 1753: dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this
LINE 1754: thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who
LINE 1755: appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony
LINE 1756: MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to
LINE 1757: that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered
LINE 1758: why.
LINE 1759: —Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
LINE 1760: put in, manifesting some natural impatience.
LINE 1761: —And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.
LINE 1762: The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
LINE 1763: which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.
LINE 1764: —Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
LINE 1765: queried.
LINE 1766: —Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a
LINE 1767: bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
LINE 1768: portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.
LINE 1769: Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the
LINE 1770: dark, manner of speaking. _The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my
LINE 1771: favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._
LINE 1772: Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
LINE 1773: found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
LINE 1774: hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
LINE 1775: time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
LINE 1776: loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
LINE 1777: him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
LINE 1778: sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
LINE 1779: that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
LINE 1780: remark.
LINE 1781: To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
LINE 1782: to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
LINE 1783: and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
LINE 1784: the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
LINE 1785: host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
LINE 1786: not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
LINE 1787: grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four
LINE 1788: coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
LINE 1789: spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
LINE 1790: in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
LINE 1791: worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.
LINE 1792: —Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.
LINE 1793: Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
LINE 1794: shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and
LINE 1795: company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their
LINE 1796: _dolce far niente_. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and
LINE 1797: fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.
LINE 1798: —One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of
LINE 1799: the moment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs
LINE 1800: upside down, on the tables in cafés. To which impromptu the
LINE 1801: neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying
LINE 1802: straight off:
LINE 1803: —To sweep the floor in the morning.
LINE 1804: So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
LINE 1805: time apologetic to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the
LINE 1806: bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The
LINE 1807: night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
LINE 1808: weak on his pins.
LINE 1809: —It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a
LINE 1810: moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man.
LINE 1811: Come. It's not far. Lean on me.
LINE 1812: Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on
LINE 1813: accordingly.
LINE 1814: —Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange
LINE 1815: kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and
LINE 1816: all that.
LINE 1817: Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the
LINE 1818: municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
LINE 1819: purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
LINE 1820: of fresh fields and pastures new. And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the
LINE 1821: analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
LINE 1822: part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
LINE 1823: time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
LINE 1824: selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.
LINE 1825: So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
LINE 1826: Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
LINE 1827: tracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though
LINE 1828: confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to
LINE 1829: follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's _Huguenots_,
LINE 1830: Meyerbeer's _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart's _Twelfth Mass_
LINE 1831: he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the
LINE 1832: acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else
LINE 1833: into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the
LINE 1834: catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line
LINE 1835: such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live
LINE 1836: thy protestant to be_. He also yielded to none in his admiration of
LINE 1837: Rossini's _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers,
LINE 1838: in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable
LINE 1839: sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and
LINE 1840: putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers' church
LINE 1841: in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the
LINE 1842: doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather. There was the
LINE 1843: unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it
LINE 1844: to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was
LINE 1845: a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole though favouring
LINE 1846: preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_,
LINE 1847: a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface
LINE 1848: knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And
LINE 1849: talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old
LINE 1850: favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel's air in _Martha,
LINE 1851: M'appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be
LINE 1852: more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from
LINE 1853: the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of
LINE 1854: the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.
LINE 1855: Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't sing it but
LINE 1856: launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or
LINE 1857: about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near
LINE 1858: Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an
LINE 1859: instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch,
LINE 1860: whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded
LINE 1861: familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_
LINE 1862: and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he
LINE 1863: said, in the Queen's chapel or anywhere else he found them and one
LINE 1864: Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.
LINE 1865: On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
LINE 1866: the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
LINE 1867: brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
LINE 1868: perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to
LINE 1869: sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the
LINE 1870: political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical
LINE 1871: names, as a striking coincidence.
LINE 1872: By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving,
LINE 1873: Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other's
LINE 1874: sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:
LINE 1875: —Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.
LINE 1876: They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
LINE 1877: anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
LINE 1878: near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even
LINE 1879: flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a
LINE 1880: blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot
LINE 1881: foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with
LINE 1882: his thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn't a lump
LINE 1883: of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared
LINE 1884: for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big nervous
LINE 1885: foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But
LINE 1886: even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the
LINE 1887: same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal's fault
LINE 1888: in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the
LINE 1889: desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them
LINE 1890: all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring
LINE 1891: the bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of
LINE 1892: his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my
LINE 1893: eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field
LINE 1894: occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen's words while the
LINE 1895: ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly
LINE 1896: interesting old.
LINE 1897: —What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in
LINE 1898: medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
LINE 1899: acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.
LINE 1900: He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
LINE 1901: image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
LINE 1902: blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after
LINE 1903: as he was perhaps not that way built.
LINE 1904: Still, supposing he had his father's gift as he more than suspected, it
LINE 1905: opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall's Irish
LINE 1906: industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in
LINE 1907: general.
LINE 1908: Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has
LINE 1909: End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows
LINE 1910: come from. Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_
LINE 1911: about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men,
LINE 1912: which boggled Bloom a bit:
LINE 1913: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
LINE 1914: Tun die Poeten dichten.
LINE 1915: These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_. Bloom, nodding,
LINE 1916: said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
LINE 1917: he did.
LINE 1918: A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
LINE 1919: which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could
LINE 1920: easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice
LINE 1921: production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the
LINE 1922: bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and
LINE 1923: procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into
LINE 1924: fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial
LINE 1925: magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his
LINE 1926: university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly
LINE 1927: bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would
LINE 1928: infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which
LINE 1929: also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his
LINE 1930: clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into
LINE 1931: their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society's sartorial
LINE 1932: niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate
LINE 1933: against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily
LINE 1934: foresee him participating in their musical and artistic
LINE 1935: _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for
LINE 1936: choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and
LINE 1937: being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he
LINE 1938: happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away,
LINE 1939: he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added
LINE 1940: to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be
LINE 1941: sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he
LINE 1942: parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily
LINE 1943: embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of
LINE 1944: time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and
LINE 1945: both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity
LINE 1946: in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a
LINE 1947: cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though
LINE 1948: taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that,
LINE 1949: different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue
LINE 1950: as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the
LINE 1951: usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public
LINE 1952: by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_. Yes,
LINE 1953: beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and
LINE 1954: he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high
LINE 1955: place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and,
LINE 1956: booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street
LINE 1957: house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs,
LINE 1958: so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort
LINE 1959: to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too
LINE 1960: much fêted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the
LINE 1961: other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time
LINE 1962: to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing
LINE 1963: without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything
LINE 1964: derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he
LINE 1965: had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other,
LINE 1966: possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort,
LINE 1967: hung on to him at all.
LINE 1968: The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he
LINE 1969: purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on
LINE 1970: the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his
LINE 1971: connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
LINE 1972: prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
LINE 1973: pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call
LINE 1974: it which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side
LINE 1975: of a person's character, no pun intended.
LINE 1976: The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted
LINE 1977: and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting
LINE 1978: fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three
LINE 1979: smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a
LINE 1980: full crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she)
LINE 1981: had ended, patient in his scythed car.
LINE 1982: Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed
LINE 1983: through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
LINE 1984: over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
LINE 1985: Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.
LINE 1986: Und alle Schiffe brücken.
LINE 1987: The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
LINE 1988: watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black,
LINE 1989: one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by
LINE 1990: Father Maher_. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again
LINE 1991: continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out
LINE 1992: of) about sirens, enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of
LINE 1993: other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the
LINE 1994: kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in
LINE 1995: the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they
LINE 1996: were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner
LINE 1997: street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.
