LINE 1: Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
LINE 2: He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
LINE 3: liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods' roes. Most of all he
LINE 4: liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
LINE 5: faintly scented urine.
LINE 6: Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
LINE 7: her breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the
LINE 8: kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him
LINE 9: feel a bit peckish.
LINE 10: The coals were reddening.
LINE 11: Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn't like
LINE 12: her plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
LINE 13: the hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,
LINE 14: its spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked
LINE 15: stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.
LINE 16: —Mkgnao!
LINE 17: —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
LINE 18: The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
LINE 19: table, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch
LINE 20: my head. Prr.
LINE 21: Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:
LINE 22: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
LINE 23: tail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his
LINE 24: knees.
LINE 25: —Milk for the pussens, he said.
LINE 26: —Mrkgnao! the cat cried.
LINE 27: They call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we
LINE 28: understand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.
LINE 29: Cruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder
LINE 30: what I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.
LINE 31: —Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the
LINE 32: chookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.
LINE 33: —Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.
LINE 34: She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
LINE 35: and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits
LINE 36: narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to
LINE 37: the dresser, took the jug Hanlon's milkman had just filled for him,
LINE 38: poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.
LINE 39: —Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
LINE 40: He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
LINE 41: three times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they
LINE 42: can't mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or
LINE 43: kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.
LINE 44: He listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with
LINE 45: this drouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for
LINE 46: a mutton kidney at Buckley's. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.
LINE 47: Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz's. While the kettle is boiling. She
LINE 48: lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so
LINE 49: rough? To lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced
LINE 50: round him. No.
LINE 51: On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
LINE 52: the bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter
LINE 53: she likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
LINE 54: He said softly in the bare hall:
LINE 55: —I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
LINE 56: And when he had heard his voice say it he added:
LINE 57: —You don't want anything for breakfast?
LINE 58: A sleepy soft grunt answered:
LINE 59: —Mn.
LINE 60: No. She didn't want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
LINE 61: as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.
LINE 62: Must get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
LINE 63: Forgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for
LINE 64: it. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor's auction.
LINE 65: Got a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
LINE 66: Plevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I'm proud of it. Still
LINE 67: he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was
LINE 68: farseeing.
LINE 69: His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
LINE 70: and his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback
LINE 71: pictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.
LINE 72: The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto's
LINE 73: high grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White
LINE 74: slip of paper. Quite safe.
LINE 75: On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.
LINE 76: In the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky
LINE 77: wardrobe. No use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He
LINE 78: pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf
LINE 79: dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right
LINE 80: till I come back anyhow.
LINE 81: He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
LINE 82: seventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George's church. Be a
LINE 83: warm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black
LINE 84: conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn't go in
LINE 85: that light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as
LINE 86: he walked in happy warmth. Boland's breadvan delivering with trays our
LINE 87: daily but she prefers yesterday's loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.
LINE 88: Makes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
LINE 89: dawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day's march on him.
LINE 90: Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a
LINE 91: strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker
LINE 92: too, old Tweedy's big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.
LINE 93: Wander through awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of
LINE 94: carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking
LINE 95: a coiled pipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented
LINE 96: with fennel, sherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two.
LINE 97: Well, meet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among
LINE 98: the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees,
LINE 99: signal, the evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches
LINE 100: me from her doorway. She calls her children home in their dark
LINE 101: language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet,
LINE 102: colour of Molly's new garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of
LINE 103: those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.
LINE 104: Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track
LINE 105: of the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.
LINE 106: What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_
LINE 107: leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway
LINE 108: behind the bank of Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch
LINE 109: that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.
LINE 110: He approached Larry O'Rourke's. From the cellar grating floated up the
LINE 111: flabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
LINE 112: whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the
LINE 113: end of the city traffic. For instance M'Auley's down there: n. g. as
LINE 114: position. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular
LINE 115: from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.
LINE 116: Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an
LINE 117: ad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my
LINE 118: bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
LINE 119: the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him
LINE 120: off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I'm going to
LINE 121: tell you? What's that, Mr O'Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,
LINE 122: they'd only be an eight o'clock breakfast for the Japanese.
LINE 123: Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor
LINE 124: Dignam, Mr O'Rourke.
LINE 125: Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
LINE 126: doorway:
LINE 127: —Good day, Mr O'Rourke.
LINE 128: —Good day to you.
LINE 129: —Lovely weather, sir.
LINE 130: —'Tis all that.
LINE 131: Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the
LINE 132: county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and
LINE 133: behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think
LINE 134: of the competition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin
LINE 135: without passing a pub. Save it they can't. Off the drunks perhaps. Put
LINE 136: down three and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs
LINE 137: and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with
LINE 138: the town travellers. Square it you with the boss and we'll split the
LINE 139: job, see?
LINE 140: How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels
LINE 141: of stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint
LINE 142: Joseph's National school. Brats' clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps
LINE 143: memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee
LINE 144: doubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At
LINE 145: their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.
LINE 146: He halted before Dlugacz's window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
LINE 147: polonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened
LINE 148: in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,
LINE 149: packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
LINE 150: lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs' blood.
LINE 151: A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He
LINE 152: stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too,
LINE 153: calling the items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a
LINE 154: pound and a half of Denny's sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous
LINE 155: hips. Woods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New
LINE 156: blood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on
LINE 157: the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked
LINE 158: skirt swings at each whack.
LINE 159: The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
LINE 160: blotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
LINE 161: He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
LINE 162: Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter
LINE 163: sanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round
LINE 164: it, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:
LINE 165: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
LINE 166: rustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
LINE 167: beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
LINE 168: breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a
LINE 169: palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there's a prime one, unpeeled
LINE 170: switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his
LINE 171: senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt
LINE 172: swinging, whack by whack by whack.
LINE 173: The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
LINE 174: sausages and made a red grimace.
LINE 175: —Now, my miss, he said.
LINE 176: She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.
LINE 177: —Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,
LINE 178: please?
LINE 179: Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
LINE 180: slowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the
LINE 181: morning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood
LINE 182: outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He
LINE 183: sighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted
LINE 184: toenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways. The
LINE 185: sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For
LINE 186: another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles' Lane. They like
LINE 187: them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I'm lost in the
LINE 188: wood.
LINE 189: —Threepence, please.
LINE 190: His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.
LINE 191: Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid them
LINE 192: on the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
LINE 193: disc by disc, into the till.
LINE 194: —Thank you, sir. Another time.
LINE 195: A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze
LINE 196: after an instant. No: better not: another time.
LINE 197: —Good morning, he said, moving away.
LINE 198: —Good morning, sir.
LINE 199: No sign. Gone. What matter?
LINE 200: He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
LINE 201: planters' company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
LINE 202: government and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel
LINE 203: and construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.
LINE 204: You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with
LINE 205: olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need
LINE 206: artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your
LINE 207: name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten
LINE 208: down and the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34,
LINE 209: Berlin, W. 15.
LINE 210: Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.
LINE 211: He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered
LINE 212: olivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in
LINE 213: jars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out.
LINE 214: Knows the taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.
LINE 215: Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin's parade. And
LINE 216: Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in
LINE 217: Citron's basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand,
LINE 218: lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet,
LINE 219: wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high
LINE 220: prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant
LINE 221: old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain,
LINE 222: Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside
LINE 223: at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them
LINE 224: barefoot in soiled dungarees. There's whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do
LINE 225: you? Doesn't see. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back
LINE 226: is like that Norwegian captain's. Wonder if I'll meet him today.
LINE 227: Watering cart. To provoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.
LINE 228: A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.
LINE 229: No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead
LINE 230: sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift
LINE 231: those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called
LINE 232: it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All
LINE 233: dead names. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore
LINE 234: the oldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy's,
LINE 235: clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far
LINE 236: away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying,
LINE 237: being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more.
LINE 238: Dead: an old woman's: the grey sunken cunt of the world.
LINE 239: Desolation.
LINE 240: Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he
LINE 241: turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his
LINE 242: veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I
LINE 243: am here now. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong
LINE 244: side of the bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. On the
LINE 245: hands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why
LINE 246: is that? Valuation is only twentyeight. Towers, Battersby, North,
LINE 247: MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore
LINE 248: eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling
LINE 249: butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.
LINE 250: Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
LINE 251: sandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a
LINE 252: girl with gold hair on the wind.
LINE 253: Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered
LINE 254: them. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.
LINE 255: Mrs Marion.
LINE 256: —Poldy!
LINE 257: Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
LINE 258: yellow twilight towards her tousled head.
LINE 259: —Who are the letters for?
LINE 260: He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.
LINE 261: —A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And
LINE 262: a letter for you.
LINE 263: He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of
LINE 264: her knees.
LINE 265: —Do you want the blind up?
LINE 266: Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
LINE 267: glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
LINE 268: —That do? he asked, turning.
LINE 269: She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
LINE 270: —She got the things, she said.
LINE 271: He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
LINE 272: slowly with a snug sigh.
LINE 273: —Hurry up with that tea, she said. I'm parched.
LINE 274: —The kettle is boiling, he said.
LINE 275: But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
LINE 276: linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
LINE 277: As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
LINE 278: —Poldy!
LINE 279: —What?
LINE 280: —Scald the teapot.
LINE 281: On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded
LINE 282: and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting
LINE 283: the kettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took
LINE 284: off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the
LINE 285: lump of butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat
LINE 286: mewed hungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won't mouse. Say
LINE 287: they won't eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall
LINE 288: to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper.
LINE 289: He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
LINE 290: Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:
LINE 291: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan's
LINE 292: seaside girls.
LINE 293: The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,
LINE 294: smiling. Silly Milly's birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait:
LINE 295: four. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of
LINE 296: folded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.
LINE 297: O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
LINE 298: You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
LINE 299: I'd rather have you without a farthing
LINE 300: Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.
LINE 301: Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous
LINE 302: old chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And
LINE 303: the little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the
LINE 304: parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin's hat! All we
LINE 305: laughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
LINE 306: He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
LINE 307: teapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it?
LINE 308: Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it
LINE 309: upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
LINE 310: Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it
LINE 311: on the chair by the bedhead.
LINE 312: —What a time you were! she said.
LINE 313: She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
LINE 314: the pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large
LINE 315: soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat's udder. The
LINE 316: warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance
LINE 317: of the tea she poured.
LINE 318: A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the
LINE 319: act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
LINE 320: —Who was the letter from? he asked.
LINE 321: Bold hand. Marion.
LINE 322: —O, Boylan, she said. He's bringing the programme.
LINE 323: —What are you singing?
LINE 324: —_Là ci darem_ with J. C. Doyle, she said, and _Love's Old Sweet Song_.
LINE 325: Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves
LINE 326: next day. Like foul flowerwater.
LINE 327: —Would you like the window open a little?
LINE 328: She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
LINE 329: —What time is the funeral?
LINE 330: —Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn't see the paper.
LINE 331: Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
LINE 332: drawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
LINE 333: stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.
LINE 334: —No: that book.
LINE 335: Other stocking. Her petticoat.
LINE 336: —It must have fell down, she said.
LINE 337: He felt here and there. _Voglio e non vorrei_. Wonder if she pronounces
LINE 338: that right: _voglio_. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped
LINE 339: and lifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of
LINE 340: the orangekeyed chamberpot.
LINE 341: —Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There's a word I wanted to
LINE 342: ask you.
LINE 343: She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
LINE 344: having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
LINE 345: text with the hairpin till she reached the word.
LINE 346: —Met him what? he asked.
LINE 347: —Here, she said. What does that mean?
LINE 348: He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.
LINE 349: —Metempsychosis?
LINE 350: —Yes. Who's he when he's at home?
LINE 351: —Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It's Greek: from the Greek. That
LINE 352: means the transmigration of souls.
LINE 353: —O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.
LINE 354: He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.
LINE 355: The first night after the charades. Dolphin's Barn. He turned over the
LINE 356: smudged pages. _Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_. Hello. Illustration.
LINE 357: Fierce Italian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the
LINE 358: floor naked. Sheet kindly lent. _The monster Maffei desisted and flung
LINE 359: his victim from him with an oath_. Cruelty behind it all. Doped
LINE 360: animals. Trapeze at Hengler's. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping.
LINE 361: Break your neck and we'll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them
LINE 362: young so they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That
LINE 363: a man's soul after he dies. Dignam's soul...
LINE 364: —Did you finish it? he asked.
LINE 365: —Yes, she said. There's nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the
LINE 366: first fellow all the time?
LINE 367: —Never read it. Do you want another?
LINE 368: —Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock's. Nice name he has.
LINE 369: She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.
LINE 370: Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they'll write to
LINE 371: Kearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that's the word.
LINE 372: —Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
LINE 373: after death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we
LINE 374: all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
LINE 375: planet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their
LINE 376: past lives.
LINE 377: The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better
LINE 378: remind her of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An
LINE 379: example?
LINE 380: The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed. Given away with the Easter number
LINE 381: of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you
LINE 382: put milk in. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six
LINE 383: I gave for the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked
LINE 384: nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.
LINE 385: He turned the pages back.
LINE 386: —Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They
LINE 387: used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
LINE 388: instance. What they called nymphs, for example.
LINE 389: Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,
LINE 390: inhaling through her arched nostrils.
LINE 391: —There's a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?
LINE 392: —The kidney! he cried suddenly.
LINE 393: He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
LINE 394: against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
LINE 395: hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork's legs. Pungent smoke
LINE 396: shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of
LINE 397: the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its
LINE 398: back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and
LINE 399: let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.
LINE 400: Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He
LINE 401: shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a
LINE 402: forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
LINE 403: meat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of
LINE 404: bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that
LINE 405: about some young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his
LINE 406: side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in
LINE 407: the gravy and raising it to his mouth.
LINE 408: Dearest Papli
LINE 409: Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me
LINE 410: splendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got
LINE 411: mummy's lovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am
LINE 412: getting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of
LINE 413: me and Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair
LINE 414: day and all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel
LINE 415: on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to
LINE 416: mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano
LINE 417: downstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.
LINE 418: There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
LINE 419: cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan's (I was on the
LINE 420: pop of writing Blazes Boylan's) song about those seaside girls. Tell
LINE 421: him silly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest
LINE 422: love
LINE 423: Your fond daughter
LINE 424: Milly
LINE 425: P. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby.
LINE 426: M.
LINE 427: Fifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first
LINE 428: birthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she
LINE 429: was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly
LINE 430: old woman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew
LINE 431: from the first poor little Rudy wouldn't live. Well, God is good, sir.
LINE 432: She knew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.
LINE 433: His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
LINE 434: Hurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the
LINE 435: XL Café about the bracelet. Wouldn't eat her cakes or speak or look.
LINE 436: Saucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece
LINE 437: after piece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she
LINE 438: might do worse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of
LINE 439: cooler tea to wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.
LINE 440: O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has
LINE 441: happened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild
LINE 442: piece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.
LINE 443: Ripening now. Vain: very.
LINE 444: He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught
LINE 445: her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a
LINE 446: little. Was given milk too long. On the _Erin's King_ that day round
LINE 447: the Kish. Damned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue
LINE 448: scarf loose in the wind with her hair.
LINE 449: All dimpled cheeks and curls,
LINE 450: Your head it simply swirls.
LINE 451: Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers' pockets,
LINE 452: jarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.
LINE 453: Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.
LINE 454: Those girls, those girls,
LINE 455: Those lovely seaside girls.
LINE 456: Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.
LINE 457: Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
LINE 458: braiding.
LINE 459: A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will
LINE 460: happen, yes. Prevent. Useless: can't move. Girl's sweet light lips.
LINE 461: Will happen too. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to
LINE 462: move now. Lips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman's lips.
LINE 463: Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass
LINE 464: the time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two
LINE 465: and six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or
LINE 466: through M'Coy.
LINE 467: The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
LINE 468: nosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.
LINE 469: Wants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her
LINE 470: wait. Has the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her
LINE 471: ear with her back to the fire too.
LINE 472: He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood
LINE 473: up, undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.
LINE 474: —Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I'm ready.
LINE 475: Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
LINE 476: landing.
LINE 477: A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as
LINE 478: I'm.
LINE 479: In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_. He folded it
LINE 480: under his armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in
LINE 481: soft bounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.
LINE 482: Listening, he heard her voice:
LINE 483: —Come, come, pussy. Come.
LINE 484: He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
LINE 485: towards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.
LINE 486: The maid was in the garden. Fine morning.
LINE 487: He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.
LINE 488: Make a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to
LINE 489: manure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.
LINE 490: All soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this
LINE 491: that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
LINE 492: dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are
LINE 493: fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid
LINE 494: gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in
LINE 495: that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still
LINE 496: gardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.
LINE 497: He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the
LINE 498: peg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don't remember that. Hallstand
LINE 499: too full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.
LINE 500: Drago's shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown
LINE 501: brillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder
LINE 502: have I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox
LINE 503: there got away James Stephens, they say. O'Brien.
LINE 504: Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.
LINE 505: Enthusiast.
LINE 506: He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to
LINE 507: get these trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head
LINE 508: under the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
LINE 509: limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he
LINE 510: peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his
LINE 511: countinghouse. Nobody.
LINE 512: Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
LINE 513: on his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a
LINE 514: bit. Our prize titbit: _Matcham's Masterstroke_. Written by Mr Philip
LINE 515: Beaufoy, Playgoers' Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a
LINE 516: column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds
LINE 517: three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.
LINE 518: Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding
LINE 519: but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding,
LINE 520: he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading
LINE 521: still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope
LINE 522: it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive.
LINE 523: One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or
LINE 524: touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now.
LINE 525: Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat
LINE 526: certainly. _Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won
LINE 527: the laughing witch who now_. Begins and ends morally. _Hand in hand_.
LINE 528: Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his
LINE 529: water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and
LINE 530: received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.
LINE 531: Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for
LINE 532: some proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what
LINE 533: she said dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving.
LINE 534: Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her.
LINE 535: 9.15. Did Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23.
LINE 536: What possessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I'm swelled after that
LINE 537: cabbage. A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.
LINE 538: Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning
LINE 539: after the bazaar dance when May's band played Ponchielli's dance of the
LINE 540: hours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
LINE 541: night hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
LINE 542: dancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
LINE 543: Why? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
LINE 544: humming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
LINE 545: mirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
LINE 546: vest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.
LINE 547: It wouldn't pan out somehow.
LINE 548: Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with
LINE 549: daggers and eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then
LINE 550: black. Still, true to life also. Day: then the night.
LINE 551: He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.
LINE 552: Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled
LINE 553: back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
LINE 554: into the air.
LINE 555: In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully
LINE 556: his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What
LINE 557: time is the funeral? Better find out in the paper.
LINE 558: A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George's
LINE 559: church. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.
LINE 560: Heigho! Heigho!
LINE 561: Heigho! Heigho!
LINE 562: Heigho! Heigho!
LINE 563: Quarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air. A
LINE 564: third.
LINE 565: Poor Dignam!
