LINE 6: Universally that person's acumen is esteemed very little perceptive
LINE 7: concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by
LINE 8: mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that

LINE 11: when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being

LINE 15: continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when
LINE 16: fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent
LINE 17: nature's incorrupted benefaction. For who is there who anything of some
LINE 18: significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior
LINE 19: splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or
LINE 20: on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive
LINE 21: that as no nature's boon can contend against the bounty of increase so
LINE 22: it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and
LINE 23: admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past
LINE 24: been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not
LINE 25: with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have
LINE 26: gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to
LINE 27: that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who
LINE 28: would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence

LINE 30: simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy
LINE 31: of abundance or with diminution's menace that exalted of reiteratedly
LINE 32: procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?
LINE 33: It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians
LINE 34: relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature
LINE 35: admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.
LINE 36: Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves,
LINE 37: their greatest doctors, the O'Shiels, the O'Hickeys, the O'Lees, have
LINE 38: sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the
LINE 39: relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling
LINE 40: withering or loose boyconnell flux. Certainly in every public work
LINE 41: which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with
LINE 42: importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted
LINE 43: (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it
LINE 44: is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent
LINE 45: inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest)
LINE 46: whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that
LINE 47: whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly
LINE 48: required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who
LINE 49: not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely
LINE 50: could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was
LINE 51: provided.
LINE 52: To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be
LINE 53: molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent
LINE 54: mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received
LINE 55: eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the
LINE 56: case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying
LINE 57: desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be
LINE 58: received into that domicile. O thing of prudent nation not merely in
LINE 59: being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that
LINE 60: they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly
LINE 61: to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt!
LINE 62: Before born bliss babe had. Within womb won he worship. Whatever in
LINE 63: that one case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended
LINE 64: with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though
LINE 65: forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no
LINE 66: less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are
LINE 67: pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting
LINE 68: spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together
LINE 69: with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct
LINE 70: females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright
LINE 71: wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and
LINE 72: reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.
LINE 73: Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night's oncoming. Of
LINE 74: Israel's folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark
LINE 75: ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.
LINE 76: Of that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming
LINE 77: mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale
LINE 78: so God's angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters
LINE 79: in ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve
LINE 80: moons thrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne
LINE 81: holding wariest ward.
LINE 82: In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising
LINE 83: with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping
LINE 84: lightens in eyeblink Ireland's westward welkin. Full she drad that God
LINE 85: the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.
LINE 86: Christ's rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe
LINE 87: infare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in
LINE 88: Horne's house.
LINE 89: Loth to irk in Horne's hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow
LINE 90: he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over
LINE 91: land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in
LINE 92: townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he
LINE 93: craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face,
LINE 94: hers, so young then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of
LINE 95: blushes his word winning.
LINE 96: As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad
LINE 97: after she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O'Hare Doctor
LINE 98: tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered
LINE 99: that O'Hare Doctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear
LINE 100: that him so heavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing
LINE 101: death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God's rightwiseness to
LINE 102: withsay. She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His
LINE 103: goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men's oil
LINE 104: to his limbs. The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death
LINE 105: the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was
LINE 106: died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas
LINE 107: and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his
LINE 108: undeathliness. He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring. So
LINE 109: stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.
LINE 110: Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the
LINE 111: dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came
LINE 112: naked forth from his mother's womb so naked shall he wend him at the
LINE 113: last for to go as he came.
LINE 114: The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman
LINE 115: and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in
LINE 116: childbed. The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in
LINE 117: throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to
LINE 118: bear but that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she
LINE 119: had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that
LINE 120: woman's birth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew
LINE 121: the man that time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to
LINE 122: her words for he felt with wonder women's woe in the travail that they
LINE 123: have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair
LINE 124: face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a
LINE 125: handmaid. Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.
LINE 126: And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there
LINE 127: nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there
LINE 128: came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept
LINE 129: Dixon. And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed
LINE 130: that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where
LINE 131: this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
LINE 132: healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
LINE 133: horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a
LINE 134: salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he
LINE 135: said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with
LINE 136: them that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
LINE 137: otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady
LINE 138: was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
LINE 139: that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But
LINE 140: the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
LINE 141: him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a
LINE 142: marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for
LINE 143: to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches
LINE 144: environing in divers lands and sometime venery.
LINE 145: And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
LINE 146: and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
LINE 147: move more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and
LINE 148: knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
LINE 149: flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
LINE 150: abound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic
LINE 151: of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that
LINE 152: he blases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was
LINE 153: on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there
LINE 154: was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay
LINE 155: strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be
LINE 156: possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these
LINE 157: fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of
LINE 158: the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And
LINE 159: also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a
LINE 160: compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of
LINE 161: certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like
LINE 162: to a vast mountain. And they teach the serpents there to entwine
LINE 163: themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
LINE 164: these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.
LINE 165: And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
LINE 166: thereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe
LINE 167: Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
LINE 168: in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
LINE 169: anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
LINE 170: his neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle
LINE 171: with them for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.
LINE 172: This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at
LINE 173: the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing
LINE 174: for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time
LINE 175: hied fast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered
LINE 176: what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he,
LINE 177: that it be not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware
LINE 178: and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was
LINE 179: older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights
LINE 180: virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
LINE 181: to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring
LINE 182: forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath
LINE 183: waited marvellous long. And the franklin that had drunken said,
LINE 184: Expecting each moment to be her next. Also he took the cup that stood
LINE 185: tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to
LINE 186: drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far
LINE 187: as he might to their both's health for he was a passing good man of his
LINE 188: lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat
LINE 189: in scholars' hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that
LINE 190: ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight
LINE 191: of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged
LINE 192: him courtly in the cup. Woman's woe with wonder pondering.
LINE 193: Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
LINE 194: drunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side
LINE 195: the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary
LINE 196: Merciable's with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of
LINE 197: medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,
LINE 198: one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at
LINE 199: head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long
LINE 200: of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young
LINE 201: Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and
LINE 202: beside the meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that
LINE 203: he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how
LINE 204: he had broke his avow. And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
LINE 205: friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that
LINE 206: his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as
LINE 207: they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner. Ruth red
LINE 208: him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.
LINE 209: For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each
LINE 210: gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining
LINE 211: that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen
LINE 212: out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne's house
LINE 213: that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next
LINE 214: before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her
LINE 215: case). And they said farther she should live because in the beginning,
LINE 216: they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that
LINE 217: were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for
LINE 218: he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young
LINE 219: Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it
LINE 220: was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the
LINE 221: law nor his judges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was
LINE 222: scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,
LINE 223: the wife should live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed
LINE 224: hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but
LINE 225: the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at
LINE 226: the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the
LINE 227: whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion
LINE 228: sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint
LINE 229: Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby
LINE 230: they were all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words
LINE 231: following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and
LINE 232: parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in
LINE 233: purgefire. But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
LINE 234: nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very
LINE 235: God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We
LINE 236: are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends
LINE 237: than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.
LINE 238: But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was
LINE 239: that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or
LINE 240: leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.
LINE 241: Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi's praise of that
LINE 242: beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the
LINE 243: other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they
LINE 244: did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his
LINE 245: engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
LINE 246: do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir
LINE 247: Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour
LINE 248: which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare
LINE 249: whoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
LINE 250: mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
LINE 251: of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
LINE 252: brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius
LINE 253: saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or
LINE 254: an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu
LINE 255: secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of
LINE 256: Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how at the end of the
LINE 257: second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother
LINE 258: foldeth ever souls for God's greater glory whereas that earthly mother
LINE 259: which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he
LINE 260: that holdeth the fisherman's seal, even that blessed Peter on which
LINE 261: rock was holy church for all ages founded. All they bachelors then
LINE 262: asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as
LINE 263: risk life to save life. A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted
LINE 264: all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that
LINE 265: as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a
LINE 266: layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an
LINE 267: accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had
LINE 268: birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their
LINE 269: questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant
LINE 270: word. Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he
LINE 271: averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he
LINE 272: was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that
LINE 273: taking it appeared eftsoons.
LINE 274: But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
LINE 275: pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
LINE 276: as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
LINE 277: manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
LINE 278: could save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart
LINE 279: for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
LINE 280: lamb's wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
LINE 281: lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir
LINE 282: Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him
LINE 283: his friend's son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness
LINE 284: and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for
LINE 285: all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
LINE 286: for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
LINE 287: murdered his goods with whores.
LINE 288: About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
LINE 289: so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
LINE 290: their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying
LINE 291: for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge
LINE 292: the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink
LINE 293: we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed
LINE 294: parcel of my body but my soul's bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to
LINE 295: them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for
LINE 296: this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he
LINE 297: showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the
LINE 298: worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song
LINE 299: which he writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such
LINE 300: dearth of money as was herebefore. His words were then these as
LINE 301: followeth: Know all men, he said, time's ruins build eternity's
LINE 302: mansions. What means this? Desire's wind blasts the thorntree but after
LINE 303: it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark
LINE 304: me now. In woman's womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the
LINE 305: maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.
LINE 306: This is the postcreation. _Omnis caro ad te veniet_. No question but
LINE 307: her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer,
LINE 308: Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and
LINE 309: Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae
LINE 310: supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is
LINE 311: the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other,
LINE 312: our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of
LINE 313: navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.
LINE 314: But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was
LINE 315: but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or
LINE 316: she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy
LINE 317: with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with
LINE 318: Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,
LINE 319: _parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l'avait mise dans cette
LINE 320: fichue position c'était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_
LINE 321: transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case
LINE 322: subsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. A
LINE 323: pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without
LINE 324: blemish, a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour
LINE 325: worship. With will will we withstand, withsay.
LINE 326: Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would
LINE 327: sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod
LINE 328: of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:
LINE 329: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse
LINE 330: Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was
LINE 331: it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all
LINE 332: orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no
LINE 333: gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an
LINE 334: ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in
LINE 335: habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
LINE 336: hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of
LINE 337: them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness
LINE 338: some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all
LINE 339: chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,
LINE 340: thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou
LINE 341: chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,
LINE 342: to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the
LINE 343: good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,
LINE 344: margerain gentle, advising also the time's occasion as most sacred and
LINE 345: most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne's house rest should reign.
LINE 346: To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
LINE 347: Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
LINE 348: had not cided to take friar's vows and he answered him obedience in the
LINE 349: womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master
LINE 350: Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
LINE 351: and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
LINE 352: of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
LINE 353: intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he
LINE 354: said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
LINE 355: the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more
LINE 356: and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing
LINE 357: and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,
LINE 358: she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,
LINE 359: with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries
LINE 360: and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
LINE 361: there unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
LINE 362: delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
LINE 363: in their _Maid's Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:
LINE 364: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable
LINE 365: concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most
LINE 366: mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous
LINE 367: flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium
LINE 368: of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,
LINE 369: but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
LINE 370: for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen
LINE 371: said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between
LINE 372: them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for
LINE 373: life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved
LINE 374: with it. Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay
LINE 375: down his wife for his friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words
LINE 376: to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French
LINE 377: letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to
LINE 378: whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it
LINE 379: will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. _Orate, fratres,
LINE 380: pro memetipso_. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy
LINE 381: generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by
LINE 382: my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication
LINE 383: in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou
LINE 384: sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
LINE 385: servants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why
LINE 386: hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for
LINE 387: a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian
LINE 388: of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth
LINE 389: now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo
LINE 390: and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with
LINE 391: milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon
LINE 392: and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for
LINE 393: ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast
LINE 394: thou kissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to
LINE 395: say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much
LINE 396: as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell's gates
LINE 397: visited a darkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates
LINE 398: atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father
LINE 399: showeth the prince no blister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon
LINE 400: of life is an Egypt's plague which in the nights of prenativity and
LINE 401: postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_. And as the ends
LINE 402: and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their
LINE 403: inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads
LINE 404: forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis
LINE 405: that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto
LINE 406: nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into
LINE 407: life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over
LINE 408: us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among
LINE 409: bulrushes, a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a
LINE 410: mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat
LINE 411: and the ossifrage. And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor
LINE 412: to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or
LINE 413: to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see
LINE 414: from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched
LINE 415: his whenceness.
LINE 416: Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he
LINE 417: loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast
LINE 418: majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all
LINE 419: in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.
LINE 420: Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack
LINE 421: See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,
LINE 422: In the proud cirque of Jackjohn's bivouac.
LINE 423: A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on
LINE 424: left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the
LINE 425: storm that hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to
LINE 426: flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and
LINE 427: paganry. And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as
LINE 428: they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before
LINE 429: so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart
LINE 430: shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that
LINE 431: storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard
LINE 432: again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he
LINE 433: was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But the
LINE 434: braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was
LINE 435: muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was
LINE 436: only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne's hall. He
LINE 437: drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it
LINE 438: thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden,
LINE 439: being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of
LINE 440: doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart's side, spoke to him calming
LINE 441: words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing
LINE 442: but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the
LINE 443: thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a
LINE 444: natural phenomenon.
LINE 445: But was young Boasthard's fear vanquished by Calmer's words? No, for he
LINE 446: had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
LINE 447: done away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
LINE 448: other? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But
LINE 449: could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
LINE 450: bottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not
LINE 451: there to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
LINE 452: god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?
LINE 453: Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
LINE 454: Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw
LINE 455: that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one
LINE 456: day die as he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not
LINE 457: accept to die like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though
LINE 458: he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives
LINE 459: which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted
LINE 460: he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the
LINE 461: land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for
LINE 462: ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering
LINE 463: at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told
LINE 464: him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason
LINE 465: was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing
LINE 466: exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him
LINE 467: wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as,
LINE 468: Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave
LINE 469: place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot
LINE 470: which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal
LINE 471: Concupiscence.
LINE 472: This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of
LINE 473: Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore
LINE 474: Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
LINE 475: wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
LINE 476: know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but
LINE 477: notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,
LINE 478: Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and
LINE 479: in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words
LINE 480: printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by
LINE 481: Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they
LINE 482: cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of
LINE 483: oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring
LINE 484: that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was
LINE 485: named Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr
LINE 486: Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,
LINE 487: Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,
LINE 488: were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a
LINE 489: very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill
LINE 490: their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them
LINE 491: contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.
LINE 492: So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and
LINE 493: after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a
LINE 494: fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won't sprout, fields
LINE 495: athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.
LINE 496: Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without
LINE 497: sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without. The
LINE 498: rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought
LINE 499: but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world
LINE 500: saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that
LINE 501: did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.
LINE 502: But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in
LINE 503: the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and
LINE 504: the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first
LINE 505: and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder
LINE 506: and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the
LINE 507: smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or
LINE 508: kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the
LINE 509: pour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke's lawn, thence through
LINE 510: Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was
LINE 511: before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no
LINE 512: more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice
LINE 513: Fitzgibbon's door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the
LINE 514: college lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman's gentleman that had but come
LINE 515: from Mr Moore's the writer's (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a
LINE 516: good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are
LINE 517: now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from
LINE 518: Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M's brother will stay a
LINE 519: month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,
LINE 520: he bound home and he to Andrew Horne's being stayed for to crush a cup
LINE 521: of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of
LINE 522: her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and
LINE 523: so both together on to Horne's. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford's journal
LINE 524: sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon
LINE 525: jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy's, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.
LINE 526: Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.
LINE 527: Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having
LINE 528: dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers
LINE 529: on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be
LINE 530: for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading
LINE 531: her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term,
LINE 532: the midwives sore put to it and can't deliver, she queasy for a bowl of
LINE 533: riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very
LINE 534: heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they
LINE 535: say, but God give her soon issue. 'Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear,
LINE 536: and Lady day bit off her last chick's nails that was then a twelvemonth
LINE 537: and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand
LINE 538: in the king's bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the
LINE 539: sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys
LINE 540: off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in
LINE 541: a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag,
LINE 542: I hear. In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and
LINE 543: will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and
LINE 544: water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi's almanac (and I
LINE 545: hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out
LINE 546: of the Hindustanish for his farmer's gazette) to have three things in
LINE 547: all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and
LINE 548: bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their
LINE 549: queerities no telling how.
LINE 550: With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the
LINE 551: letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about
LINE 552: him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but
LINE 553: on Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit
LINE 554: near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman
LINE 555: that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of
LINE 556: women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he
LINE 557: was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the
LINE 558: coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men,
LINE 559: runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues
LINE 560: of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at
LINE 561: nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much
LINE 562: loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but
LINE 563: gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a
LINE 564: bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his
LINE 565: tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every
LINE 566: mother's son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that
LINE 567: is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he
LINE 568: says, Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to
LINE 569: be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a
LINE 570: wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish
LINE 571: in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take
LINE 572: of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the
LINE 573: meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his
LINE 574: embassy as he was sharpset. _Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the
LINE 575: French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a
LINE 576: winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a
LINE 577: child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough,
LINE 578: who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of
LINE 579: the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but
LINE 580: he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar
LINE 581: with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One
LINE 582: time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought
LINE 583: would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for
LINE 584: the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,
LINE 585: kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids'
LINE 586: linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times
LINE 587: as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to
LINE 588: his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw
LINE 589: him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to
LINE 590: know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but
LINE 591: this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce
LINE 592: believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood
LINE 593: beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been
LINE 594: some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
LINE 595: that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr
LINE 596: Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he.
LINE 597: More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little
LINE 598: moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had
LINE 599: dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the
LINE 600: hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted
LINE 601: cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the
LINE 602: bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He'll
LINE 603: find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's
LINE 604: Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and
LINE 605: he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I
LINE 606: conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our
LINE 607: island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with
LINE 608: an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the
LINE 609: table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a
LINE 610: portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a
LINE 611: coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his
LINE 612: nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
LINE 613: rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.
LINE 614: What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
LINE 615: that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
LINE 616: were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my
LINE 617: cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing,
LINE 618: and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and
LINE 619: the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he
LINE 620: taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess
LINE 621: and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the
LINE 622: month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the
LINE 623: nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
LINE 624: ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his
LINE 625: word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat
LINE 626: with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his
LINE 627: forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables
LINE 628: for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of
LINE 629: the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
LINE 630: heart's content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
LINE 631: called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To
LINE 632: remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in
LINE 633: their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on
LINE 634: his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow
LINE 635: out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. Ay, says another,
LINE 636: and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the
LINE 637: land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his
LINE 638: mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
LINE 639: island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the
LINE 640: grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got
LINE 641: scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a
LINE 642: husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or
LINE 643: a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting
LINE 644: up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry's orders.
LINE 645: There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the
LINE 646: lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an
LINE 647: old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I'll meddle in
LINE 648: his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with
LINE 649: the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says
LINE 650: Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to
LINE 651: dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the
LINE 652: first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
LINE 653: pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and
LINE 654: on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he
LINE 655: found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
LINE 656: champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
LINE 657: boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
LINE 658: head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
LINE 659: and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the
LINE 660: water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had
LINE 661: belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language
LINE 662: to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first
LINE 663: personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if
LINE 664: ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write
LINE 665: it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or
LINE 666: a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland
LINE 667: were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr
LINE 668: Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was
LINE 669: toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft,
LINE 670: loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all
LINE 671: masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread
LINE 672: three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed
LINE 673: anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times
LINE 674: three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea
LINE 675: to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr
LINE 676: Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:
LINE 677: _—Pope Peter's but a pissabed.
LINE 678: A man's a man for a' that._
LINE 679: Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
LINE 680: as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
LINE 681: whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
LINE 682: who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
LINE 683: cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil
LINE 684: enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
LINE 685: project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
LINE 686: on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
LINE 687: which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell's bearing a legend
LINE 688: printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and
LINE 689: Incubator. Lambay Island_. His project, as he went on to expound, was
LINE 690: to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief
LINE 691: business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and
LINE 692: to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has
LINE 693: been framed. Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I
LINE 694: make no doubt it smacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. 'Tis as
LINE 695: cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,
LINE 696: expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into
LINE 697: this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the
LINE 698: inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were
LINE 699: due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as
LINE 700: whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from
LINE 701: proclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the
LINE 702: nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so
LINE 703: many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest
LINE 704: bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial
LINE 705: cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
LINE 706: unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
LINE 707: sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty
LINE 708: fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart
LINE 709: weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a
LINE 710: suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of
LINE 711: worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in
LINE 712: fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord
LINE 713: Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our
LINE 714: ascendancy party. He proposed to set up there a national fertilising
LINE 715: farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the
LINE 716: fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
LINE 717: fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there
LINE 718: direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her
LINE 719: natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for
LINE 720: his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of
LINE 721: fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm
LINE 722: persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man. For his
LINE 723: nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet
LINE 724: of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
LINE 725: latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
LINE 726: broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
LINE 727: chillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
LINE 728: asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief
LINE 729: with which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken
LINE 730: by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as
LINE 731: might be observed by Mr Mulligan's smallclothes of a hodden grey which
LINE 732: was now somewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably
LINE 733: entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr
LINE 734: Dixon of Mary's excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
LINE 735: purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made
LINE 736: court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as
LINE 737: it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of
LINE 738: his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut
LINE 739: matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
LINE 740: titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
LINE 741: centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
LINE 742: wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
LINE 743: suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
LINE 744: farmyard drake and duck.
LINE 745: Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
LINE 746: man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
LINE 747: animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
LINE 748: while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
LINE 749: advanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
LINE 750: passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
LINE 751: nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for
LINE 752: whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
LINE 753: a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
LINE 754: assistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
LINE 755: heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he
LINE 756: was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne's house, that was
LINE 757: in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman's woe (and here he
LINE 758: fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr
LINE 759: Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
LINE 760: his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
LINE 761: ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
LINE 762: as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the
LINE 763: stomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,
LINE 764: smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
LINE 765: droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex
LINE 766: though 'tis pity she's a trollop): There's a belly that never bore a
LINE 767: bastard. This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth
LINE 768: and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.
LINE 769: The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some
LINE 770: larum in the antechamber.
LINE 771: Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
LINE 772: fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
LINE 773: with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
LINE 774: point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
LINE 775: obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
LINE 776: a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
LINE 777: not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
LINE 778: contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was
LINE 779: ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. _Mais bien
LINE 780: sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_. That
LINE 781: you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to
LINE 782: crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in
LINE 783: my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept
LINE 784: of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give
LINE 785: thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver
LINE 786: of good things. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,
LINE 787: took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening
LINE 788: his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
LINE 789: picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.
LINE 790: Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
LINE 791: said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
LINE 792: instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
LINE 793: feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
LINE 794: melting a tenderness, 'pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
LINE 795: impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands
LINE 796: of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never
LINE 797: so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
LINE 798: Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
LINE 799: favours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
LINE 800: replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.
LINE 801: Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
LINE 802: and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
LINE 803: thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished
LINE 804: coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of
LINE 805: maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled
LINE 806: and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in
LINE 807: anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
LINE 808: cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured
LINE 809: seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,
LINE 810: he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day
LINE 811: and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur
LINE 812: Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the
LINE 813: French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le
LINE 814: Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most
LINE 815: accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in
LINE 816: a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
LINE 817: Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even
LINE 818: the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans
LINE 819: blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest
LINE 820: posthaste to another world. Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch. The
LINE 821: clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than a
LINE 822: fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would
LINE 823: wear one. My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge
LINE 824: before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she
LINE 825: reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there
LINE 826: was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the
LINE 827: divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
LINE 828: household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our
LINE 829: original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is
LINE 830: the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she (and here my
LINE 831: pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my
LINE 832: attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),
LINE 833: the first is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall
LINE 834: cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of
LINE 835: our store of knowledge.
LINE 836: Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
LINE 837: all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
LINE 838: having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
LINE 839: a profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a
LINE 840: party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
LINE 841: not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
LINE 842: the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
LINE 843: ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.
LINE 844: A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I'll be sworn she has rendezvoused
LINE 845: you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad's bud, immensely so,
LINE 846: said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
LINE 847: hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O'Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
LINE 848: chin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been
LINE 849: wardmaid there any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried
LINE 850: the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and
LINE 851: with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the
LINE 852: man! Bless me, I'm all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you're as bad as dear
LINE 853: little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half
LINE 854: choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady
LINE 855: what's got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young
LINE 856: surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as
LINE 857: the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.
LINE 858: Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings
LINE 859: of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable
LINE 860: fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience,
LINE 861: said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to
LINE 862: instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence
LINE 863: due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth. I
LINE 864: am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
LINE 865: witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far
LINE 866: from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human
LINE 867: breast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable
LINE 868: Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of
LINE 869: ours? And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child
LINE 870: of clay? Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race
LINE 871: where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right
LINE 872: reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne. Having
LINE 873: delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
LINE 874: repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arose from all and some were
LINE 875: for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have
LINE 876: been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had
LINE 877: he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid
LINE 878: imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of
LINE 879: the true fold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was
LINE 880: always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
LINE 881: particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
LINE 882: to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks
LINE 883: back on with a loving heart.
LINE 884: To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
LINE 885: some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
LINE 886: of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.
LINE 887: The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as
LINE 888: overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were
LINE 889: difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
LINE 890: outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
LINE 891: they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
LINE 892: strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr
LINE 893: Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
LINE 894: that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born
LINE 895: out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into
LINE 896: the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent
LINE 897: indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
LINE 898: creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was
LINE 899: now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had
LINE 900: passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a
LINE 901: wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his
LINE 902: heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting
LINE 903: them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that
LINE 904: plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn
LINE 905: and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create
LINE 906: themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which
LINE 907: he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the
LINE 908: name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such
LINE 909: that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the
LINE 910: sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a
LINE 911: precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with
LINE 912: mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the
LINE 913: gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy
LINE 914: Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far
LINE 915: forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a
LINE 916: gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while
LINE 917: from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,
LINE 918: however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence
LINE 919: that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now
LINE 920: testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the
LINE 921: Supreme Being.
LINE 922: Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
LINE 923: his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to
LINE 924: express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid
LINE 925: genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
LINE 926: confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.
LINE 927: The dressy young blade said it was her husband's that put her in that
LINE 928: expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian
LINE 929: matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table
LINE 930: so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum
LINE 931: was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring
LINE 932: through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he
LINE 933: calls her. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event
LINE 934: would burst anon. 'Slife, I'll be round with you. I cannot but extol
LINE 935: the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
LINE 936: child out of her. All fell to praising of it, each after his own
LINE 937: fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that
LINE 938: another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in
LINE 939: orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed
LINE 940: in every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the
LINE 941: wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that
LINE 942: the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
LINE 943: seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic
LINE 944: titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of
LINE 945: levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
LINE 946: eminent have esteemed the noblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap
LINE 947: to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
LINE 948: more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.
LINE 949: But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
LINE 950: has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
LINE 951: to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
LINE 952: polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
LINE 953: counselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
LINE 954: advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
LINE 955: moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a
LINE 956: tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
LINE 957: cents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is
LINE 958: it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own
LINE 959: dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?
LINE 960: Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
LINE 961: the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
LINE 962: reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it
LINE 963: was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy
LINE 964: woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate
LINE 965: prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than
LINE 966: the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very
LINE 967: pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of
LINE 968: nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn
LINE 969: from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy's scouringbrush
LINE 970: not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with
LINE 971: Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish
LINE 972: asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe's hearing brought upon him from
LINE 973: an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as
LINE 974: straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach that
LINE 975: gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the
LINE 976: want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second
LINE 977: nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm
LINE 978: of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to
LINE 979: health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist
LINE 980: better with the doctrines that now engross him. His marital breast is
LINE 981: the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce. The
LINE 982: lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort
LINE 983: neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of
LINE 984: ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native
LINE 985: orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,
LINE 986: transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
LINE 987: quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,
LINE 988: acid and inoperative.
LINE 989: The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
LINE 990: usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
LINE 991: junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
LINE 992: delegation that an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself to
LINE 993: the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
LINE 994: afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
LINE 995: affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
LINE 996: exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
LINE 997: solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
LINE 998: palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
LINE 999: obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
LINE 1000: tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
LINE 1001: to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the
LINE 1002: display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union
LINE 1003: among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was
LINE 1004: successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,
LINE 1005: the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that
LINE 1006: rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as
LINE 1007: the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr
LINE 1008: Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,
LINE 1009: the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and
LINE 1010: triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the
LINE 1011: acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the
LINE 1012: agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)
LINE 1013: in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the
LINE 1014: medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other
LINE 1015: spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation
LINE 1016: of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the
LINE 1017: vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in
LINE 1018: the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
LINE 1019: artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb
LINE 1020: consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the
LINE 1021: species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
LINE 1022: distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers
LINE 1023: _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and
LINE 1024: monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of
LINE 1025: consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which
LINE 1026: Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic
LINE 1027: illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine
LINE 1028: were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the
LINE 1029: state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step
LINE 1030: over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
LINE 1031: strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a
LINE 1032: yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand
LINE 1033: against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the
LINE 1034: seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,
LINE 1035: supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain
LINE 1036: were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical
LINE 1037: explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens
LINE 1038: was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The
LINE 1039: hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and
LINE 1040: worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,
LINE 1041: envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some
LINE 1042: stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against
LINE 1043: both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the
LINE 1044: theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his
LINE 1045: authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of
LINE 1046: the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down
LINE 1047: to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his
LINE 1048: words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had
LINE 1049: been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of
LINE 1050: pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as
LINE 1051: the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously,
LINE 1052: a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr
LINE 1053: Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created
LINE 1054: in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty
LINE 1055: by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant
LINE 1056: submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the
LINE 1057: better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
LINE 1058: garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
LINE 1059: delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
LINE 1060: ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
LINE 1061: joined.
LINE 1062: But Malachias' tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up
LINE 1063: the scene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back
LINE 1064: and in the recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his
LINE 1065: flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,
LINE 1066: in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were
LINE 1067: depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I
LINE 1068: anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for
LINE 1069: which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the
LINE 1070: murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has no
LINE 1071: terrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what
LINE 1072: way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping
LINE 1073: Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the
LINE 1074: like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland's, is in this
LINE 1075: life. It is what I tried to obliterate my crime. Distractions,
LINE 1076: rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised
LINE 1077: the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! His spectre stalks me.
LINE 1078: Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry
LINE 1079: he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later his head
LINE 1080: appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station
LINE 1081: at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the
LINE 1082: dissipated host. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The
LINE 1083: vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_. The
LINE 1084: sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense
LINE 1085: debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.
LINE 1086: The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His real name
LINE 1087: was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.
LINE 1088: He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The lonely
LINE 1089: house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. The
LINE 1090: spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from
LINE 1091: his hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer's ground.
LINE 1092: What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the
LINE 1093: chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
LINE 1094: merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as
LINE 1095: her mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
LINE 1096: the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
LINE 1097: modest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is
LINE 1098: young Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror
LINE 1099: within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure
LINE 1100: of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from
LINE 1101: the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel
LINE 1102: on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a
LINE 1103: mother's thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in
LINE 1104: his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a
LINE 1105: fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,
LINE 1106: a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright
LINE 1107: trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of
LINE 1108: compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out
LINE 1109: upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but
LINE 1110: the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but,
LINE 1111: more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at
LINE 1112: duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob's
LINE 1113: pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you
LINE 1114: may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some
LINE 1115: paper from the Europe of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is
LINE 1116: breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a
LINE 1117: tiny speck within the mist. Now he is himself paternal and these about
LINE 1118: him might be his sons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own
LINE 1119: child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the
LINE 1120: bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poor waif, a child
LINE 1121: of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her
LINE 1122: luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two
LINE 1123: raincaped shadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly!
LINE 1124: He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,
LINE 1125: the bridenight. They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer
LINE 1126: with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the
LINE 1127: world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair reader. In a breath 'twas
LINE 1128: done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away
LINE 1129: through the murk. She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.
LINE 1130: She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No, Leopold. Name and
LINE 1131: memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of thy strength was
LINE 1132: taken from thee—and in vain. No son of thy loins is by thee. There is
LINE 1133: none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.
LINE 1134: The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
LINE 1135: infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over
LINE 1136: regions of cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey
LINE 1137: twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,
LINE 1138: shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her
LINE 1139: mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight
LINE 1140: phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim
LINE 1141: shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.
LINE 1142: They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home
LINE 1143: of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more.
LINE 1144: And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of
LINE 1145: rebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks
LINE 1146: behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are
LINE 1147: scorpions. Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and
LINE 1148: mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_. Ominous
LINE 1149: revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned
LINE 1150: and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the
LINE 1151: giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all
LINE 1152: their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.
LINE 1153: Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
LINE 1154: gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine
LINE 1155: portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven's
LINE 1156: own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo,
LINE 1157: wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger
LINE 1158: of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost
LINE 1159: one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she
LINE 1160: now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan
LINE 1161: hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you
LINE 1162: call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and
LINE 1163: loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on
LINE 1164: currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply
LINE 1165: swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a
LINE 1166: myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled
LINE 1167: sign upon the forehead of Taurus.
LINE 1168: Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
LINE 1169: school together in Conmee's time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
LINE 1170: Pisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the
LINE 1171: past and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them
LINE 1172: into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
LINE 1173: my call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
LINE 1174: bard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair
LINE 1175: with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those
LINE 1176: leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
LINE 1177: more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your
LINE 1178: genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to
LINE 1179: see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you
LINE 1180: Stephaneforos. I heartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent
LINE 1181: Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He
LINE 1182: could not leave his mother an orphan. The young man's face grew dark.
LINE 1183: All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and
LINE 1184: of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the
LINE 1185: noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on
LINE 1186: Sceptre for a whim of the rider's name: Lenehan as much more. He told
LINE 1187: them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran
LINE 1188: out freshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts
LINE 1189: were beating. Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her
LINE 1190: scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run
LINE 1191: home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,
LINE 1192: reached, outstripped her. All was lost now. Phyllis was silent: her
LINE 1193: eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I am undone. But her lover
LINE 1194: consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some
LINE 1195: oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. A whacking
LINE 1196: fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and three
LINE 1197: today. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous
LINE 1198: buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it
LINE 1199: as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said
LINE 1200: with a light sigh. She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this
LINE 1201: hand, shall we behold such another. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do
LINE 1202: you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could have seen my queen today,
LINE 1203: Vincent said. How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair
LINE 1204: beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the
LINE 1205: right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air
LINE 1206: drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. In
LINE 1207: the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of
LINE 1208: those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his
LINE 1209: booth near the bridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm
LINE 1210: with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I
LINE 1211: pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but
LINE 1212: today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril. She is more taking then.
LINE 1213: Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we
LINE 1214: reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who
LINE 1215: met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by the
LINE 1216: hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty
LINE 1217: letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature
LINE 1218: turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight
LINE 1219: disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very
LINE 1220: trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo
LINE 1221: in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going by he
LINE 1222: had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had poor
LINE 1223: luck with Bass's mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
LINE 1224: propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
LINE 1225: withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.
LINE 1226: Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far
LINE 1227: away. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
LINE 1228: born. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
LINE 1229: incorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos
LINE 1230: told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
LINE 1231: priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the
LINE 1232: moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of
LINE 1233: the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were
LINE 1234: therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
LINE 1235: constellation.
LINE 1236: However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
LINE 1237: being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
LINE 1238: was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
LINE 1239: not the case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above
LINE 1240: was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
LINE 1241: animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
LINE 1242: that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
LINE 1243: speedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts
LINE 1244: he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
LINE 1245: by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
LINE 1246: amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
LINE 1247: certainly calculated to attract anyone's remark on account of its
LINE 1248: scarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
LINE 1249: transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
LINE 1250: altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
LINE 1251: before's observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
LINE 1252: or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
LINE 1253: mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both
LINE 1254: their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other
LINE 1255: was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily
LINE 1256: determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the
LINE 1257: neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid
LINE 1258: sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out
LINE 1259: with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
LINE 1260: attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it
LINE 1261: about the place.
LINE 1262: The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
LINE 1263: course of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The
LINE 1264: debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
LINE 1265: the loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne's house had never
LINE 1266: beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old
LINE 1267: rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
LINE 1268: encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at
LINE 1269: the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
LINE 1270: from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to
LINE 1271: him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early
LINE 1272: depravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place
LINE 1273: assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in
LINE 1274: stolid repose the squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident
LINE 1275: indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the
LINE 1276: figure of Bannon in explorer's kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide
LINE 1277: brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred
LINE 1278: manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the
LINE 1279: board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of
LINE 1280: pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of
LINE 1281: Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated
LINE 1282: the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
LINE 1283: vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained
LINE 1284: by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and
LINE 1285: constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever
LINE 1286: efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired
LINE 1287: pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.
LINE 1288: It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
LINE 1289: transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) contentions
LINE 1290: would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter
LINE 1291: to accepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often
LINE 1292: repeated, deals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the
LINE 1293: man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked
LINE 1294: and explain them as best he can. There may be, it is true, some
LINE 1295: questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first
LINE 1296: problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future
LINE 1297: determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of
LINE 1298: Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert
LINE 1299: others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long
LINE 1300: neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is
LINE 1301: it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,
LINE 1302: Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture
LINE 1303: of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature's
LINE 1304: favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on
LINE 1305: the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus
LINE 1306: felix_, of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same
LINE 1307: inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting
LINE 1308: because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but
LINE 1309: we all die in different ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames
LINE 1310: the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract
LINE 1311: adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk
LINE 1312: in dust. These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles
LINE 1313: offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers
LINE 1314: of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic
LINE 1315: cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors
LINE 1316: and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and
LINE 1317: every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia, he prophesied,
LINE 1318: would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely
LINE 1319: good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive
LINE 1320: pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as
LINE 1321: Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all
LINE 1322: these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular
LINE 1323: condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr
LINE 1324: J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to
LINE 1325: abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy
LINE 1326: labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by
LINE 1327: far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in
LINE 1328: the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or
LINE 1329: in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we are
LINE 1330: thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of
LINE 1331: nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too
LINE 1332: rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder
LINE 1333: is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,
LINE 1334: all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
LINE 1335: often baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is that
LINE 1336: thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and
LINE 1337: mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal
LINE 1338: movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,
LINE 1339: everything, in fine, in nature's vast workshop from the extinction of
LINE 1340: some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
LINE 1341: beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
LINE 1342: unascertained. Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
LINE 1343: normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly
LINE 1344: looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other
LINE 1345: children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet's
LINE 1346: words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
LINE 1347: cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
LINE 1348: are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
LINE 1349: germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively
LINE 1350: shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend
LINE 1351: to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
LINE 1352: arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings
LINE 1353: (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
LINE 1354: run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival
LINE 1355: of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus' (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be
LINE 1356: called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate,
LINE 1357: deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with
LINE 1358: pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous
LINE 1359: females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not
LINE 1360: to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly
LINE 1361: find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals
LINE 1362: as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
LINE 1363: alluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately
LINE 1364: acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this
LINE 1365: morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening
LINE 1366: bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid
LINE 1367: from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated
LINE 1368: that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed
LINE 1369: victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
LINE 1370: dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L.
LINE 1371: Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons' hall of the
LINE 1372: National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as
LINE 1373: is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the
LINE 1374: able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having
LINE 1375: stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete's
LINE 1376: allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of
LINE 1377: all nature's processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out
LINE 1378: again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. At the risk
LINE 1379: of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the
LINE 1380: less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was
LINE 1381: delivered.
LINE 1382: Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
LINE 1383: happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
LINE 1384: and doctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
LINE 1385: woman had manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and
LINE 1386: now she was very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone
LINE 1387: before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching
LINE 1388: scene. Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the
LINE 1389: motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty
LINE 1390: sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,
LINE 1391: breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal
LINE 1392: Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
LINE 1393: blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,
LINE 1394: to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful
LINE 1395: embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle
LINE 1396: stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity
LINE 1397: has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,
LINE 1398: College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now,
LINE 1399: it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old
LINE 1400: shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! How beautiful now
LINE 1401: across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her
LINE 1402: imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice,
LINE 1403: Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances),
LINE 1404: Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our
LINE 1405: famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and
LINE 1406: Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever
LINE 1407: there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful will be
LINE 1408: christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr
LINE 1409: Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer's office, Dublin Castle. And so
LINE 1410: time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no
LINE 1411: sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the
LINE 1412: ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the
LINE 1413: curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light
LINE 1414: whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so
LINE 1415: with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His
LINE 1416: own good time. You too have fought the good fight and played loyally
LINE 1417: your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful
LINE 1418: servant!
LINE 1419: There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
LINE 1420: memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the
LINE 1421: heart but they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow
LINE 1422: dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade
LINE 1423: himself that they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance
LINE 1424: word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront
LINE 1425: him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while
LINE 1426: timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
LINE 1427: of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with
LINE 1428: wine. Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
LINE 1429: under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
LINE 1430: shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,
LINE 1431: reproachful.
LINE 1432: The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
LINE 1433: that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
LINE 1434: trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
LINE 1435: unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life. A scene
LINE 1436: disengages itself in the observer's memory, evoked, it would seem, by a
LINE 1437: word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
LINE 1438: there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space
LINE 1439: of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
LINE 1440: Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game
LINE 1441: but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward
LINE 1442: over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief
LINE 1443: alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at
LINE 1444: times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,
LINE 1445: Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of
LINE 1446: arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of
LINE 1447: them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin
LINE 1448: so daintily against the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in
LINE 1449: linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth
LINE 1450: when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the
LINE 1451: urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little
LINE 1452: just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment
LINE 1453: of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother
LINE 1454: watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint
LINE 1455: shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad
LINE 1456: look.
LINE 1457: Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that
LINE 1458: antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their
LINE 1459: faces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of
LINE 1460: custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant
LINE 1461: watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long
LINE 1462: ago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with
LINE 1463: preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,
LINE 1464: compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched
LINE 1465: field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in
LINE 1466: an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of
LINE 1467: the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was
LINE 1468: the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of
LINE 1469: the word.
LINE 1470: Burke's! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and
LINE 1471: bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,
LINE 1472: punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,
LINE 1473: ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and
LINE 1474: what not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse
LINE 1475: Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon
LINE 1476: coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a
LINE 1477: milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,
LINE 1478: tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's
LINE 1479: of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them
LINE 1480: sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with
LINE 1481: nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up
LINE 1482: there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward
LINE 1483: of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout
LINE 1484: pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers
LINE 1485: close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?
LINE 1486: The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence
LINE 1487: celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._
LINE 1488: God's air, the Allfather's air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.
LINE 1489: Breathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done
LINE 1490: a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest
LINE 1491: progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most
LINE 1492: farraginous chronicle. Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven
LINE 1493: preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of
LINE 1494: man's work. Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog
LINE 1495: and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their
LINE 1496: daddies, Theodore. Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher's
LINE 1497: bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse? Head up!
LINE 1498: For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat. See,
LINE 1499: thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan? A
LINE 1500: canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell
LINE 1501: thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not
LINE 1502: worth a cracked kreutzer. Copulation without population! No, say I!
LINE 1503: Herod's slaughter of the innocents were the truer name. Vegetables,
LINE 1504: forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw,
LINE 1505: bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps,
LINE 1506: quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney,
LINE 1507: Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet,
LINE 1508: varicose veins. A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all
LINE 1509: such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not.
LINE 1510: With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and
LINE 1511: never—do. Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to
LINE 1512: cover like the transpontine bison. How saith Zarathustra? _Deine Kuh
LINE 1513: Trübsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters_. See! it
LINE 1514: displodes for thee in abundance. Drink, man, an udderful! Mother's
LINE 1515: milk, Purefoy, the milk of human kin, milk too of those burgeoning
LINE 1516: stars overhead rutilant in thin rainvapour, punch milk, such as those
LINE 1517: rioters will quaff in their guzzling den, milk of madness, the
LINE 1518: honeymilk of Canaan's land. Thy cow's dug was tough, what? Ay, but her
LINE 1519: milk is hot and sweet and fattening. No dollop this but thick rich
LINE 1520: bonnyclaber. To her, old patriarch! Pap! _Per deam Partulam et
LINE 1521: Pertundam nunc est bibendum!_
LINE 1522: All off for a buster, armstrong, hollering down the street. Bonafides.
LINE 1523: Where you slep las nigh? Timothy of the battered naggin. Like ole
