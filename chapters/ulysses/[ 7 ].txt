LINE 1: IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS
LINE 2: Before Nelson's pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started
LINE 3: for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,
LINE 4: Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,
LINE 5: Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold's Cross. The hoarse Dublin United
LINE 6: Tramway Company's timekeeper bawled them off:
LINE 7: —Rathgar and Terenure!
LINE 8: —Come on, Sandymount Green!
LINE 9: Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a
LINE 10: singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided
LINE 11: parallel.
LINE 12: —Start, Palmerston Park!
LINE 13: THE WEARER OF THE CROWN
LINE 14: Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and
LINE 15: polished. Parked in North Prince's street His Majesty's vermilion
LINE 16: mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received
LINE 17: loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured
LINE 18: and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.
LINE 19: GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS
LINE 20: Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince's stores
LINE 21: and bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped
LINE 22: dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince's
LINE 23: stores.
LINE 24: —There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.
LINE 25: —Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I'll take it round to
LINE 26: the _Telegraph_ office.
LINE 27: The door of Ruttledge's office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in
LINE 28: a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out
LINE 29: with a roll of papers under his cape, a king's courier.
LINE 30: Red Murray's long shears sliced out the advertisement from the
LINE 31: newspaper in four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.
LINE 32: —I'll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut
LINE 33: square.
LINE 34: —Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind
LINE 35: his ear, we can do him one.
LINE 36: —Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I'll rub that in.
LINE 37: We.
LINE 38: WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT
LINE 39: Red Murray touched Mr Bloom's arm with the shears and whispered:
LINE 40: —Brayden.
LINE 41: Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a
LINE 42: stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman
LINE 43: and National Press_ and the _Freeman's Journal and National Press_.
LINE 44: Dullthudding Guinness's barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,
LINE 45: steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back
LINE 46: ascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,
LINE 47: Simon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck,
LINE 48: fat, neck, fat, neck.
LINE 49: —Don't you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.
LINE 50: The door of Ruttledge's office whispered: ee: cree. They always build
LINE 51: one door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.
LINE 52: Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.
LINE 53: Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.
LINE 54: —Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 55: —Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our
LINE 56: Saviour.
LINE 57: Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his
LINE 58: heart. In _Martha._
LINE 59: Co-ome thou lost one,
LINE 60: Co-ome thou dear one!
LINE 61: THE CROZIER AND THE PEN
LINE 62: —His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.
LINE 63: They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.
LINE 64: A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and
LINE 65: stepped off posthaste with a word:
LINE 66: _—Freeman!_
LINE 67: Mr Bloom said slowly:
LINE 68: —Well, he is one of our saviours also.
LINE 69: A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed
LINE 70: in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along
LINE 71: the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?
LINE 72: Thumping. Thumping.
LINE 73: He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn
LINE 74: packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards
LINE 75: Nannetti's reading closet.
LINE 76: WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST
LINE 77: RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS
LINE 78: Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This
LINE 79: morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a
LINE 80: man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His
LINE 81: machineries are pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand:
LINE 82: fermenting. Working away, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing
LINE 83: to get in.
LINE 84: HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT
LINE 85: Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman's spare body, admiring a glossy
LINE 86: crown.
LINE 87: Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for
LINE 88: College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was
LINE 89: worth. It's the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news
LINE 90: in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in
LINE 91: the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of
LINE 92: Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule
LINE 93: pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets
LINE 94: exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake's weekly Pat
LINE 95: and Bull story. Uncle Toby's page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin's
LINE 96: queries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I'd like
LINE 97: that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note. M. A. P.
LINE 98: Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World's biggest
LINE 99: balloon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms
LINE 100: laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than
LINE 101: the Irish.
LINE 102: The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he
LINE 103: got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they'd clank on
LINE 104: and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle
LINE 105: the whole thing. Want a cool head.
LINE 106: —Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.
LINE 107: Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.
LINE 108: The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the
LINE 109: sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently
LINE 110: over the dirty glass screen.
LINE 111: —Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.
LINE 112: Mr Bloom stood in his way.
LINE 113: —If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,
LINE 114: pointing backward with his thumb.
LINE 115: —Did you? Hynes asked.
LINE 116: —Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you'll catch him.
LINE 117: —Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I'll tap him too.
LINE 118: He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman's Journal_.
LINE 119: Three bob I lent him in Meagher's. Three weeks. Third hint.
LINE 120: WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK
LINE 121: Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti's desk.
LINE 122: —Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?
LINE 123: Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.
LINE 124: —He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 125: The foreman moved his pencil towards it.
LINE 126: —But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants
LINE 127: two keys at the top.
LINE 128: Hell of a racket they make. He doesn't hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.
LINE 129: Maybe he understands what I.
LINE 130: The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began
LINE 131: to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.
LINE 132: —Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.
LINE 133: Let him take that in first.
LINE 134: Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the
LINE 135: foreman's sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the
LINE 136: obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles
LINE 137: of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:
LINE 138: various uses, thousand and one things.
LINE 139: Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew
LINE 140: swiftly on the scarred woodwork.
LINE 141: HOUSE OF KEY(E)S
LINE 142: —Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.
LINE 143: Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.
LINE 144: Better not teach him his own business.
LINE 145: —You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top
LINE 146: in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that's a good idea?
LINE 147: The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched
LINE 148: there quietly.
LINE 149: —The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,
LINE 150: the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from
LINE 151: the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?
LINE 152: I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then
LINE 153: if he didn't know only make it awkward for him. Better not.
LINE 154: —We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?
LINE 155: —I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a
LINE 156: house there too. I'll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that
LINE 157: and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass
LINE 158: licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.
LINE 159: The foreman thought for an instant.
LINE 160: —We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months' renewal.
LINE 161: A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it
LINE 162: silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks,
LINE 163: watching the silent typesetters at their cases.
LINE 164: ORTHOGRAPHICAL
LINE 165: Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot
LINE 166: to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to
LINE 167: view the unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of
LINE 168: a harassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled
LINE 169: pear under a cemetery wall. Silly, isn't it? Cemetery put in of course
LINE 170: on account of the symmetry.
LINE 171: I should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to
LINE 172: have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have
LINE 173: said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.
LINE 174: Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its
LINE 175: flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost
LINE 176: human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.
LINE 177: That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in
LINE 178: its own way. Sllt.
LINE 179: NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR
LINE 180: The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:
LINE 181: —Wait. Where's the archbishop's letter? It's to be repeated in the
LINE 182: _Telegraph._ Where's what's his name?
LINE 183: He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.
LINE 184: —Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.
LINE 185: —Ay. Where's Monks?
LINE 186: —Monks!
LINE 187: Mr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.
LINE 188: —Then I'll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you'll give it a
LINE 189: good place I know.
LINE 190: —Monks!
LINE 191: —Yes, sir.
LINE 192: Three months' renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it
LINE 193: anyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge.
LINE 194: Tourists over for the show.
LINE 195: A DAYFATHER
LINE 196: He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed,
LINE 197: spectacled, aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he
LINE 198: must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs'
LINE 199: ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his
LINE 200: tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I'd say.
LINE 201: Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the
LINE 202: parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.
LINE 203: AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER
LINE 204: He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.
LINE 205: Reads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some
LINE 206: practice that. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading
LINE 207: backwards with his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear,
LINE 208: O dear! All that long business about that brought us out of the land of
LINE 209: Egypt and into the house of bondage _alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai
LINE 210: Elohenu_. No, that's the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob's sons.
LINE 211: And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water
LINE 212: and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he
LINE 213: kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you
LINE 214: come to look into it well. Justice it means but it's everybody eating
LINE 215: everyone else. That's what life is after all. How quickly he does that
LINE 216: job. Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.
LINE 217: Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to
LINE 218: the landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch
LINE 219: him out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as
LINE 220: Citron's house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.
LINE 221: ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP
LINE 222: He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those
LINE 223: walls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy
LINE 224: smell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom's next door
LINE 225: when I was there.
LINE 226: He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap
LINE 227: I put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief
LINE 228: he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket
LINE 229: of his trousers.
LINE 230: What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something
LINE 231: I forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.
LINE 232: A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.
LINE 233: Know who that is. What's up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it
LINE 234: is.
LINE 235: He entered softly.
LINE 236: ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA
LINE 237: —The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to
LINE 238: the dusty windowpane.
LINE 239: Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert's quizzing
LINE 240: face, asked of it sourly:
LINE 241: —Agonising Christ, wouldn't it give you a heartburn on your arse?
LINE 242: Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
LINE 243: —_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on
LINE 244: its way, tho' quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
LINE 245: waters of Neptune's blue domain, 'mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest
LINE 246: zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or 'neath the shadows cast
LINE 247: o'er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the
LINE 248: forest_. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his
LINE 249: newspaper. How's that for high?
LINE 250: —Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.
LINE 251: Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
LINE 252: —_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_. O boys! O boys!
LINE 253: —And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
LINE 254: the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.
LINE 255: —That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don't want to
LINE 256: hear any more of the stuff.
LINE 257: He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
LINE 258: hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
LINE 259: High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.
LINE 260: Rather upsets a man's day, a funeral does. He has influence they say.
LINE 261: Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his
LINE 262: greatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death
LINE 263: written this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first
LINE 264: himself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges
LINE 265: Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on
LINE 266: gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.
LINE 267: —Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.
LINE 268: —What is it? Mr Bloom asked.
LINE 269: —A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
LINE 270: with pomp of tone. _Our lovely land_.
LINE 271: SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
LINE 272: —Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.
LINE 273: —Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an
LINE 274: accent on the whose.
LINE 275: —Dan Dawson's land Mr Dedalus said.
LINE 276: —Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.
LINE 277: Ned Lambert nodded.
LINE 278: —But listen to this, he said.
LINE 279: The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
LINE 280: pushed in.
LINE 281: —Excuse me, J. J. O'Molloy said, entering.
LINE 282: Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.
LINE 283: —I beg yours, he said.
LINE 284: —Good day, Jack.
LINE 285: —Come in. Come in.
LINE 286: —Good day.
LINE 287: —How are you, Dedalus?
LINE 288: —Well. And yourself?
LINE 289: J. J. O'Molloy shook his head.
LINE 290: SAD
LINE 291: Cleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.
LINE 292: That hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What's
LINE 293: in the wind, I wonder. Money worry.
LINE 294: —_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._
LINE 295: —You're looking extra.
LINE 296: —Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O'Molloy asked, looking towards the
LINE 297: inner door.
LINE 298: —Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He's in
LINE 299: his sanctum with Lenehan.
LINE 300: J. J. O'Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
LINE 301: pink pages of the file.
LINE 302: Practice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of
LINE 303: honour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and
LINE 304: T. Fitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their
LINE 305: sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work
LINE 306: for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford
LINE 307: began on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer
LINE 308: about when they get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold
LINE 309: in the same breath. Wouldn't know which to believe. One story good till
LINE 310: you hear the next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then
LINE 311: all blows over. Hail fellow well met the next moment.
LINE 312: —Ah, listen to this for God' sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. _Or again if we
LINE 313: but climb the serried mountain peaks..._
LINE 314: —Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated
LINE 315: windbag!
LINE 316: —_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our
LINE 317: souls, as it were..._
LINE 318: —Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he
LINE 319: taking anything for it?
LINE 320: _—As 'twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland's portfolio,
LINE 321: unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize
LINE 322: regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and
LINE 323: luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent
LINE 324: translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._
LINE 325: HIS NATIVE DORIC
LINE 326: —The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.
LINE 327: _—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of
LINE 328: the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._
LINE 329: —O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and
LINE 330: onions! That'll do, Ned. Life is too short.
LINE 331: He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
LINE 332: moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.
LINE 333: Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An
LINE 334: instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh's
LINE 335: unshaven blackspectacled face.
LINE 336: —Doughy Daw! he cried.
LINE 337: WHAT WETHERUP SAID
LINE 338: All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
LINE 339: cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn't he? Why they
LINE 340: call him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged
LINE 341: to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that
LINE 342: nicely. Entertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said
LINE 343: that. Get a grip of them by the stomach.
LINE 344: The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
LINE 345: by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared
LINE 346: about them and the harsh voice asked:
LINE 347: —What is it?
LINE 348: —And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said
LINE 349: grandly.
LINE 350: —Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.
LINE 351: —Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink
LINE 352: after that.
LINE 353: —Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
LINE 354: —Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
LINE 355: Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor's blue eyes roved
LINE 356: towards Mr Bloom's face, shadowed by a smile.
LINE 357: —Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.
LINE 358: MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
LINE 359: —North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We
LINE 360: won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
LINE 361: —Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
LINE 362: his toecaps.
LINE 363: —In Ohio! the editor shouted.
LINE 364: —So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
LINE 365: Passing out he whispered to J. J. O'Molloy:
LINE 366: —Incipient jigs. Sad case.
LINE 367: —Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.
LINE 368: My Ohio!
LINE 369: —A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.
LINE 370: O, HARP EOLIAN!
LINE 371: He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
LINE 372: off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant
LINE 373: unwashed teeth.
LINE 374: —Bingbang, bangbang.
LINE 375: Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
LINE 376: —Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.
LINE 377: He went in.
LINE 378: —What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming
LINE 379: to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
LINE 380: —That'll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.
LINE 381: Hello, Jack. That's all right.
LINE 382: —Good day, Myles, J. J. O'Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
LINE 383: limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?
LINE 384: The telephone whirred inside.
LINE 385: —Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.
LINE 386: SPOT THE WINNER
LINE 387: Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_'s tissues.
LINE 388: —Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.
LINE 389: Madden up.
LINE 390: He tossed the tissues on to the table.
LINE 391: Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
LINE 392: flung open.
LINE 393: —Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
LINE 394: Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
LINE 395: by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
LINE 396: steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
LINE 397: blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.
LINE 398: —It wasn't me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
LINE 399: —Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There's a hurricane
LINE 400: blowing.
LINE 401: Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
LINE 402: stooped twice.
LINE 403: —Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat
LINE 404: Farrell shoved me, sir.
LINE 405: He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
LINE 406: —Him, sir.
LINE 407: —Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
LINE 408: He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
LINE 409: J. J. O'Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
LINE 410: —Continued on page six, column four.
LINE 411: —Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.
LINE 412: Is the boss...? Yes, _Telegraph_... To where? Aha! Which auction
LINE 413: rooms?... Aha! I see... Right. I'll catch him.
LINE 414: A COLLISION ENSUES
LINE 415: The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped
LINE 416: against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
LINE 417: —_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and
LINE 418: making a grimace.
LINE 419: —My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I'm in a
LINE 420: hurry.
LINE 421: —Knee, Lenehan said.
LINE 422: He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
LINE 423: —The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.
LINE 424: —Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
LINE 425: He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O'Molloy
LINE 426: slapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a
LINE 427: mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on
LINE 428: the doorsteps:
LINE 429: We are the boys of Wexford
LINE 430: Who fought with heart and hand.
LINE 431: EXIT BLOOM
LINE 432: —I'm just running round to Bachelor's walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
LINE 433: ad of Keyes's. Want to fix it up. They tell me he's round there in
LINE 434: Dillon's.
LINE 435: He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
LINE 436: leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
LINE 437: suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
LINE 438: —Begone! he said. The world is before you.
LINE 439: —Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
LINE 440: J. J. O'Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan's hand and read them,
LINE 441: blowing them apart gently, without comment.
LINE 442: —He'll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
LINE 443: blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps
LINE 444: after him.
LINE 445: —Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.
LINE 446: A STREET CORTÈGE
LINE 447: Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
LINE 448: Bloom's wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
LINE 449: tail of white bowknots.
LINE 450: —Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
LINE 451: and you'll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the
LINE 452: walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.
LINE 453: He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
LINE 454: feet past the fireplace to J. J. O'Molloy who placed the tissues in his
LINE 455: receiving hands.
LINE 456: —What's that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two
LINE 457: gone?
LINE 458: —Who? the professor said, turning. They're gone round to the Oval for a
LINE 459: drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
LINE 460: —Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where's my hat?
LINE 461: He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
LINE 462: jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the
LINE 463: air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
LINE 464: —He's pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
LINE 465: —Seems to be, J. J. O'Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
LINE 466: murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the
LINE 467: most matches?
LINE 468: THE CALUMET OF PEACE
LINE 469: He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
LINE 470: promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J.
LINE 471: J. O'Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
LINE 472: —_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.
LINE 473: The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
LINE 474: declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
LINE 475: 'Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
LINE 476: 'Twas empire charmed thy heart.
LINE 477: The professor grinned, locking his long lips.
LINE 478: —Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
LINE 479: He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him
LINE 480: with quick grace, said:
LINE 481: —Silence for my brandnew riddle!
LINE 482: —_Imperium romanum_, J. J. O'Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than
LINE 483: British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.
LINE 484: Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
LINE 485: —That's it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.
LINE 486: We haven't got the chance of a snowball in hell.
LINE 487: THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
LINE 488: —Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We
LINE 489: mustn't be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,
LINE 490: imperial, imperious, imperative.
LINE 491: He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
LINE 492: —What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.
LINE 493: The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to
LINE 494: be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah_. The Roman, like the
LINE 495: Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
LINE 496: which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
LINE 497: obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to
LINE 498: be here. Let us construct a watercloset._
LINE 499: —Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient
LINE 500: ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness's, were partial
LINE 501: to the running stream.
LINE 502: —They were nature's gentlemen, J. J. O'Molloy murmured. But we have
LINE 503: also Roman law.
LINE 504: —And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
LINE 505: —Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O'Molloy asked.
LINE 506: It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly
LINE 507: ...
LINE 508: —First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
LINE 509: Mr O'Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
LINE 510: the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.
LINE 511: —_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.
LINE 512: —I escort a suppliant, Mr O'Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by
LINE 513: Experience visits Notoriety.
LINE 514: —How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your
LINE 515: governor is just gone.
LINE 516: ???
LINE 517: Lenehan said to all:
LINE 518: —Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,
LINE 519: excogitate, reply.
LINE 520: Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
LINE 521: signature.
LINE 522: —Who? the editor asked.
LINE 523: Bit torn off.
LINE 524: —Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.
LINE 525: —That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?
LINE 526: On swift sail flaming
LINE 527: From storm and south
LINE 528: He comes, pale vampire,
LINE 529: Mouth to my mouth.
LINE 530: —Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
LINE 531: shoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?
LINE 532: Bullockbefriending bard.
LINE 533: SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
LINE 534: —Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr
LINE 535: Garrett Deasy asked me to...
LINE 536: —O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The
LINE 537: bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and
LINE 538: mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the
LINE 539: waiter's face in the Star and Garter. Oho!
LINE 540: A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of
LINE 541: Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O'Rourke, prince of Breffni.
LINE 542: —Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
LINE 543: —Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
LINE 544: typescript. Emperor's horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on
LINE 545: the ramparts of Vienna. Don't you forget! Maximilian Karl O'Donnell,
LINE 546: graf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an
LINE 547: Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild
LINE 548: geese. O yes, every time. Don't you forget that!
LINE 549: —The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O'Molloy said quietly,
LINE 550: turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.
LINE 551: Professor MacHugh turned on him.
LINE 552: —And if not? he said.
LINE 553: —I'll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one
LINE 554: day...
LINE 555: LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
LINE 556: —We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for
LINE 557: us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never
LINE 558: loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
LINE 559: language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
LINE 560: the maxim: time is money. Material domination. _Dominus!_ Lord! Where
LINE 561: is the spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend
LINE 562: club. But the Greek!
LINE 563: KYRIE ELEISON!
LINE 564: A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
LINE 565: lips.
LINE 566: —The Greek! he said again. _Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the
LINE 567: Semite and the Saxon know not. _Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.
LINE 568: I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. _Kyrie eleison!_
LINE 569: The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.
LINE 570: We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered
LINE 571: at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that
LINE 572: went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went
LINE 573: under. Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve
LINE 574: the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to a lost cause.
LINE 575: He strode away from them towards the window.
LINE 576: —They went forth to battle, Mr O'Madden Burke said greyly, but they
LINE 577: always fell.
LINE 578: —Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in
LINE 579: the latter half of the _matinée_. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
LINE 580: He whispered then near Stephen's ear:
LINE 581: LENEHAN'S LIMERICK
LINE 582: —_There's a ponderous pundit MacHugh
LINE 583: Who wears goggles of ebony hue.
LINE 584: As he mostly sees double
LINE 585: To wear them why trouble?
LINE 586: I can't see the Joe Miller. Can you?_
LINE 587: In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.
LINE 588: Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.
LINE 589: —That'll be all right, he said. I'll read the rest after. That'll be
LINE 590: all right.
LINE 591: Lenehan extended his hands in protest.
LINE 592: —But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?
LINE 593: —Opera? Mr O'Madden Burke's sphinx face reriddled.
LINE 594: Lenehan announced gladly:
LINE 595: —_The Rose of Castile_. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!
LINE 596: He poked Mr O'Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O'Madden Burke fell
LINE 597: back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.
LINE 598: —Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.
LINE 599: Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
LINE 600: tissues.
LINE 601: The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
LINE 602: Stephen's and Mr O'Madden Burke's loose ties.
LINE 603: —Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.
LINE 604: —Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O'Molloy said in
LINE 605: quiet mockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland
LINE 606: between you? You look as though you had done the deed. General
LINE 607: Bobrikoff.
LINE 608: OMNIUM GATHERUM
LINE 609: —We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.
LINE 610: —All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...
LINE 611: —The turf, Lenehan put in.
LINE 612: —Literature, the press.
LINE 613: —If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of
LINE 614: advertisement.
LINE 615: —And Madam Bloom, Mr O'Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin's
LINE 616: prime favourite.
LINE 617: Lenehan gave a loud cough.
LINE 618: —Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
LINE 619: cold in the park. The gate was open.
LINE 620: "YOU CAN DO IT!"
LINE 621: The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen's shoulder.
LINE 622: —I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite
LINE 623: in it. You can do it. I see it in your face. _In the lexicon of
LINE 624: youth_...
LINE 625: See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.
LINE 626: —Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great
LINE 627: nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the
LINE 628: public! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn
LINE 629: its soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M'Carthy.
LINE 630: —We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
LINE 631: Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.
LINE 632: —He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O'Molloy said.
LINE 633: THE GREAT GALLAHER
LINE 634: —You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in
LINE 635: emphasis. Wait a minute. We'll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher
LINE 636: used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the
LINE 637: Clarence. Gallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You
LINE 638: know how he made his mark? I'll tell you. That was the smartest piece
LINE 639: of journalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
LINE 640: the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
LINE 641: suppose. I'll show you.
LINE 642: He pushed past them to the files.
LINE 643: —Look at here, he said turning. The _New York World_ cabled for a
LINE 644: special. Remember that time?
LINE 645: Professor MacHugh nodded.
LINE 646: —_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw
LINE 647: hat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and
LINE 648: the rest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?
LINE 649: —Skin-the-Goat, Mr O'Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that
LINE 650: cabman's shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me.
LINE 651: You know Holohan?
LINE 652: —Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.
LINE 653: —And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
LINE 654: the corporation. A night watchman.
LINE 655: Stephen turned in surprise.
LINE 656: —Gumley? he said. You don't say so? A friend of my father's, is it?
LINE 657: —Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind the
LINE 658: stones, see they don't run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius
LINE 659: Gallaher do? I'll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.
LINE 660: Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?
LINE 661: He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.
LINE 662: —Take page four, advertisement for Bransome's coffee, let us say. Have
LINE 663: you got that? Right.
LINE 664: The telephone whirred.
LINE 665: A DISTANT VOICE
LINE 666: —I'll answer it, the professor said, going.
LINE 667: —B is parkgate. Good.
LINE 668: His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.
LINE 669: —T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon
LINE 670: gate.
LINE 671: The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock's wattles. An illstarched
LINE 672: dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
LINE 673: waistcoat.
LINE 674: —Hello? _Evening Telegraph_ here... Hello?... Who's there?... Yes...
LINE 675: Yes... Yes.
LINE 676: —F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
LINE 677: Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.
LINE 678: Got that? X is Davy's publichouse in upper Leeson street.
LINE 679: The professor came to the inner door.
LINE 680: —Bloom is at the telephone, he said.
LINE 681: —Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy's
LINE 682: publichouse, see?
LINE 683: CLEVER, VERY
LINE 684: —Clever, Lenehan said. Very.
LINE 685: —Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
LINE 686: history.
LINE 687: Nightmare from which you will never awake.
LINE 688: —I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the
LINE 689: besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
LINE 690: myself.
LINE 691: Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
LINE 692: —Madam, I'm Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.
LINE 693: —History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince's street was
LINE 694: there first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of
LINE 695: an advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the
LINE 696: leg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._
LINE 697: Now he's got in with Blumenfeld. That's press. That's talent. Pyatt! He
LINE 698: was all their daddies!
LINE 699: —The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
LINE 700: brother-in-law of Chris Callinan.
LINE 701: —Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he's here still. Come across
LINE 702: yourself.
LINE 703: —Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.
LINE 704: He flung the pages down.
LINE 705: —Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O'Madden Burke.
LINE 706: —Very smart, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
LINE 707: Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.
LINE 708: —Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
LINE 709: were up before the recorder...
LINE 710: —O yes, J. J. O'Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home
LINE 711: through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
LINE 712: cyclone last year and thought she'd buy a view of Dublin. And it turned
LINE 713: out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
LINE 714: Skin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
LINE 715: —They're only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.
LINE 716: Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
LINE 717: fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O'Hagan.
LINE 718: Eh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.
LINE 719: His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.
LINE 720: Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you
LINE 721: write it then?
LINE 722: RHYMES AND REASONS
LINE 723: Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be
LINE 724: some. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the
LINE 725: same, looking the same, two by two.
LINE 726: ........................ la tua pace
LINE 727: .................. che parlar ti piace
LINE 728: Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace.
LINE 729: He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in
LINE 730: russet, entwining, _per l'aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella
LINE 731: pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più ardenti._
LINE 732: But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth
LINE 733: south: tomb womb.
LINE 734: —Speak up for yourself, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
LINE 735: SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...
LINE 736: J. J. O'Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.
LINE 737: —My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
LINE 738: construction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
LINE 739: the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running
LINE 740: away with you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes
LINE 741: and Edmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod
LINE 742: boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the
LINE 743: Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly's Budget_, _Pue's
LINE 744: Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_. Why bring
LINE 745: in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the
LINE 746: day is the newspaper thereof.
LINE 747: LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
LINE 748: —Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his
LINE 749: face. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.
LINE 750: Who have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!
LINE 751: —Well, J. J. O'Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.
LINE 752: —Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it
LINE 753: in his blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.
LINE 754: —He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
LINE 755: .... But no matter.
LINE 756: J. J. O'Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
LINE 757: —One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
LINE 758: fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,
LINE 759: the Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.
LINE 760: _And in the porches of mine ear did pour._
LINE 761: By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other
LINE 762: story, beast with two backs?
LINE 763: —What was that? the professor asked.
LINE 764: ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
LINE 765: —He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O'Molloy said, of Roman justice
LINE 766: as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_. And he
LINE 767: cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.
LINE 768: —Ha.
LINE 769: —A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!
LINE 770: Pause. J. J. O'Molloy took out his cigarettecase.
LINE 771: False lull. Something quite ordinary.
LINE 772: Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
LINE 773: I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
LINE 774: it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,
LINE 775: that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.
LINE 776: A POLISHED PERIOD
LINE 777: J. J. O'Molloy resumed, moulding his words:
LINE 778: —He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and
LINE 779: terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and
LINE 780: of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of
LINE 781: sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of
LINE 782: soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._
LINE 783: His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.
LINE 784: —Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.
LINE 785: —The divine afflatus, Mr O'Madden Burke said.
LINE 786: —You like it? J. J. O'Molloy asked Stephen.
LINE 787: Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He
LINE 788: took a cigarette from the case. J. J. O'Molloy offered his case to
LINE 789: Myles Crawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his
LINE 790: trophy, saying:
LINE 791: —Muchibus thankibus.
LINE 792: A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
LINE 793: —Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O'Molloy said
LINE 794: to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal
LINE 795: hush poets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it.
LINE 796: She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee
LINE 797: interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to
LINE 798: ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have
LINE 799: been pulling A. E.'s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale,
LINE 800: Magennis.
LINE 801: Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say
LINE 802: about me? Don't ask.
LINE 803: —No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
LINE 804: Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I
LINE 805: ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
LINE 806: society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
LINE 807: spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
LINE 808: advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
LINE 809: He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
LINE 810: —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his
LINE 811: discourse.
LINE 812: —He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O'Molloy said, rumour has it, on
LINE 813: the Trinity college estates commission.
LINE 814: —He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child's
LINE 815: frock. Go on. Well?
LINE 816: —It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
LINE 817: full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
LINE 818: not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man's contumely
LINE 819: upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,
LINE 820: therefore worthless.
LINE 821: He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
LINE 822: outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
LINE 823: ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
LINE 824: focus.
LINE 825: IMPROMPTU
LINE 826: In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O'Molloy:
LINE 827: —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had
LINE 828: prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
LINE 829: shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
LINE 830: beard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
LINE 831: looked (though he was not) a dying man.
LINE 832: His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O'Molloy's towards
LINE 833: Stephen's face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His
LINE 834: unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
LINE 835: withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
LINE 836: —When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.
LINE 837: Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.
LINE 838: He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.
LINE 839: Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.
LINE 840: He began:
LINE 841: _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
LINE 842: listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
LINE 843: since by my learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported
LINE 844: into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this
LINE 845: age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
LINE 846: speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful
LINE 847: Moses._
LINE 848: His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
LINE 849: ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. _And let our
LINE 850: crooked smokes._ Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand
LINE 851: at it yourself?
LINE 852: _—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
LINE 853: highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard
LINE 854: his words and their meaning was revealed to me._
LINE 855: FROM THE FATHERS
LINE 856: It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are
LINE 857: corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they
LINE 858: were good could be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That's saint Augustine.
LINE 859: _—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
LINE 860: language? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.
LINE 861: You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
LINE 862: our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
LINE 863: furrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from
LINE 864: primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
LINE 865: history and a polity._
LINE 866: Nile.
LINE 867: Child, man, effigy.
LINE 868: By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
LINE 869: in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.
LINE 870: _—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
LINE 871: mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.
LINE 872: Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is
LINE 873: weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
LINE 874: arms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
LINE 875: our name._
LINE 876: A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it
LINE 877: boldly:
LINE 878: _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
LINE 879: accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
LINE 880: and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never
LINE 881: have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor
LINE 882: followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken
LINE 883: with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai's mountaintop nor ever have
LINE 884: come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and
LINE 885: bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of
LINE 886: the outlaw._
LINE 887: He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.
LINE 888: OMINOUS—FOR HIM!
LINE 889: J. J. O'Molloy said not without regret:
LINE 890: —And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.
LINE 891: —A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously—
LINE 892: expectorated—demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future behind him.
LINE 893: The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and
LINE 894: pattering up the staircase.
LINE 895: —That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.
LINE 896: Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles
LINE 897: of ears of porches. The tribune's words, howled and scattered to the
LINE 898: four winds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic
LINE 899: records of all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me
LINE 900: no more.
LINE 901: I have money.
LINE 902: —Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
LINE 903: suggest that the house do now adjourn?
LINE 904: —You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? Mr
LINE 905: O'Madden Burke asked. 'Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
LINE 906: metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.
LINE 907: —That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour
LINE 908: say ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To
LINE 909: which particular boosing shed...? My casting vote is: Mooney's!
LINE 910: He led the way, admonishing:
LINE 911: —We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,
LINE 912: we will not. By no manner of means.
LINE 913: Mr O'Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally's lunge of his
LINE 914: umbrella:
LINE 915: —Lay on, Macduff!
LINE 916: —Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
LINE 917: shoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?
LINE 918: He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.
LINE 919: —Foot and mouth. I know. That'll be all right. That'll go in. Where are
LINE 920: they? That's all right.
LINE 921: He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.
LINE 922: LET US HOPE
LINE 923: J. J. O'Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:
LINE 924: —I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.
LINE 925: He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.
LINE 926: —Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn't it? It
LINE 927: has the prophetic vision. _Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.
LINE 928: Kingdoms of this world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen
LINE 929: today.
LINE 930: The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
LINE 931: rushed out into the street, yelling:
LINE 932: —Racing special!
LINE 933: Dublin. I have much, much to learn.
LINE 934: They turned to the left along Abbey street.
LINE 935: —I have a vision too, Stephen said.
LINE 936: —Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will
LINE 937: follow.
LINE 938: Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
LINE 939: —Racing special!
LINE 940: DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
LINE 941: Dubliners.
LINE 942: —Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
LINE 943: and fiftythree years in Fumbally's lane.
LINE 944: —Where is that? the professor asked.
LINE 945: —Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.
LINE 946: Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering
LINE 947: tallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records.
LINE 948: Quicker, darlint!
LINE 949: On now. Dare it. Let there be life.
LINE 950: —They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson's pillar.
LINE 951: They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They
LINE 952: shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
LINE 953: with the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in
LINE 954: coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
LINE 955: umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.
LINE 956: —Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.
LINE 957: LIFE ON THE RAW
LINE 958: —They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
LINE 959: the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
LINE 960: Collins, proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from
LINE 961: a girl at the foot of Nelson's pillar to take off the thirst of the
LINE 962: brawn. They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile
LINE 963: and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
LINE 964: encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the
LINE 965: other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,
LINE 966: threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God.
LINE 967: They had no idea it was that high.
LINE 968: Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the
LINE 969: lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who
LINE 970: got a bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a
LINE 971: crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.
LINE 972: —Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can
LINE 973: see them. What's keeping our friend?
LINE 974: He turned.
LINE 975: A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
LINE 976: directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them
LINE 977: Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
LINE 978: face, talking with J. J. O'Molloy.
LINE 979: —Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.
LINE 980: He set off again to walk by Stephen's side.
LINE 981: RETURN OF BLOOM
LINE 982: —Yes, he said. I see them.
LINE 983: Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
LINE 984: offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called:
LINE 985: —Mr Crawford! A moment!
LINE 986: —_Telegraph_! Racing special!
LINE 987: —What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.
LINE 988: A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face:
LINE 989: —Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!
LINE 990: INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR
LINE 991: —Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
LINE 992: puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes
LINE 993: just now. He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he'll
LINE 994: see. But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the
LINE 995: Saturday pink. And he wants it copied if it's not too late I told
LINE 996: councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_. I can have access to it
LINE 997: in the national library. House of keys, don't you see? His name is
LINE 998: Keyes. It's a play on the name. But he practically promised he'd give
LINE 999: the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr
LINE 1000: Crawford?
LINE 1001: K.M.A.
LINE 1002: —Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing
LINE 1003: out his arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.
LINE 1004: A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.
LINE 1005: Lenehan's yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is
LINE 1006: that young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him
LINE 1007: today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in
LINE 1008: muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?
LINE 1009: —Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I
LINE 1010: suppose it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think. I'll tell
LINE 1011: him...
LINE 1012: K.M.R.I.A.
LINE 1013: —He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his
LINE 1014: shoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.
LINE 1015: While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on
LINE 1016: jerkily.
LINE 1017: RAISING THE WIND
LINE 1018: —_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I'm up to
LINE 1019: here. I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to
LINE 1020: back a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take
LINE 1021: the will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the
LINE 1022: wind anyhow.
LINE 1023: J. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught
LINE 1024: up on the others and walked abreast.
LINE 1025: —When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
LINE 1026: fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
LINE 1027: railings.
LINE 1028: —Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old
LINE 1029: Dublin women on the top of Nelson's pillar.
LINE 1030: SOME COLUMN!—THAT'S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
LINE 1031: —That's new, Myles Crawford said. That's copy. Out for the waxies'
LINE 1032: Dargle. Two old trickies, what?
LINE 1033: —But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see
LINE 1034: the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines'
LINE 1035: blue dome, Adam and Eve's, saint Laurence O'Toole's. But it makes them
LINE 1036: giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...
LINE 1037: THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
LINE 1038: —Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We're in the
LINE 1039: archdiocese here.
LINE 1040: —And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
LINE 1041: of the onehandled adulterer.
LINE 1042: —Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the
LINE 1043: idea. I see what you mean.
LINE 1044: DAMES DONATE DUBLIN'S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
LINE 1045: —It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
LINE 1046: tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between
LINE 1047: them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
LINE 1048: their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
LINE 1049: spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.
LINE 1050: He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O'Madden
LINE 1051: Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney's.
LINE 1052: —Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.
LINE 1053: SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH
LINE 1054: MOLARS. ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.
LINE 1055: —You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of
LINE 1056: Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were
LINE 1057: bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble
LINE 1058: and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of
LINE 1059: beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.
LINE 1060: Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.
LINE 1061: They made ready to cross O'Connell street.
LINE 1062: HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!
LINE 1063: At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless
LINE 1064: trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,
LINE 1065: Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green,
LINE 1066: Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper
LINE 1067: Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs,
LINE 1068: delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water
LINE 1069: floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn,
LINE 1070: rapidly.
LINE 1071: WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?
LINE 1072: —But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the
LINE 1073: plums?
LINE 1074: VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.
LINE 1075: —Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to
LINE 1076: reflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia fecit._
LINE 1077: —No, Stephen said. I call it _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The
LINE 1078: Parable of The Plums._
LINE 1079: —I see, the professor said.
LINE 1080: He laughed richly.
LINE 1081: —I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land.
LINE 1082: We gave him that idea, he added to J. J. O'Molloy.
LINE 1083: HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY
LINE 1084: J. J. O'Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held
LINE 1085: his peace.
LINE 1086: —I see, the professor said.
LINE 1087: He halted on sir John Gray's pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson
LINE 1088: through the meshes of his wry smile.
LINE 1089: DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE
LINE 1090: WIMBLES, FLO WANGLES—YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?
LINE 1091: —Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must
LINE 1092: say.
LINE 1093: —Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty's
LINE 1094: truth was known.
