LINE 1: I was just passing the time of day with old Troy of the D. M. P. at the
LINE 2: corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along
LINE 3: and he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have
LINE 4: the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony
LINE 5: Batter only Joe Hynes.
LINE 6: —Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody
LINE 7: chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?
LINE 8: —Soot's luck, says Joe. Who's the old ballocks you were talking to?
LINE 9: —Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I'm on two minds not to give that
LINE 10: fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and
LINE 11: ladders.
LINE 12: —What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.
LINE 13: —Devil a much, says I. There's a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the
LINE 14: garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving
LINE 15: me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God's quantity of tea and sugar to
LINE 16: pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a
LINE 17: hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury
LINE 18: street.
LINE 19: —Circumcised? says Joe.
LINE 20: —Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I'm
LINE 21: hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can't get a
LINE 22: penny out of him.
LINE 23: —That the lay you're on now? says Joe.
LINE 24: —Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful
LINE 25: debts. But that's the most notorious bloody robber you'd meet in a
LINE 26: day's walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of
LINE 27: rain. _Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him
LINE 28: to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I'll have him
LINE 29: summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a
LINE 30: licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he's fit to burst. Jesus,
LINE 31: I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. _He drink me
LINE 32: my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?_
LINE 33: For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin's
LINE 34: parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter
LINE 35: called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty,
LINE 36: esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,
LINE 37: gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds
LINE 38: avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per
LINE 39: pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed
LINE 40: crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor
LINE 41: to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling
LINE 42: for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said
LINE 43: vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three
LINE 44: shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall
LINE 45: not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said
LINE 46: purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and
LINE 47: exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good
LINE 48: will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by
LINE 49: the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as
LINE 50: this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors,
LINE 51: trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs,
LINE 52: successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.
LINE 53: —Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.
LINE 54: —Not taking anything between drinks, says I.
LINE 55: —What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.
LINE 56: —Who? says I. Sure, he's out in John of God's off his head, poor man.
LINE 57: —Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
LINE 58: —Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.
LINE 59: —Come around to Barney Kiernan's, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
LINE 60: —Barney mavourneen's be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
LINE 61: —Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
LINE 62: —What was that, Joe? says I.
LINE 63: —Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to
LINE 64: give the citizen the hard word about it.
LINE 65: So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
LINE 66: courthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he
LINE 67: has it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn't get over
LINE 68: that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a
LINE 69: licence, says he.
LINE 70: In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There
LINE 71: rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as
LINE 72: in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant
LINE 73: land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport
LINE 74: the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,
LINE 75: the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed
LINE 76: coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too
LINE 77: numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the
LINE 78: east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass
LINE 79: foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
LINE 80: planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal
LINE 81: world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely
LINE 82: maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing
LINE 83: the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects
LINE 84: as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts
LINE 85: of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful
LINE 86: insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to
LINE 87: Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht
LINE 88: the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan's land and of
LINE 89: Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the
LINE 90: sons of kings.
LINE 91: And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
LINE 92: by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
LINE 93: that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
LINE 94: of that land for O'Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
LINE 95: descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring
LINE 96: foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,
LINE 97: pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,
LINE 98: drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,
LINE 99: York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets
LINE 100: of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and
LINE 101: red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples
LINE 102: and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and
LINE 103: pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their
LINE 104: canes.
LINE 105: I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you
LINE 106: notorious bloody hill and dale robber!
LINE 107: And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
LINE 108: ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
LINE 109: and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and
LINE 110: Cuffe's prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
LINE 111: various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
LINE 112: heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
LINE 113: premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
LINE 114: cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
LINE 115: champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
LINE 116: pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
LINE 117: vales of Thomond, from the M'Gillicuddy's reeks the inaccessible and
LINE 118: lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
LINE 119: place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance
LINE 120: of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer's firkins
LINE 121: and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great
LINE 122: hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.
LINE 123: So we turned into Barney Kiernan's and there, sure enough, was the
LINE 124: citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
LINE 125: bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
LINE 126: drop in the way of drink.
LINE 127: —There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
LINE 128: load of papers, working for the cause.
LINE 129: The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.
LINE 130: Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that
LINE 131: bloody dog. I'm told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off
LINE 132: a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
LINE 133: about a licence.
LINE 134: —Stand and deliver, says he.
LINE 135: —That's all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
LINE 136: —Pass, friends, says he.
LINE 137: Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
LINE 138: —What's your opinion of the times?
LINE 139: Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to
LINE 140: the occasion.
LINE 141: —I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
LINE 142: fork.
LINE 143: So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
LINE 144: —Foreign wars is the cause of it.
LINE 145: And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
LINE 146: —It's the Russians wish to tyrannise.
LINE 147: —Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I've a thirst on me
LINE 148: I wouldn't sell for half a crown.
LINE 149: —Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.
LINE 150: —Wine of the country, says he.
LINE 151: —What's yours? says Joe.
LINE 152: —Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
LINE 153: —Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how's the old heart, citizen? says
LINE 154: he.
LINE 155: —Never better, _a chara_, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
LINE 156: And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
LINE 157: and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
LINE 158: The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
LINE 159: that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
LINE 160: freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
LINE 161: deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
LINE 162: hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
LINE 163: rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
LINE 164: his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
LINE 165: in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).
LINE 166: The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
LINE 167: projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
LINE 168: obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in
LINE 169: which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
LINE 170: dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm
LINE 171: breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his
LINE 172: mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations
LINE 173: of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the
LINE 174: summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to
LINE 175: vibrate and tremble.
LINE 176: He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to
LINE 177: the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a
LINE 178: girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of
LINE 179: deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were
LINE 180: encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet
LINE 181: being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
LINE 182: the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled
LINE 183: at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with
LINE 184: rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and
LINE 185: heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine
LINE 186: hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane
LINE 187: O'Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh
LINE 188: O'Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O'Growney, Michael
LINE 189: Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M'Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley,
LINE 190: Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain
LINE 191: Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.
LINE 192: Fursa, S. Brendan, Marshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone,
LINE 193: the Mother of the Maccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of
LINE 194: Castile, the Man for Galway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte
LINE 195: Carlo, The Man in the Gap, The Woman Who Didn't, Benjamin Franklin,
LINE 196: Napoleon Bonaparte, John L. Sullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish,
LINE 197: Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir Thomas Lipton, William Tell,
LINE 198: Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of Lammermoor, Peter the
LINE 199: Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick W. Shakespeare, Brian
LINE 200: Confucius, Murtagh Gutenberg, Patricio Velasquez, Captain Nemo, Tristan
LINE 201: and Isolde, the first Prince of Wales, Thomas Cook and Son, the Bold
LINE 202: Soldier Boy, Arrah na Pogue, Dick Turpin, Ludwig Beethoven, the Colleen
LINE 203: Bawn, Waddler Healy, Angus the Culdee, Dolly Mount, Sidney Parade, Ben
LINE 204: Howth, Valentine Greatrakes, Adam and Eve, Arthur Wellesley, Boss
LINE 205: Croker, Herodotus, Jack the Giantkiller, Gautama Buddha, Lady Godiva,
LINE 206: The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the Queen of Sheba, Acky
LINE 207: Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa, Don
LINE 208: Philip O'Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of acuminated granite rested
LINE 209: by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe
LINE 210: whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a
LINE 211: supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which
LINE 212: his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a
LINE 213: mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.
LINE 214: So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
LINE 215: sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as
LINE 216: I'm telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
LINE 217: —And there's more where that came from, says he.
LINE 218: —Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
LINE 219: —Sweat of my brow, says Joe. 'Twas the prudent member gave me the
LINE 220: wheeze.
LINE 221: —I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
LINE 222: Greek street with his cod's eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
LINE 223: Who comes through Michan's land, bedight in sable armour? O'Bloom, the
LINE 224: son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory's son: he of the
LINE 225: prudent soul.
LINE 226: —For the old woman of Prince's street, says the citizen, the subsidised
LINE 227: organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at
LINE 228: this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. _The Irish
LINE 229: Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman's
LINE 230: friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland
LINE 231: Independent,_ and I'll thank you and the marriages.
LINE 232: And he starts reading them out:
LINE 233: —Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne's
LINE 234: on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How's that, eh? Wright
LINE 235: and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the
LINE 236: late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and
LINE 237: Ridsdale at Saint Jude's, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,
LINE 238: dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London:
LINE 239: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the
LINE 240: Moat house, Chepstow...
LINE 241: —I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
LINE 242: —Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
LINE 243: Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
LINE 244: Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How's that for a national press, eh, my
LINE 245: brown son! How's that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
LINE 246: —Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had
LINE 247: the start of us. Drink that, citizen.
LINE 248: —I will, says he, honourable person.
LINE 249: —Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
LINE 250: Ah! Ow! Don't be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
LINE 251: Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
LINE 252: And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
LINE 253: swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
LINE 254: there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
LINE 255: scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
LINE 256: fairest of her race.
LINE 257: Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney's
LINE 258: snug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in
LINE 259: the corner that I hadn't seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
LINE 260: Doran. I didn't know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
LINE 261: door. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
LINE 262: in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter
LINE 263: and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting
LINE 264: like a poodle. I thought Alf would split.
LINE 265: —Look at him, says he. Breen. He's traipsing all round Dublin with a
LINE 266: postcard someone sent him with U. p: up on it to take a li...
LINE 267: And he doubled up.
LINE 268: —Take a what? says I.
LINE 269: —Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
LINE 270: —O hell! says I.
LINE 271: The bloody mongrel began to growl that'd put the fear of God in you
LINE 272: seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
LINE 273: _—Bi i dho husht,_ says he.
LINE 274: —Who? says Joe.
LINE 275: —Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton's and then he went round
LINE 276: to Collis and Ward's and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round
LINE 277: to the subsheriff's for a lark. O God, I've a pain laughing. U. p: up.
LINE 278: The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody
LINE 279: old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
LINE 280: —When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
LINE 281: —Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
LINE 282: —Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a
LINE 283: pony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen
LINE 284: long John's eye. U. p ....
LINE 285: And he started laughing.
LINE 286: —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
LINE 287: —Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
LINE 288: Terence O'Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full
LINE 289: of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
LINE 290: Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
LINE 291: deathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
LINE 292: mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
LINE 293: juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
LINE 294: from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
LINE 295: Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
LINE 296: that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
LINE 297: thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
LINE 298: But he, the young chief of the O'Bergan's, could ill brook to be
LINE 299: outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a
LINE 300: testoon of costliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork
LINE 301: was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of
LINE 302: Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of
LINE 303: God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the
LINE 304: British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress
LINE 305: of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the
LINE 306: wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to
LINE 307: the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
LINE 308: —What's that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
LINE 309: down outside?
LINE 310: —What's that? says Joe.
LINE 311: —Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,
LINE 312: I'll show you something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.
LINE 313: So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his
LINE 314: pocket.
LINE 315: —Are you codding? says I.
LINE 316: —Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
LINE 317: So Joe took up the letters.
LINE 318: —Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
LINE 319: So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. Bob's a queer chap when
LINE 320: the porter's up in him so says I just to make talk:
LINE 321: —How's Willy Murray those times, Alf?
LINE 322: —I don't know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
LINE 323: Dignam. Only I was running after that...
LINE 324: —You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
LINE 325: —With Dignam, says Alf.
LINE 326: —Is it Paddy? says Joe.
LINE 327: —Yes, says Alf. Why?
LINE 328: —Don't you know he's dead? says Joe.
LINE 329: —Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
LINE 330: —Ay, says Joe.
LINE 331: —Sure I'm after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as
LINE 332: a pikestaff.
LINE 333: —Who's dead? says Bob Doran.
LINE 334: —You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
LINE 335: —What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray
LINE 336: with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim's... What? Dignam
LINE 337: dead?
LINE 338: —What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who's talking about...?
LINE 339: —Dead! says Alf. He's no more dead than you are.
LINE 340: —Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning
LINE 341: anyhow.
LINE 342: —Paddy? says Alf.
LINE 343: —Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
LINE 344: —Good Christ! says Alf.
LINE 345: Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
LINE 346: In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
LINE 347: tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
LINE 348: luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
LINE 349: the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
LINE 350: of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was
LINE 351: effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the
LINE 352: orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar
LINE 353: plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the
LINE 354: heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return
LINE 355: but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty
LINE 356: entities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his
LINE 357: first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously
LINE 358: he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had
LINE 359: summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.
LINE 360: Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the
LINE 361: flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the
LINE 362: spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort
LINE 363: such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest
LINE 364: adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.
LINE 365: Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently
LINE 366: afforded relief. Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted
LINE 367: all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true
LINE 368: path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were
LINE 369: out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power. It was
LINE 370: then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the
LINE 371: defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are
LINE 372: still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn't pile it on._ It was ascertained
LINE 373: that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.
LINE 374: J. O'Neill's popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the
LINE 375: defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment
LINE 376: arrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to
LINE 377: his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for
LINE 378: was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair
LINE 379: should be sent to Cullen's to be soled only as the heels were still
LINE 380: good. He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in
LINE 381: the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made
LINE 382: known.
LINE 383: Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
LINE 384: intimated that this had given satisfaction.
LINE 385: He is gone from mortal haunts: O'Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was
LINE 386: his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with
LINE 387: your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
LINE 388: —There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
LINE 389: —Who? says I.
LINE 390: —Bloom, says he. He's on point duty up and down there for the last ten
LINE 391: minutes.
LINE 392: And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
LINE 393: Little Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
LINE 394: —Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
LINE 395: And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
LINE 396: blackguard in Dublin when he's under the influence:
LINE 397: —Who said Christ is good?
LINE 398: —I beg your parsnips, says Alf.
LINE 399: —Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
LINE 400: Dignam?
LINE 401: —Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He's over all his troubles.
LINE 402: But Bob Doran shouts out of him.
LINE 403: —He's a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
LINE 404: Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn't
LINE 405: want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob
LINE 406: Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you're there.
LINE 407: —The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
LINE 408: The tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat.
LINE 409: Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married,
LINE 410: Mooney, the bumbailiff's daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke
LINE 411: street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told
LINE 412: me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on
LINE 413: her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
LINE 414: —The noblest, the truest, says he. And he's gone, poor little Willy,
LINE 415: poor little Paddy Dignam.
LINE 416: And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
LINE 417: beam of heaven.
LINE 418: Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
LINE 419: the door.
LINE 420: —Come in, come on, he won't eat you, says the citizen.
LINE 421: So Bloom slopes in with his cod's eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
LINE 422: Martin Cunningham there.
LINE 423: —O, Christ M'Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to
LINE 424: this, will you?
LINE 425: And he starts reading out one.
LINE 426: _7 Hunter Street,
LINE 427: Liverpool._
LINE 428: _To the High Sheriff of Dublin,
LINE 429: Dublin._
LINE 430: _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
LINE 431: case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
LINE 432: hanged..._
LINE 433: —Show us, Joe, says I.
LINE 434: —_... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in
LINE 435: Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._
LINE 436: —Jesus, says I.
LINE 437: —_... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._
LINE 438: The citizen made a grab at the letter.
LINE 439: —Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once
LINE 440: in he can't get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my
LINE 441: terms is five ginnees._
LINE 442: _H. Rumbold,
LINE 443: Master Barber._
LINE 444: —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
LINE 445: —And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them
LINE 446: to hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you
LINE 447: have?
LINE 448: So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn't and
LINE 449: he couldn't and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said
LINE 450: well he'd just take a cigar. Gob, he's a prudent member and no mistake.
LINE 451: —Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
LINE 452: And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with
LINE 453: a black border round it.
LINE 454: —They're all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
LINE 455: their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
LINE 456: And he was telling us there's two fellows waiting below to pull his
LINE 457: heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
LINE 458: chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
LINE 459: In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their
LINE 460: deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
LINE 461: wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
LINE 462: saith the Lord.
LINE 463: So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
LINE 464: comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
LINE 465: business and the old dog smelling him all the time I'm told those
LINE 466: jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about
LINE 467: I don't know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
LINE 468: —There's one thing it hasn't a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
LINE 469: —What's that? says Joe.
LINE 470: —The poor bugger's tool that's being hanged, says Alf.
LINE 471: —That so? says Joe.
LINE 472: —God's truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
LINE 473: Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when
LINE 474: they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
LINE 475: a poker.
LINE 476: —Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
LINE 477: —That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It's only a natural
LINE 478: phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the...
LINE 479: And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science
LINE 480: and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
LINE 481: The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
LINE 482: medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
LINE 483: cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
LINE 484: according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
LINE 485: calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
LINE 486: ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
LINE 487: thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
LINE 488: dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
LINE 489: to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
LINE 490: resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
LINE 491: morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
LINE 492: mortis per diminutionem capitis._
LINE 493: So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
LINE 494: he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard
LINE 495: and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe
LINE 496: with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported
LINE 497: for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,
LINE 498: that and the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a
LINE 499: new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all
LINE 500: round the place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob
LINE 501: Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could
LINE 502: get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
LINE 503: —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
LINE 504: here! Give us the paw!
LINE 505: Arrah, bloody end to the paw he'd paw and Alf trying to keep him from
LINE 506: tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
LINE 507: all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
LINE 508: intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
LINE 509: bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs' tin he told Terry to
LINE 510: bring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
LINE 511: out of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry
LINE 512: bloody mongrel.
LINE 513: And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
LINE 514: brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
LINE 515: and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
LINE 516: she's far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
LINE 517: cigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he
LINE 518: married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.
LINE 519: Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me
LINE 520: there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and
LINE 521: Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing
LINE 522: bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating
LINE 523: meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and
LINE 524: taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of
LINE 525: Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought
LINE 526: him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him
LINE 527: the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn't near
LINE 528: roast him, it's a queer story, the old one, Bloom's wife and Mrs O'Dowd
LINE 529: that kept the hotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them
LINE 530: off chewing the fat. And Bloom with his _but don't you see?_ and _but
LINE 531: on the other hand_. And sure, more be token, the lout I'm told was in
LINE 532: Power's after, the blender's, round in Cope street going home footless
LINE 533: in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the
LINE 534: samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!
LINE 535: —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
LINE 536: glaring at Bloom.
LINE 537: —Ay, ay, says Joe.
LINE 538: —You don't grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
LINE 539: —_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen. _Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
LINE 540: are by our side and the foes we hate before us.
LINE 541: The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far
LINE 542: and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
LINE 543: gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
LINE 544: punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening
LINE 545: claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the
LINE 546: ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
LINE 547: supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain
LINE 548: poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared
LINE 549: heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest
LINE 550: computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin
LINE 551: Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
LINE 552: maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
LINE 553: reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
LINE 554: their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
LINE 555: the cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains
LINE 556: and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
LINE 557: country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable
LINE 558: amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
LINE 559: M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
LINE 560: mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
LINE 561: with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
LINE 562: who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will
LINE 563: grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and
LINE 564: Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the
LINE 565: scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's
LINE 566: entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the
LINE 567: Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and
LINE 568: motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal
LINE 569: houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their
LINE 570: Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while
LINE 571: the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald
LINE 572: Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation,
LINE 573: present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone
LINE 574: (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his
LINE 575: seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul
LINE 576: Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the
LINE 577: Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha
LINE 578: Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos
LINE 579: Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo
LINE 580: Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la
LINE 581: Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen,
LINE 582: Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr
LINE 583: Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident
LINE 584: Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,
LINE 585: Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge
LINE 586: neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the
LINE 587: delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
LINE 588: possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
LINE 589: they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which
LINE 590: all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth
LINE 591: or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's
LINE 592: patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
LINE 593: boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
LINE 594: catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
LINE 595: and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable
LINE 596: MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
LINE 597: restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
LINE 598: of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
LINE 599: parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to
LINE 600: all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily
LINE 601: congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of whom were bleeding
LINE 602: profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
LINE 603: underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
LINE 604: adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
LINE 605: thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
LINE 606: pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
LINE 607: senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and
LINE 608: gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
LINE 609: rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
LINE 610: Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
LINE 611: morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
LINE 612: Cruentus_. He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
LINE 613: which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking
LINE 614: yet withal so characteristic of the man. The arrival of the
LINE 615: worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
LINE 616: huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
LINE 617: their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
LINE 618: cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
LINE 619: chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
LINE 620: _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
LINE 621: those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani
LINE 622: beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It
LINE 623: was exactly seventeen o'clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly
LINE 624: given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the
LINE 625: commendatore's patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession
LINE 626: of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his
LINE 627: medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who
LINE 628: administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
LINE 629: about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a
LINE 630: pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to
LINE 631: the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hard by the block
LINE 632: stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in
LINE 633: a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which
LINE 634: his eyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested
LINE 635: the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or
LINE 636: decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
LINE 637: provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a
LINE 638: handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering
LINE 639: knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially
LINE 640: supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and
LINE 641: Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the
LINE 642: duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
LINE 643: extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most
LINE 644: precious blood of the most precious victim. The housesteward of the
LINE 645: amalgamated cats' and dogs' home was in attendance to convey these
LINE 646: vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution. Quite an
LINE 647: excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and
LINE 648: onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and
LINE 649: invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for
LINE 650: the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital
LINE 651: spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the
LINE 652: proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in
LINE 653: these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying
LINE 654: wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in
LINE 655: aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers'
LINE 656: association as a token of his regard and esteem. The _nec_ and _non
LINE 657: plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst
LINE 658: her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself
LINE 659: upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into
LINE 660: eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving
LINE 661: embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_. Encouraged by this use of
LINE 662: her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable
LINE 663: areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her
LINE 664: ardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of
LINE 665: their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would
LINE 666: never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips
LINE 667: as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She
LINE 668: brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
LINE 669: together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
LINE 670: innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
LINE 671: they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
LINE 672: pastor, joining in the general merriment. That monster audience simply
LINE 673: rocked with delight. But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
LINE 674: their hands for the last time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from
LINE 675: their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the
LINE 676: inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being
LINE 677: the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and
LINE 678: genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
LINE 679: their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
LINE 680: in that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a
LINE 681: handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
LINE 682: sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and
LINE 683: genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
LINE 684: requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every
LINE 685: lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the
LINE 686: occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and
LINE 687: generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the
LINE 688: gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most
LINE 689: timehonoured names in Albion's history) placed on the finger of his
LINE 690: blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in
LINE 691: the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay,
LINE 692: even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell
LINE 693: ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had
LINE 694: blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without
LINE 695: flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion. With his mailed
LINE 696: gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those
LINE 697: privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to
LINE 698: murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
LINE 699: —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it
LINE 700: makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
LINE 701: I thinks of my old mashtub what's waiting for me down Limehouse way.
LINE 702: So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
LINE 703: corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can't speak
LINE 704: their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
LINE 705: quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he
LINE 706: cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
LINE 707: antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is
LINE 708: about the size of it. Gob, he'd let you pour all manner of drink down
LINE 709: his throat till the Lord would call him before you'd ever see the froth
LINE 710: of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
LINE 711: musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
LINE 712: hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
LINE 713: blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
LINE 714: bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and
LINE 715: oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
LINE 716: entertainment, don't be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And
LINE 717: then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
LINE 718: shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two
LINE 719: sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
LINE 720: females, hitting below the belt.
LINE 721: So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
LINE 722: starts mousing around by Joe and me. I'd train him by kindness, so I
LINE 723: would, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
LINE 724: where it wouldn't blind him.
LINE 725: —Afraid he'll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.
LINE 726: —No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
LINE 727: So he calls the old dog over.
LINE 728: —What's on you, Garry? says he.
LINE 729: Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
LINE 730: old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
LINE 731: Such growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone
LINE 732: that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono
LINE 733: publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of
LINE 734: that. Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth
LINE 735: is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.
LINE 736: All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
LINE 737: lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
LINE 738: missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
LINE 739: famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_
LINE 740: of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends
LINE 741: and acquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of
LINE 742: years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary
LINE 743: system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.
LINE 744: Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from
LINE 745: us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and
LINE 746: compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_
LINE 747: resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic
LINE 748: bards. We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with
LINE 749: which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym
LINE 750: of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but
LINE 751: rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting
LINE 752: communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and
LINE 753: more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the
LINE 754: famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
LINE 755: modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. We subjoin a
LINE 756: specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar
LINE 757: whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we
LINE 758: believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more
LINE 759: than an indication. The metrical system of the canine original, which
LINE 760: recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh
LINE 761: englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will
LINE 762: agree that the spirit has been well caught. Perhaps it should be added
LINE 763: that the effect is greatly increased if Owen's verse be spoken somewhat
LINE 764: slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.
LINE 765: The curse of my curses
LINE 766: Seven days every day
LINE 767: And seven dry Thursdays
LINE 768: On you, Barney Kiernan,
LINE 769: Has no sup of water
LINE 770: To cool my courage,
LINE 771: And my guts red roaring
LINE 772: After Lowry's lights.
LINE 773: So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
LINE 774: hear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have
LINE 775: another.
LINE 776: —I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there's no ill feeling.
LINE 777: Gob, he's not as green as he's cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one
LINE 778: pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap's dog
LINE 779: and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for
LINE 780: man and beast. And says Joe:
LINE 781: —Could you make a hole in another pint?
LINE 782: —Could a swim duck? says I.
LINE 783: —Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won't have anything in
LINE 784: the way of liquid refreshment? says he.
LINE 785: —Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
LINE 786: Martin Cunningham, don't you see, about this insurance of poor
LINE 787: Dignam's. Martin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I
LINE 788: mean, didn't serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the
LINE 789: time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can't recover on the
LINE 790: policy.
LINE 791: —Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that's a good one if old Shylock is
LINE 792: landed. So the wife comes out top dog, what?
LINE 793: —Well, that's a point, says Bloom, for the wife's admirers.
LINE 794: —Whose admirers? says Joe.
LINE 795: —The wife's advisers, I mean, says Bloom.
LINE 796: Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
LINE 797: like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
LINE 798: of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
LINE 799: Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
LINE 800: contested the mortgagee's right till he near had the head of me addled
LINE 801: with his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn't run in
LINE 802: himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
LINE 803: friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
LINE 804: Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you're there. O, commend me to an
LINE 805: israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
LINE 806: So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
LINE 807: was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
LINE 808: to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
LINE 809: never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that's dead to tell her.
LINE 810: Choking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom's hand doing the tragic
LINE 811: to tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You're a rogue and I'm another.
LINE 812: —Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
LINE 813: slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
LINE 814: founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to
LINE 815: request of you this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits
LINE 816: of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my
LINE 817: boldness.
LINE 818: —No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
LINE 819: actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me
LINE 820: consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
LINE 821: this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness
LINE 822: of the cup.
LINE 823: —Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,
LINE 824: I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
LINE 825: expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
LINE 826: poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
LINE 827: speech.
LINE 828: And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
LINE 829: o'clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
LINE 830: bobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
LINE 831: closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard,
LINE 832: drinking porter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the
LINE 833: shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he
LINE 834: serving mass in Adam and Eve's when he was young with his eyes shut,
LINE 835: who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and
LINE 836: smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his
LINE 837: pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed
LINE 838: and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another. _How is your
LINE 839: testament? Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing
LINE 840: there, I tell you what. Then see him of a Sunday with his little
LINE 841: concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the
LINE 842: chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as
LINE 843: pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney's sister. And the old
LINE 844: prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack
LINE 845: made him toe the line. Told him if he didn't patch up the pot, Jesus,
LINE 846: he'd kick the shite out of him.
LINE 847: So Terry brought the three pints.
LINE 848: —Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.
LINE 849: —_Slan leat_, says he.
LINE 850: —Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.
LINE 851: Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small
LINE 852: fortune to keep him in drinks.
LINE 853: —Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.
LINE 854: —Friend of yours, says Alf.
LINE 855: —Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?
LINE 856: —I won't mention any names, says Alf.
LINE 857: —I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William
LINE 858: Field, M. P., the cattle traders.
LINE 859: —Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
LINE 860: all countries and the idol of his own.
LINE 861: So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and
LINE 862: the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
LINE 863: sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
LINE 864: sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
LINE 865: guaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a
LINE 866: knacker's yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here's my head
LINE 867: and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
LINE 868: for giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how
LINE 869: to milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
LINE 870: to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O'Dowd crying her eyes out
LINE 871: with her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn't loosen her farting
LINE 872: strings but old cod's eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
LINE 873: it. What's your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor
LINE 874: animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn't
LINE 875: cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,
LINE 876: he'd have a soft hand under a hen.
LINE 877: Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for
LINE 878: us. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then
LINE 879: comes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her
LINE 880: fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.
LINE 881: —Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
LINE 882: to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.
LINE 883: —Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see
LINE 884: him, as it happens.
LINE 885: —Well, he's going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
LINE 886: —That's too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr
LINE 887: Field is going. I couldn't phone. No. You're sure?
LINE 888: —Nannan's going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question
LINE 889: tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
LINE 890: park. What do you think of that, citizen? _The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.
LINE 891: Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of my
LINE 892: honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
LINE 893: honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that
LINE 894: these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is
LINE 895: forthcoming as to their pathological condition?
LINE 896: Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in
LINE 897: possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
LINE 898: house. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the
LINE 899: honourable member's question is in the affirmative.
LINE 900: Mr Orelli O'Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
LINE 901: for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
LINE 902: Phoenix park?
LINE 903: Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.
LINE 904: Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman's famous
LINE 905: Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
LINE 906: bench? (O! O!)
LINE 907: Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.
LINE 908: Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don't hesitate to shoot.
LINE 909: (Ironical opposition cheers.)
LINE 910: The speaker: Order! Order!
LINE 911: (The house rises. Cheers.)
LINE 912: —There's the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There
LINE 913: he is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion
LINE 914: of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best
LINE 915: throw, citizen?
LINE 916: —_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a
LINE 917: time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.
LINE 918: —Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.
LINE 919: —Is that really a fact? says Alf.
LINE 920: —Yes, says Bloom. That's well known. Did you not know that?
LINE 921: So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
LINE 922: lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
LINE 923: and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course
LINE 924: Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart
LINE 925: violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a
LINE 926: straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.
LINE 927: Do you see that straw? That's a straw_. Declare to my aunt he'd talk
LINE 928: about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.
LINE 929: A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
LINE 930: O'Ciarnain's_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
LINE 931: _Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
LINE 932: importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
LINE 933: ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The
LINE 934: venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
LINE 935: attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by
LINE 936: the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
LINE 937: a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high
LINE 938: standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the
LINE 939: revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic
LINE 940: forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of
LINE 941: our old tongue, Mr Joseph M'Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
LINE 942: the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised
LINE 943: morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best
LINE 944: traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient
LINE 945: ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,
LINE 946: having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
LINE 947: discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
LINE 948: plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
LINE 949: rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis' evergreen verses
LINE 950: (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in
LINE 951: the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without
LINE 952: fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish
LINE 953: Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were
LINE 954: heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only
LINE 955: our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its
LINE 956: superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was
LINE 957: vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be
LINE 958: noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives
LINE 959: of the press and the bar and the other learned professions. The
LINE 960: proceedings then terminated.
LINE 961: Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.
LINE 962: L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.
LINE 963: Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.
LINE 964: P. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.
LINE 965: Nicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.
LINE 966: Maher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery,
LINE 967: V. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O.
LINE 968: M.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the rev.
LINE 969: M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr
LINE 970: M'Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M. D.
LINE 971: Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy
LINE 972: canon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P.
LINE 973: Fay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.
LINE 974: —Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
LINE 975: Keogh-Bennett match?
LINE 976: —No, says Joe.
LINE 977: —I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
LINE 978: —Who? Blazes? says Joe.
LINE 979: And says Bloom:
LINE 980: —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training
LINE 981: the eye.
LINE 982: —Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
LINE 983: the odds and he swatting all the time.
LINE 984: —We know him, says the citizen. The traitor's son. We know what put
LINE 985: English gold in his pocket.
LINE 986: —True for you, says Joe.
LINE 987: And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
LINE 988: blood, asking Alf:
LINE 989: —Now, don't you think, Bergan?
LINE 990: —Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only
LINE 991: a bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See
LINE 992: the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,
LINE 993: he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
LINE 994: him puke what he never ate.
LINE 995: It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were
LINE 996: scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.
LINE 997: Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin's pet lamb made up
LINE 998: for it by superlative skill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks
LINE 999: was a gruelling for both champions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had
LINE 1000: tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had
LINE 1001: been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in
LINE 1002: some neat work on the pet's nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The
LINE 1003: soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which
LINE 1004: the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the
LINE 1005: point of Bennett's jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him
LINE 1006: with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to
LINE 1007: handigrips. Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout
LINE 1008: ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The
LINE 1009: Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he
LINE 1010: was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey
LINE 1011: and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in
LINE 1012: jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two
LINE 1013: fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. The referee twice
LINE 1014: cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his
LINE 1015: footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies during
LINE 1016: which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from
LINE 1017: his opponent's mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
LINE 1018: landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett's stomach, flooring him
LINE 1019: flat. It was a knockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the
LINE 1020: Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett's second Ole
LINE 1021: Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared
LINE 1022: victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the
LINE 1023: ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.
LINE 1024: —He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he's
LINE 1025: running a concert tour now up in the north.
LINE 1026: —He is, says Joe. Isn't he?
LINE 1027: —Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That's quite true. Yes, a kind of summer
LINE 1028: tour, you see. Just a holiday.
LINE 1029: —Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn't she? says Joe.
LINE 1030: —My wife? says Bloom. She's singing, yes. I think it will be a success
LINE 1031: too. He's an excellent man to organise. Excellent.
LINE 1032: Hoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the
LINE 1033: cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal's chest. Blazes doing the
LINE 1034: tootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger's son off
LINE 1035: Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to
LINE 1036: fight the Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate,
LINE 1037: Mr Boylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That's
LINE 1038: the bucko that'll organise her, take my tip. 'Twixt me and you
LINE 1039: Caddareesh.
LINE 1040: Pride of Calpe's rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There
LINE 1041: grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The
LINE 1042: gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.
LINE 1043: The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
LINE 1044: And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O'Molloy's, a comely hero
LINE 1045: of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty's counsel learned
LINE 1046: in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
LINE 1047: Lambert.
LINE 1048: —Hello, Ned.
LINE 1049: —Hello, Alf.
LINE 1050: —Hello, Jack.
LINE 1051: —Hello, Joe.
LINE 1052: —God save you, says the citizen.
LINE 1053: —Save you kindly, says J. J. What'll it be, Ned?
LINE 1054: —Half one, says Ned.
LINE 1055: So J. J. ordered the drinks.
LINE 1056: —Were you round at the court? says Joe.
LINE 1057: —Yes, says J. J. He'll square that, Ned, says he.
LINE 1058: —Hope so, says Ned.
LINE 1059: Now what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list
LINE 1060: and the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs's.
LINE 1061: Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their
LINE 1062: eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee
LINE 1063: orders. Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where
LINE 1064: no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with
LINE 1065: Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop. What's your name, sir?
LINE 1066: Dunne, says he. Ay, and done says I. Gob, he'll come home by weeping
LINE 1067: cross one of those days, I'm thinking.
LINE 1068: —Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U. p: up.
LINE 1069: —Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.
LINE 1070: —Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
LINE 1071: Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting
LINE 1072: examined first.
LINE 1073: —Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I'd give anything to
LINE 1074: hear him before a judge and jury.
LINE 1075: —Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and
LINE 1076: nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
LINE 1077: —Me? says Alf. Don't cast your nasturtiums on my character.
LINE 1078: —Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
LINE 1079: against you.
LINE 1080: —Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not
LINE 1081: _compos mentis_. U. p: up.
LINE 1082: _—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he's balmy?
LINE 1083: Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat
LINE 1084: on with a shoehorn.
LINE 1085: —Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
LINE 1086: indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
LINE 1087: —Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.
LINE 1088: —Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
LINE 1089: —Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half
LINE 1090: and half.
LINE 1091: —How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...
LINE 1092: —Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that's neither fish
LINE 1093: nor flesh.
LINE 1094: —Nor good red herring, says Joe.
LINE 1095: —That what's I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what
LINE 1096: that is.
LINE 1097: Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on
LINE 1098: account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old
LINE 1099: stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
LINE 1100: povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
LINE 1101: bringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she
LINE 1102: married him because a cousin of his old fellow's was pewopener to the
LINE 1103: pope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney's
LINE 1104: moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal
LINE 1105: Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.
LINE 1106: And who was he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven
LINE 1107: shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding
LINE 1108: defiance to the world.
LINE 1109: —And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be
LINE 1110: sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my
LINE 1111: opinion an action might lie.
LINE 1112: Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our
LINE 1113: pints in peace. Gob, we won't be let even do that much itself.
LINE 1114: —Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
LINE 1115: —Good health, Ned, says J. J.
LINE 1116: —-There he is again, says Joe.
LINE 1117: —Where? says Alf.
LINE 1118: And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
LINE 1119: and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
LINE 1120: as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
LINE 1121: secondhand coffin.
LINE 1122: —How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
LINE 1123: —Remanded, says J. J.
LINE 1124: One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
LINE 1125: Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
LINE 1126: saying he'd give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see
LINE 1127: any green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?
LINE 1128: Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
LINE 1129: his own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
LINE 1130: Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
LINE 1131: swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
LINE 1132: —Who tried the case? says Joe.
LINE 1133: —Recorder, says Ned.
LINE 1134: —Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
LINE 1135: —Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
LINE 1136: of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he'll dissolve
LINE 1137: in tears on the bench.
LINE 1138: —Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn't clap him in the dock
LINE 1139: the other day for suing poor little Gumley that's minding stones, for
LINE 1140: the corporation there near Butt bridge.
LINE 1141: And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
LINE 1142: —A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?
LINE 1143: Ten, did you say?
LINE 1144: —Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
LINE 1145: —And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
LINE 1146: immediately, sir. No, sir, I'll make no order for payment. How dare
LINE 1147: you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor
LINE 1148: hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.
LINE 1149: And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and
LINE 1150: in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
LINE 1151: the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
LINE 1152: quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
LINE 1153: halls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
LINE 1154: his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
LINE 1155: probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
LINE 1156: chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
LINE 1157: final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of
LINE 1158: the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus
LINE 1159: Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn
LINE 1160: court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat
LINE 1161: him there about the hour of five o'clock to administer the law of the
LINE 1162: brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in
LINE 1163: and for the county of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the
LINE 1164: high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of
LINE 1165: the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen
LINE 1166: and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of
LINE 1167: Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the
LINE 1168: tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte
LINE 1169: and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and
LINE 1170: true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should
LINE 1171: well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined
LINE 1172: between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and
LINE 1173: true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss
LINE 1174: the book. And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they
LINE 1175: swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
LINE 1176: rightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
LINE 1177: their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
LINE 1178: in consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and
LINE 1179: foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
LINE 1180: against him for he was a malefactor.
LINE 1181: —Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
LINE 1182: filling the country with bugs.
LINE 1183: So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
LINE 1184: telling him he needn't trouble about that little matter till the first
LINE 1185: but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high
LINE 1186: and holy by this and by that he'd do the devil and all.
LINE 1187: —Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
LINE 1188: repetition. That's the whole secret.
LINE 1189: —Rely on me, says Joe.
LINE 1190: —Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We
LINE 1191: want no more strangers in our house.
LINE 1192: —O, I'm sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It's just that
LINE 1193: Keyes, you see.
LINE 1194: —Consider that done, says Joe.
LINE 1195: —Very kind of you, says Bloom.
LINE 1196: —The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.
LINE 1197: We brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
LINE 1198: robbers here.
LINE 1199: —Decree _nisi,_ says J. J.
LINE 1200: And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
LINE 1201: spider's web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
LINE 1202: after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite
LINE 1203: and when.
LINE 1204: —A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that's what's the cause of all
LINE 1205: our misfortunes.
LINE 1206: —And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_
LINE 1207: with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
LINE 1208: —Give us a squint at her, says I.
LINE 1209: And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows
LINE 1210: off of Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts.
LINE 1211: Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago
LINE 1212: contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.
LINE 1213: Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling
LINE 1214: for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter
LINE 1215: just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with
LINE 1216: officer Taylor.
LINE 1217: —O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
LINE 1218: —There's hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
LINE 1219: of that one, what?
LINE 1220: So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
LINE 1221: him as long as a late breakfast.
LINE 1222: —Well, says the citizen, what's the latest from the scene of action?
LINE 1223: What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
LINE 1224: about the Irish language?
LINE 1225: O'Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
LINE 1226: puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
LINE 1227: that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
LINE 1228: city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there,
LINE 1229: after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken
LINE 1230: solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once
LINE 1231: more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided
LINE 1232: Gael.
LINE 1233: —It's on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal
LINE 1234: Sassenachs and their _patois._
LINE 1235: So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
LINE 1236: you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting
LINE 1237: your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to
LINE 1238: impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and
LINE 1239: botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.
LINE 1240: —Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them!
LINE 1241: The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody
LINE 1242: thicklugged sons of whores' gets! No music and no art and no literature
LINE 1243: worthy of the name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us.
LINE 1244: Tonguetied sons of bastards' ghosts.
LINE 1245: —The European family, says J. J....
LINE 1246: —They're not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin
LINE 1247: Egan of Paris. You wouldn't see a trace of them or their language
LINE 1248: anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d'aisance._
LINE 1249: And says John Wyse:
LINE 1250: —Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
LINE 1251: And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
LINE 1252: —_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_
LINE 1253: He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
LINE 1254: medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh
LINE 1255: Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
LINE 1256: valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
LINE 1257: silent as the deathless gods.
LINE 1258: —What's up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had
LINE 1259: lost a bob and found a tanner.
LINE 1260: —Gold cup, says he.
LINE 1261: —Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
LINE 1262: _—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest
LINE 1263: nowhere.
LINE 1264: —And Bass's mare? says Terry.
LINE 1265: —Still running, says he. We're all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid
LINE 1266: on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.
LINE 1267: —I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn
LINE 1268: gave me. Lord Howard de Walden's.
LINE 1269: —Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. _Throwaway,_
LINE 1270: says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy
LINE 1271: name is _Sceptre._
LINE 1272: So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
LINE 1273: anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
LINE 1274: luck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
LINE 1275: —Not there, my child, says he.
LINE 1276: —Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She'd have won the money only for the
LINE 1277: other dog.
LINE 1278: And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
LINE 1279: sticking in an odd word.
LINE 1280: —Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others' eyes but they
LINE 1281: can't see the beam in their own.
LINE 1282: —_Raimeis_, says the citizen. There's no-one as blind as the fellow
LINE 1283: that won't see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing
LINE 1284: twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost
LINE 1285: tribes? And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world!
LINE 1286: And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax
LINE 1287: and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our
LINE 1288: tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our
LINE 1289: Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk
LINE 1290: and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite
LINE 1291: convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are
LINE 1292: the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the
LINE 1293: Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian
LINE 1294: purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and
LINE 1295: Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble,
LINE 1296: silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today,
LINE 1297: the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs
LINE 1298: duties for the right to fish in our waters. What do the yellowjohns of
LINE 1299: Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths? And the beds
LINE 1300: of the Barrow and Shannon they won't deepen with millions of acres of
LINE 1301: marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?
LINE 1302: —As treeless as Portugal we'll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
LINE 1303: with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.
LINE 1304: Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I
LINE 1305: was reading a report of lord Castletown's...
LINE 1306: —Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
LINE 1307: elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the
LINE 1308: trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
LINE 1309: Eire, O.
LINE 1310: —Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
LINE 1311: The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon
LINE 1312: at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
LINE 1313: ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
LINE 1314: Valley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,
LINE 1315: Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs
LINE 1316: Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss
LINE 1317: Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche
LINE 1318: Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower,
LINE 1319: Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel
LINE 1320: Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,
LINE 1321: Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs
LINE 1322: Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of
LINE 1323: Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was
LINE 1324: given away by her father, the M'Conifer of the Glands, looked
LINE 1325: exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised
LINE 1326: silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of
LINE 1327: broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,
LINE 1328: the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn
LINE 1329: bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce
LINE 1330: Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same
LINE 1331: tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a
LINE 1332: pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form
LINE 1333: of heron feathers of paletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at
LINE 1334: the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed
LINE 1335: numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of
LINE 1336: _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service. On leaving
LINE 1337: the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the
LINE 1338: happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,
LINE 1339: beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,
LINE 1340: mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan
LINE 1341: will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
LINE 1342: —And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with
LINE 1343: Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
LINE 1344: pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
LINE 1345: —And will again, says Joe.
LINE 1346: —And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
LINE 1347: citizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full
LINE 1348: again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
LINE 1349: of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a
LINE 1350: fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O'Reillys and the
LINE 1351: O'Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
LINE 1352: the emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when
LINE 1353: the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own
LINE 1354: flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor's harps, no, the oldest flag
LINE 1355: afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns
LINE 1356: on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.
LINE 1357: And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like
LINE 1358: a tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody
LINE 1359: life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
LINE 1360: multitude in Shanagolden where he daren't show his nose with the Molly
LINE 1361: Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
LINE 1362: holding of an evicted tenant.
LINE 1363: —Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?
LINE 1364: —An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
LINE 1365: —Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you
LINE 1366: asleep?
LINE 1367: —Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
LINE 1368: Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead
LINE 1369: of attending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying
LINE 1370: to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his
LINE 1371: head down like a bull at a gate. And another one: _Black Beast Burned
LINE 1372: in Omaha, Ga_. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing
LINE 1373: at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
LINE 1374: him. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
LINE 1375: crucify him to make sure of their job.
LINE 1376: —But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
LINE 1377: bay?
LINE 1378: —I'll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.
LINE 1379: Read the revelations that's going on in the papers about flogging on
LINE 1380: the training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself
LINE 1381: _Disgusted One_.
LINE 1382: So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of
LINE 1383: tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
LINE 1384: parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
LINE 1385: brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend
LINE 1386: of a gun.
LINE 1387: —A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
LINE 1388: Beresford called it but the modern God's Englishman calls it caning on
LINE 1389: the breech.
LINE 1390: And says John Wyse:
LINE 1391: —'Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
LINE 1392: Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
LINE 1393: and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
LINE 1394: till he yells meila murder.
LINE 1395: —That's your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
LINE 1396: earth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary
LINE 1397: chamber on the face of God's earth and their land in the hands of a
LINE 1398: dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That's the great empire they
LINE 1399: boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.
LINE 1400: —On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
LINE 1401: —And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The
LINE 1402: unfortunate yahoos believe it.
LINE 1403: They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
LINE 1404: and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
LINE 1405: born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was
LINE 1406: scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day
LINE 1407: he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend
LINE 1408: till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be
LINE 1409: paid.
LINE 1410: —But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn't
LINE 1411: it be the same here if you put force against force?
LINE 1412: Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his
LINE 1413: last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living.
LINE 1414: —We'll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater
LINE 1415: Ireland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the
LINE 1416: black 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
LINE 1417: low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
LINE 1418: whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
LINE 1419: redskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the
LINE 1420: Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
LINE 1421: crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,
LINE 1422: they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in
LINE 1423: the coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember
LINE 1424: the land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
LINE 1425: cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
LINE 1426: —Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...
LINE 1427: —We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the
LINE 1428: poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
LINE 1429: Killala.
LINE 1430: —Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
LINE 1431: against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the
LINE 1432: broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
LINE 1433: wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan
LINE 1434: in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
LINE 1435: Teresa. But what did we ever get for it?
LINE 1436: —The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what
LINE 1437: it is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren't they
LINE 1438: trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay's dinnerparty with
LINE 1439: perfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.
LINE 1440: —_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
LINE 1441: —And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven't we
LINE 1442: had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George
LINE 1443: the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that's
LINE 1444: dead?
LINE 1445: Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old
LINE 1446: one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every
LINE 1447: night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman
LINE 1448: carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by
LINE 1449: the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the
LINE 1450: Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.
LINE 1451: —Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
LINE 1452: —Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There's a bloody sight more pox
LINE 1453: than pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!
LINE 1454: —And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
LINE 1455: bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
LINE 1456: Majesty's racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
LINE 1457: jockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.
LINE 1458: —They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
LINE 1459: Alf.
LINE 1460: And says J. J.:
LINE 1461: —Considerations of space influenced their lordships' decision.
LINE 1462: —Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
LINE 1463: —Yes, sir, says he. I will.
LINE 1464: —You? says Joe.
LINE 1465: —Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
LINE 1466: —Repeat that dose, says Joe.
LINE 1467: Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
LINE 1468: his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling
LINE 1469: about.
LINE 1470: —Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.
LINE 1471: Perpetuating national hatred among nations.
LINE 1472: —But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
LINE 1473: —Yes, says Bloom.
LINE 1474: —What is it? says John Wyse.
LINE 1475: —A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same
LINE 1476: place.
LINE 1477: —By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that's so I'm a nation for I'm
LINE 1478: living in the same place for the past five years.
LINE 1479: So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to
LINE 1480: muck out of it:
LINE 1481: —Or also living in different places.
LINE 1482: —That covers my case, says Joe.
LINE 1483: —What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.
LINE 1484: —Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.
LINE 1485: The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
LINE 1486: gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.
LINE 1487: —After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
LINE 1488: swab himself dry.
LINE 1489: —Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and
LINE 1490: repeat after me the following words.
LINE 1491: The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
LINE 1492: attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,
LINE 1493: authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and
LINE 1494: called forth prolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary
LINE 1495: beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly
LINE 1496: discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the
LINE 1497: four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American
LINE 1498: puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said
LINE 1499: in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The
LINE 1500: scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and
LINE 1501: raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive
LINE 1502: stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as
LINE 1503: when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy
LINE 1504: long long ago in the time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely
LINE 1505: lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh
LINE 1506: and the Twelve Pins, Ireland's Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh
LINE 1507: Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company
LINE 1508: (Limited), Lough Neagh's banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde's tower, the
LINE 1509: Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun's hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of
LINE 1510: Aherlow, Lynch's castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at
LINE 1511: Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids,
LINE 1512: Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury's Hotel, S.
LINE 1513: Patrick's Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory,
LINE 1514: Curley's hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington,
LINE 1515: the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse,
LINE 1516: Fingal's Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today
LINE 1517: rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed
LINE 1518: over them and by the rich incrustations of time.
LINE 1519: —Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
LINE 1520: —That's mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
LINE 1521: —And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.
LINE 1522: Also now. This very moment. This very instant.
LINE 1523: Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.
LINE 1524: —Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs
LINE 1525: to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
LINE 1526: by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.
LINE 1527: —Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
LINE 1528: —I'm talking about injustice, says Bloom.
LINE 1529: —Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
LINE 1530: That's an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old
LINE 1531: lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he'd adorn a
LINE 1532: sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse's apron on him. And
LINE 1533: then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as
LINE 1534: limp as a wet rag.
LINE 1535: —But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not
LINE 1536: life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that
LINE 1537: it's the very opposite of that that is really life.
LINE 1538: —What? says Alf.
LINE 1539: —Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says
LINE 1540: he to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
LINE 1541: there. If he comes just say I'll be back in a second. Just a moment.
LINE 1542: Who's hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.
LINE 1543: —A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
LINE 1544: —Well, says John Wyse. Isn't that what we're told. Love your neighbour.
LINE 1545: —That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,
LINE 1546: moya! He's a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.
LINE 1547: Love loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A
LINE 1548: loves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.
LINE 1549: M. B. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.
LINE 1550: Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with
LINE 1551: the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man
LINE 1552: in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King
LINE 1553: loves Her Majesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor.
LINE 1554: You love a certain person. And this person loves that other person
LINE 1555: because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.
LINE 1556: —Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power,
LINE 1557: citizen.
LINE 1558: —Hurrah, there, says Joe.
LINE 1559: —The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
LINE 1560: And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.
LINE 1561: —We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.
LINE 1562: What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women
LINE 1563: and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_
LINE 1564: pasted round the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit
LINE 1565: in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that's visiting
LINE 1566: England?
LINE 1567: —What's that? says Joe.
LINE 1568: So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
LINE 1569: reading out:
LINE 1570: —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
LINE 1571: yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in
LINE 1572: Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the
LINE 1573: heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in
LINE 1574: his dominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of
LINE 1575: which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely
LINE 1576: translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod
LINE 1577: Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the
LINE 1578: cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire,
LINE 1579: stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an
LINE 1580: illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of
LINE 1581: England's greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief
LINE 1582: woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the
LINE 1583: august hand of the Royal Donor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of
LINE 1584: firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of
LINE 1585: his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty
LINE 1586: Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and
LINE 1587: signed his mark in the visitors' book, subsequently executing a
LINE 1588: charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed
LINE 1589: several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.
LINE 1590: —Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn't doubt her. Wonder did he put that
LINE 1591: bible to the same use as I would.
LINE 1592: —Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land
LINE 1593: the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.
LINE 1594: —Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
LINE 1595: —No, says the citizen. It's not signed Shanganagh. It's only
LINE 1596: initialled: P.
LINE 1597: —And a very good initial too, says Joe.
LINE 1598: —That's how it's worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
LINE 1599: —Well, says J. J., if they're any worse than those Belgians in the
LINE 1600: Congo Free State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man
LINE 1601: what's this his name is?
LINE 1602: —Casement, says the citizen. He's an Irishman.
LINE 1603: —Yes, that's the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and
LINE 1604: flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they
LINE 1605: can out of them.
LINE 1606: —I know where he's gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
LINE 1607: —Who? says I.
LINE 1608: —Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on
LINE 1609: _Throwaway_ and he's gone to gather in the shekels.
LINE 1610: —Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a
LINE 1611: horse in anger in his life?
LINE 1612: —That's where he's gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back
LINE 1613: that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.
LINE 1614: Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He's the
LINE 1615: only man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.
LINE 1616: —He's a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
LINE 1617: —Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
LINE 1618: —There you are, says Terry.
LINE 1619: Goodbye Ireland I'm going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the
LINE 1620: yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
LINE 1621: letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
LINE 1622: to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
LINE 1623: Slattery's off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
LINE 1624: is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was
LINE 1625: telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
LINE 1626: done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she's
LINE 1627: better_ or _she's_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool
LINE 1628: if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!)
LINE 1629: Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody
LINE 1630: (there's the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.
LINE 1631: So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
LINE 1632: was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
LINE 1633: all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
LINE 1634: of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
LINE 1635: about selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that
LINE 1636: puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.
LINE 1637: Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
LINE 1638: mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before
LINE 1639: him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
LINE 1640: poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country
LINE 1641: with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.
LINE 1642: Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No
LINE 1643: security. Gob, he's like Lanty MacHale's goat that'd go a piece of the
LINE 1644: road with every one.
LINE 1645: —Well, it's a fact, says John Wyse. And there's the man now that'll
LINE 1646: tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.
LINE 1647: Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
LINE 1648: with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the
LINE 1649: collector general's, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
LINE 1650: registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
LINE 1651: country at the king's expense.
LINE 1652: Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
LINE 1653: palfreys.
LINE 1654: —Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
LINE 1655: Saucy knave! To us!
LINE 1656: So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
LINE 1657: Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.
LINE 1658: —Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
LINE 1659: —Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.
LINE 1660: And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.
LINE 1661: —Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
LINE 1662: larder. I know not what to offer your lordships.
LINE 1663: —How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
LINE 1664: countenance, So servest thou the king's messengers, master Taptun?
LINE 1665: An instantaneous change overspread the landlord's visage.
LINE 1666: —Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king's
LINE 1667: messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The
LINE 1668: king's friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
LINE 1669: house I warrant me.
LINE 1670: —Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty
LINE 1671: trencherman by his aspect. Hast aught to give us?
LINE 1672: Mine host bowed again as he made answer:
LINE 1673: —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
LINE 1674: venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog's bacon, a boar's
LINE 1675: head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a
LINE 1676: flagon of old Rhenish?
LINE 1677: —Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
LINE 1678: —Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare
LINE 1679: larder, quotha! 'Tis a merry rogue.
LINE 1680: So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.
LINE 1681: —Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
LINE 1682: —Isn't that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen
LINE 1683: about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?
LINE 1684: —That's so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
LINE 1685: —Who made those allegations? says Alf.
LINE 1686: —I, says Joe. I'm the alligator.
LINE 1687: —And after all, says John Wyse, why can't a jew love his country like
LINE 1688: the next fellow?
LINE 1689: —Why not? says J. J., when he's quite sure which country it is.
LINE 1690: —Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the
LINE 1691: hell is he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.
LINE 1692: —Who is Junius? says J. J.
LINE 1693: —We don't want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
LINE 1694: —He's a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
LINE 1695: he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know
LINE 1696: that in the castle.
LINE 1697: —Isn't he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
LINE 1698: —Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the
LINE 1699: father's name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the
LINE 1700: father did.
LINE 1701: —That's the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints
LINE 1702: and sages!
LINE 1703: —Well, they're still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that
LINE 1704: matter so are we.
LINE 1705: —Yes, says J. J., and every male that's born they think it may be their
LINE 1706: Messiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe,
LINE 1707: till he knows if he's a father or a mother.
LINE 1708: —Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
LINE 1709: —O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
LINE 1710: that died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying
LINE 1711: a tin of Neave's food six weeks before the wife was delivered.
LINE 1712: —_En ventre sa mère_, says J. J.
LINE 1713: —Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
LINE 1714: —I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
LINE 1715: —Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
LINE 1716: —And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
LINE 1717: Gob, there's many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed
LINE 1718: middlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
LINE 1719: month with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I'm
LINE 1720: telling you? It'd be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
LINE 1721: of that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it
LINE 1722: would. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
LINE 1723: stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind
LINE 1724: your eye.
LINE 1725: —Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can't wait.
LINE 1726: —A wolf in sheep's clothing, says the citizen. That's what he is. Virag
LINE 1727: from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.
LINE 1728: —Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
LINE 1729: —Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
LINE 1730: —You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
LINE 1731: —Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
LINE 1732: says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
LINE 1733: shores.
LINE 1734: —Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my
LINE 1735: prayer.
LINE 1736: —Amen, says the citizen.
LINE 1737: —And I'm sure He will, says Joe.
LINE 1738: And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
LINE 1739: acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
LINE 1740: subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors
LINE 1741: and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,
LINE 1742: Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and
LINE 1743: Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,
LINE 1744: Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter
LINE 1745: Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet
LINE 1746: led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and
LINE 1747: friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,
LINE 1748: minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of
LINE 1749: Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks
LINE 1750: of S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the
LINE 1751: christian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice.
LINE 1752: And after came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr
LINE 1753: and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and
LINE 1754: S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites
LINE 1755: and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S.
LINE 1756: Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent
LINE 1757: de Paul and S. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and
LINE 1758: S. Joseph and S. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard
LINE 1759: and S. Terence and S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and
LINE 1760: S. Eponymous and S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous
LINE 1761: and S. Synonymous and S. Laurence O'Toole and S. James of Dingle and
LINE 1762: Compostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S.
LINE 1763: Colman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S.
LINE 1764: Fachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and
LINE 1765: S. Fiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of
LINE 1766: Brittany and S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of
LINE 1767: holy youth S. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John
LINE 1768: Berchmans and the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S.
LINE 1769: Bride and S. Kieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam
LINE 1770: and S. Finbarr and S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus
LINE 1771: and Brother Louis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo
LINE 1772: and S. Martha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid
LINE 1773: and S. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and
LINE 1774: the Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S.
LINE 1775: Scholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came
LINE 1776: with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords
LINE 1777: and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of
LINE 1778: their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,
LINE 1779: trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,
LINE 1780: dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,

LINE 1782: forceps, stags' horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a
LINE 1783: dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way
LINE 1784: by Nelson's Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little
LINE 1785: Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which
LINE 1786: beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual
LINE 1787: _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as
LINE 1788: casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes,
LINE 1789: healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had
LINE 1790: been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and
LINE 1791: prophesying. And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the
LINE 1792: reverend Father O'Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the
LINE 1793: good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard
LINE 1794: Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale
LINE 1795: grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine
LINE 1796: and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the
LINE 1797: house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults
LINE 1798: and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and
LINE 1799: the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the
LINE 1800: lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that
LINE 1801: house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and
LINE 1802: make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering he
LINE 1803: blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed
LINE 1804: answered his prayers.
LINE 1805: —_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._
LINE 1806: —_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._
LINE 1807: —_Dominus vobiscum._
LINE 1808: —_Et cum spiritu tuo._
LINE 1809: And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he
LINE 1810: prayed and they all with him prayed:
LINE 1811: —_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde
LINE 1812: super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
LINE 1813: voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem
LINE 1814: sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore
LINE 1815: percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._
LINE 1816: —And so say all of us, says Jack.
LINE 1817: —Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.
LINE 1818: —Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.
LINE 1819: I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike
LINE 1820: when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a
LINE 1821: hurry.
LINE 1822: —I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope
LINE 1823: I'm not...
LINE 1824: —No, says Martin, we're ready.
LINE 1825: Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.
LINE 1826: Mean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There's
LINE 1827: a jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to
LINE 1828: five.
LINE 1829: —Don't tell anyone, says the citizen.
LINE 1830: —Beg your pardon, says he.
LINE 1831: —Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
LINE 1832: —Don't tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It's a
LINE 1833: secret.
LINE 1834: And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.
LINE 1835: —Bye bye all, says Martin.
LINE 1836: And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
LINE 1837: whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be
LINE 1838: all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.
LINE 1839: —Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.
LINE 1840: The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop
LINE 1841: the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off
LINE 1842: forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely
LINE 1843: nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the
LINE 1844: sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the
LINE 1845: cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
LINE 1846: equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds
LINE 1847: them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas
LINE 1848: they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so
LINE 1849: did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.
LINE 1850: And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark
LINE 1851: clave the waves.
LINE 1852: But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
LINE 1853: citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
LINE 1854: dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
LINE 1855: candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little
LINE 1856: Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.
LINE 1857: —Let me alone, says he.
LINE 1858: And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls
LINE 1859: out of him:
LINE 1860: —Three cheers for Israel!
LINE 1861: Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ' sake
LINE 1862: and don't be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there's
LINE 1863: always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
LINE 1864: bloody nothing. Gob, it'd turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
LINE 1865: would.
LINE 1866: And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
LINE 1867: Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and
LINE 1868: Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews
LINE 1869: and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him
LINE 1870: to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a
LINE 1871: patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew,
LINE 1872: jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her:
LINE 1873: —Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
LINE 1874: And says he:
LINE 1875: —Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And
LINE 1876: the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.
LINE 1877: —He had no father, says Martin. That'll do now. Drive ahead.
LINE 1878: —Whose God? says the citizen.
LINE 1879: —Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a
LINE 1880: jew like me.
LINE 1881: Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.
LINE 1882: —By Jesus, says he, I'll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
LINE 1883: name. By Jesus, I'll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.
LINE 1884: —Stop! Stop! says Joe.
LINE 1885: A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
LINE 1886: the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
LINE 1887: farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
LINE 1888: Thom's, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for
LINE 1889: the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of
LINE 1890: Murmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was
LINE 1891: characterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll
LINE 1892: of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
LINE 1893: the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
LINE 1894: community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,
LINE 1895: tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work
LINE 1896: which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.
LINE 1897: The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of
LINE 1898: those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of
LINE 1899: Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,
LINE 1900: followed immediately by _Rakóczsy's March_. Tarbarrels and bonfires
LINE 1901: were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the
LINE 1902: Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains
LINE 1903: of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the
LINE 1904: Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of
LINE 1905: M'Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid
LINE 1906: cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a
LINE 1907: big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,
LINE 1908: the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final
LINE 1909: floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were
LINE 1910: present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,
LINE 1911: escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and
LINE 1912: Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical
LINE 1913: power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.
LINE 1914: _Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not
LINE 1915: forgotten.
LINE 1916: Gob, the devil wouldn't stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
LINE 1917: anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
LINE 1918: shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen's
LINE 1919: royal theatre:
LINE 1920: —Where is he till I murder him?
LINE 1921: And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.
LINE 1922: —Bloody wars, says I, I'll be in for the last gospel.
LINE 1923: But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag's head round the other
LINE 1924: way and off with him.
LINE 1925: —Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
LINE 1926: Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the
LINE 1927: sun was in his eyes or he'd have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent
LINE 1928: it into the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old
LINE 1929: mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting
LINE 1930: and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.
LINE 1931: The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
LINE 1932: observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the
LINE 1933: fifth grade of Mercalli's scale, and there is no record extant of a
LINE 1934: similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,
LINE 1935: the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to
LINE 1936: have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn's Quay
LINE 1937: ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres,
LINE 1938: two roods and one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in
LINE 1939: the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble
LINE 1940: edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal
LINE 1941: debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it
LINE 1942: is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the
LINE 1943: reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were
LINE 1944: accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic
LINE 1945: character. An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the
LINE 1946: much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a
LINE 1947: silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat
LINE 1948: of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of
LINE 1949: quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been
LINE 1950: discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island
LINE 1951: respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant's
LINE 1952: causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in
LINE 1953: the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other
LINE 1954: eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of
LINE 1955: enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying
LINE 1956: velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west. Messages of
LINE 1957: condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the
LINE 1958: different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously
LINE 1959: pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be
LINE 1960: celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral
LINE 1961: church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority
LINE 1962: of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who
LINE 1963: have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The work of
LINE 1964: salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to
LINE 1965: Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.
LINE 1966: and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men and
LINE 1967: officers of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry under the general
LINE 1968: supervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir
LINE 1969: Hercules Hannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C.,
LINE 1970: K. C. B., M. P., J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I.
LINE 1971: A., B. L., Mus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P.
LINE 1972: I. and F. R. C. S. I.
LINE 1973: You never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that
LINE 1974: lottery ticket on the side of his poll he'd remember the gold cup, he
LINE 1975: would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and
LINE 1976: battery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by
LINE 1977: furious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And
LINE 1978: he let a volley of oaths after him.
LINE 1979: —Did I kill him, says he, or what?
LINE 1980: And he shouting to the bloody dog:
LINE 1981: —After him, Garry! After him, boy!
LINE 1982: And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old
LINE 1983: sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his
LINE 1984: lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.
LINE 1985: Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise
LINE 1986: you.
LINE 1987: When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld
LINE 1988: the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in
LINE 1989: the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having
LINE 1990: raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they
LINE 1991: durst not look upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling:
LINE 1992: _Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And
LINE 1993: they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels
LINE 1994: ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees
LINE 1995: over Donohoe's in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.
