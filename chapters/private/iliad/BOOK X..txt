LINE 1: ARGUMENT.
LINE 2: THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.
LINE 3: Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of
LINE 4: Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that
LINE 5: night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving
LINE 6: all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses,
LINE 7: and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call
LINE 8: a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp,
LINE 9: to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed
LINE 10: undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for
LINE 11: his companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had
LINE 12: sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are
LINE 13: informed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and
LINE 14: particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They
LINE 15: pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and
LINE 16: seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in
LINE 17: triumph to the camp.
LINE 18: The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.
LINE 19: All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,
LINE 20: And lost in sleep the labours of the day:
LINE 21: All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,[215]
LINE 22: His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.
LINE 23: As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power
LINE 24: Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,
LINE 25: Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,
LINE 26: Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;
LINE 27: By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,
LINE 28: And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:
LINE 29: So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,
LINE 30: Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.
LINE 31: Now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys
LINE 32: From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;
LINE 33: Hears in the passing wind their music blow,
LINE 34: And marks distinct the voices of the foe.
LINE 35: Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,
LINE 36: Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.
LINE 37: He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,
LINE 38: And sues to him that ever lives above:
LINE 39: Inly he groans; while glory and despair
LINE 40: Divide his heart, and wage a double war.
LINE 41: A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;
LINE 42: To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,
LINE 43: With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate
LINE 44: What yet remains to save the afflicted state.
LINE 45: He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,
LINE 46: Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;
LINE 47: A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;
LINE 48: His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.
LINE 49: Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,
LINE 50: Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,
LINE 51: Laments for Greece, that in his cause before
LINE 52: So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.
LINE 53: A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread:
LINE 54: A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:
LINE 55: Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went
LINE 56: To wake Atrides in the royal tent.
LINE 57: Already waked, Atrides he descried,
LINE 58: His armour buckling at his vessel's side.
LINE 59: Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:
LINE 60: "Why puts my brother his bright armour on?
LINE 61: Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,
LINE 62: To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?
LINE 63: But say, what hero shall sustain that task?
LINE 64: Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;
LINE 65: Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,
LINE 66: And midst a hostile camp explore the foe."
LINE 67: To whom the king: "In such distress we stand,
LINE 68: No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;
LINE 69: Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,
LINE 70: But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.
LINE 71: For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,
LINE 72: And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.
LINE 73: What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,
LINE 74: In one great day, by one great arm achieved,
LINE 75: Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,
LINE 76: And we beheld, the last revolving sun?
LINE 77: What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!
LINE 78: Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;
LINE 79: Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,
LINE 80: And curse the battle where their fathers fell.
LINE 81: "Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,
LINE 82: There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;
LINE 83: Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;
LINE 84: To keep the guards on duty be his care,
LINE 85: (For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,
LINE 86: Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.")
LINE 87: To whom the Spartan: "These thy orders borne,
LINE 88: Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?"
LINE 89: "There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)
LINE 90: Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,
LINE 91: The paths so many, and the camp so wide.
LINE 92: Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,
LINE 93: Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.
LINE 94: Forget we now our state and lofty birth;
LINE 95: Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.
LINE 96: To labour is the lot of man below;
LINE 97: And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe."
LINE 98: This said, each parted to his several cares:
LINE 99: The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;
LINE 100: The sage protector of the Greeks he found
LINE 101: Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around;
LINE 102: The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,
LINE 103: The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;
LINE 104: The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,
LINE 105: That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.
LINE 106: Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,
LINE 107: The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:
LINE 108: "What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,
LINE 109: While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;
LINE 110: Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?
LINE 111: Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell."
LINE 112: "O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)
LINE 113: Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!
LINE 114: Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,
LINE 115: The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,
LINE 116: Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,
LINE 117: And woes, that only with his life shall end!
LINE 118: Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,
LINE 119: And scarce my heart support its load of pain.
LINE 120: No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,
LINE 121: Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,
LINE 122: With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;
LINE 123: And all my people's miseries are mine.
LINE 124: If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,
LINE 125: (Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)
LINE 126: Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;
LINE 127: Now let us jointly to the trench descend,
LINE 128: At every gate the fainting guard excite,
LINE 129: Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;
LINE 130: Else may the sudden foe our works invade,
LINE 131: So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade."
LINE 132: To him thus Nestor: "Trust the powers above,
LINE 133: Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:
LINE 134: How ill agree the views of vain mankind,
LINE 135: And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!
LINE 136: Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain
LINE 137: That great Achilles rise and rage again,
LINE 138: What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!
LINE 139: Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;
LINE 140: The care is next our other chiefs to raise:
LINE 141: Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;
LINE 142: Meges for strength, Oïleus famed for speed.
LINE 143: Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,
LINE 144: To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,
LINE 145: Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.[216]
LINE 146: To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;
LINE 147: Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,
LINE 148: Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share
LINE 149: With his great brother in his martial care:
LINE 150: Him it behoved to every chief to sue,
LINE 151: Preventing every part perform'd by you;
LINE 152: For strong necessity our toils demands,
LINE 153: Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands."
LINE 154: To whom the king: "With reverence we allow
LINE 155: Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:
LINE 156: My generous brother is of gentle kind,
LINE 157: He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;
LINE 158: Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,
LINE 159: Content to follow when we lead the way:
LINE 160: But now, our ills industrious to prevent,
LINE 161: Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.
LINE 162: The chiefs you named, already at his call,
LINE 163: Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;
LINE 164: Assembling there, between the trench and gates,
LINE 165: Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits."
LINE 166: "Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,
LINE 167: For great examples justify command."
LINE 168: With that, the venerable warrior rose;
LINE 169: The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;
LINE 170: His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,
LINE 171: Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.
LINE 172: Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste
LINE 173: His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.
LINE 174: The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,
LINE 175: Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.
LINE 176: Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,
LINE 177: Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.
LINE 178: "What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,
LINE 179: Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?"
LINE 180: "O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)
LINE 181: Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:
LINE 182: Whatever means of safety can be sought,
LINE 183: Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,
LINE 184: Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;
LINE 185: All, all depend on this important night!"
LINE 186: He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;
LINE 187: Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.
LINE 188: Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,
LINE 189: All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:
LINE 190: Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,
LINE 191: His head reclining on his bossy shield.
LINE 192: A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,
LINE 193: Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.
LINE 194: A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;
LINE 195: A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.
LINE 196: Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes
LINE 197: The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:
LINE 198: "Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong
LINE 199: Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.
LINE 200: But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe
LINE 201: Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?"
LINE 202: At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;
LINE 203: The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:
LINE 204: "Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,
LINE 205: Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,
LINE 206: Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;
LINE 207: Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake."
LINE 208: "My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;
LINE 209: These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;
LINE 210: Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire
LINE 211: To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:
LINE 212: But now the last despair surrounds our host;
LINE 213: No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;
LINE 214: Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,
LINE 215: Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:
LINE 216: Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,
LINE 217: Employ thy youth as I employ my age;
LINE 218: Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;
LINE 219: He serves me most, who serves his country best."
LINE 220: This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung
LINE 221: A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;
LINE 222: Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.
LINE 223: Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,
LINE 224: The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.
LINE 225: And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;
LINE 226: A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:
LINE 227: The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,
LINE 228: And, couching close, repel invading sleep.
LINE 229: So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,
LINE 230: With toil protected from the prowling train;
LINE 231: When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,
LINE 232: Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:
LINE 233: Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;
LINE 234: Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear
LINE 235: Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,
LINE 236: Watch every side, and turn to every sound.
LINE 237: Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,
LINE 238: Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:
LINE 239: Each step of passing feet increased the affright;
LINE 240: And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.
LINE 241: Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,
LINE 242: And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.
LINE 243: "'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;
LINE 244: Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.
LINE 245: Watch thus, and Greece shall live." The hero said;
LINE 246: Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.
LINE 247: His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind
LINE 248: (For these the princes to their council join'd).
LINE 249: The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around
LINE 250: In silent state the consistory crown'd.
LINE 251: A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,
LINE 252: The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;
LINE 253: When night descending, from his vengeful hand
LINE 254: Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:
LINE 255: (The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,
LINE 256: And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)
LINE 257: There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,
LINE 258: The council opening, in these words begun:
LINE 259: "Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,
LINE 260: His life to hazard, and his country save?
LINE 261: Lives there a man, who singly dares to go
LINE 262: To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?
LINE 263: Or favour'd by the night approach so near,
LINE 264: Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?
LINE 265: If to besiege our navies they prepare,
LINE 266: Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?
LINE 267: This could he learn, and to our peers recite,
LINE 268: And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;
LINE 269: What fame were his through all succeeding days,
LINE 270: While Phœbus shines, or men have tongues to praise!
LINE 271: What gifts his grateful country would bestow!
LINE 272: What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?
LINE 273: A sable ewe each leader should provide,
LINE 274: With each a sable lambkin by her side;
LINE 275: At every rite his share should be increased,
LINE 276: And his the foremost honours of the feast."
LINE 277: Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,
LINE 278: Tydides spoke—"The man you seek is here.
LINE 279: Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,
LINE 280: Some god within commands, and I obey.
LINE 281: But let some other chosen warrior join,
LINE 282: To raise my hopes, and second my design.
LINE 283: By mutual confidence and mutual aid,
LINE 284: Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;
LINE 285: The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,
LINE 286: And one brave hero fans another's fire."
LINE 287: Contending leaders at the word arose;
LINE 288: Each generous breast with emulation glows;
LINE 289: So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,
LINE 290: Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;
LINE 291: The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,
LINE 292: And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.
LINE 293: Then thus the king of men the contest ends:
LINE 294: "Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,
LINE 295: Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join
LINE 296: In this great enterprise, is only thine.
LINE 297: Just be thy choice, without affection made;
LINE 298: To birth, or office, no respect be paid;
LINE 299: Let worth determine here." The monarch spake,
LINE 300: And inly trembled for his brother's sake.
LINE 301: "Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)
LINE 302: My choice declares the impulse of my mind.
LINE 303: How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands
LINE 304: To lend his counsels and assist our hands?
LINE 305: A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;
LINE 306: So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:
LINE 307: Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;
LINE 308: Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire."
LINE 309: "It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,
LINE 310: (Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:
LINE 311: Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,
LINE 312: Are lost on hearers that our merits know.
LINE 313: But let us haste—Night rolls the hours away,
LINE 314: The reddening orient shows the coming day,
LINE 315: The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,
LINE 316: And of night's empire but a third remains."
LINE 317: Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,
LINE 318: In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.
LINE 319: A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,
LINE 320: And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:
LINE 321: Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,
LINE 322: Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:
LINE 323: (Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)
LINE 324: No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.
LINE 325: Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,
LINE 326: A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:
LINE 327: A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,
LINE 328: (Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;
LINE 329: Soft wool within; without, in order spread,[217]
LINE 330: A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.
LINE 331: This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,
LINE 332: Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,
LINE 333: And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize
LINE 334: Molus received, the pledge of social ties;
LINE 335: The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,
LINE 336: And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.
LINE 337: Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,
LINE 338: And dark through paths oblique their progress take.
LINE 339: Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,
LINE 340: A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:
LINE 341: This, though surrounding shades obscured their view,
LINE 342: By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.
LINE 343: As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,
LINE 344: Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:
LINE 345: "O daughter of that god whose arm can wield
LINE 346: The avenging bolt, and shake the saber shield!
LINE 347: O thou! for ever present in my way,
LINE 348: Who all my motions, all my toils survey!
LINE 349: Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,
LINE 350: Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,
LINE 351: And let some deed this signal night adorn,
LINE 352: To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn."
LINE 353: Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:
LINE 354: "Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.
LINE 355: Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,
LINE 356: As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.
LINE 357: When on Æsopus' banks the banded powers
LINE 358: Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,
LINE 359: Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,
LINE 360: He went a legate, but return'd a foe:
LINE 361: Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,
LINE 362: He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.
LINE 363: So now be present, O celestial maid!
LINE 364: So still continue to the race thine aid!
LINE 365: A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,
LINE 366: Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,
LINE 367: With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,
LINE 368: Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns."
LINE 369: The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies
LINE 370: Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.
LINE 371: Now, like two lions panting for the prey,
LINE 372: With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,
LINE 373: Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,
LINE 374: Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.
LINE 375: Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,
LINE 376: On high designs the wakeful hours employ;
LINE 377: The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;
LINE 378: Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:
LINE 379: "What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,
LINE 380: Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?
LINE 381: Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,
LINE 382: What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?
LINE 383: If now subdued they meditate their flight,
LINE 384: And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?
LINE 385: His be the chariot that shall please him most,
LINE 386: Of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host;
LINE 387: His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,
LINE 388: And his the glory to have served so well."
LINE 389: A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,
LINE 390: Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,
LINE 391: (Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)
LINE 392: Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;
LINE 393: Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,
LINE 394: But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.
LINE 395: "Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet
LINE 396: This high achievement, and explore the fleet:
LINE 397: But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,
LINE 398: And swear to grant me the demanded prize;
LINE 399: The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,
LINE 400: That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.
LINE 401: Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,
LINE 402: Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,
LINE 403: Even to the royal tent pursue my way,
LINE 404: And all their counsels, all their aims betray."
LINE 405: The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,
LINE 406: Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:
LINE 407: "Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!
LINE 408: Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:
LINE 409: By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,
LINE 410: And him alone the immortal steeds adorn."
LINE 411: Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,
LINE 412: But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:
LINE 413: Across his back the bended bow he flung,
LINE 414: A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,
LINE 415: A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,
LINE 416: And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.
LINE 417: Then (never to return) he sought the shore,
LINE 418: And trod the path his feet must tread no more.
LINE 419: Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,
LINE 420: (Still bending forward as he coursed along,)
LINE 421: When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread
LINE 422: Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;
LINE 423: "O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,
LINE 424: Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;
LINE 425: Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;
LINE 426: Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.
LINE 427: Yet let him pass, and win a little space;
LINE 428: Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.
LINE 429: But if too swift of foot he flies before,
LINE 430: Confine his course along the fleet and shore,
LINE 431: Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,
LINE 432: And intercept his hoped return to Troy."
LINE 433: With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,
LINE 434: (As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:
LINE 435: Along the path the spy unwary flew;
LINE 436: Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.
LINE 437: So distant they, and such the space between,
LINE 438: As when two teams of mules divide the green,
LINE 439: (To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)
LINE 440: When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.
LINE 441: Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;
LINE 442: Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,
LINE 443: Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,
LINE 444: No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.
LINE 445: As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;
LINE 446: Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;
LINE 447: Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,
LINE 448: And from the herd still turn the flying prey:
LINE 449: So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;
LINE 450: So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.
LINE 451: Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,
LINE 452: And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;
LINE 453: When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought
LINE 454: (Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,
LINE 455: Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,
LINE 456: And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.
LINE 457: Then thus aloud: "Whoe'er thou art, remain;
LINE 458: This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain."
LINE 459: He said, and high in air the weapon cast,
LINE 460: Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;
LINE 461: Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood
LINE 462: The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;
LINE 463: A sudden palsy seized his turning head;
LINE 464: His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;
LINE 465: The panting warriors seize him as he stands,
LINE 466: And with unmanly tears his life demands.
LINE 467: "O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,
LINE 468: Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:
LINE 469: Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,
LINE 470: And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold."
LINE 471: To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:
LINE 472: "Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.
LINE 473: What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,
LINE 474: To roam the silent fields in dead of night?
LINE 475: Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,
LINE 476: By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?
LINE 477: Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,
LINE 478: Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?"
LINE 479: Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:
LINE 480: (Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)
LINE 481: "Hither I came, by Hector's words deceived;
LINE 482: Much did he promise, rashly I believed:
LINE 483: No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,
LINE 484: And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,
LINE 485: Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;
LINE 486: To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:
LINE 487: If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,
LINE 488: And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night."
LINE 489: "Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,
LINE 490: (Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)
LINE 491: Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,
LINE 492: And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;
LINE 493: Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,
LINE 494: Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.
LINE 495: But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!
LINE 496: Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night?
LINE 497: Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep
LINE 498: Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:
LINE 499: Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;
LINE 500: Or here to combat, from their city far,
LINE 501: Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?"
LINE 502: Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:
LINE 503: "What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.
LINE 504: Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,
LINE 505: A council holds at Ilus' monument.
LINE 506: No certain guards the nightly watch partake;
LINE 507: Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:
LINE 508: Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;
LINE 509: Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,
LINE 510: Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,
LINE 511: Discharge their souls of half the fears of war."
LINE 512: "Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,
LINE 513: (Inquired the chief,) or scattered o'er the plain?"
LINE 514: To whom the spy: "Their powers they thus dispose
LINE 515: The Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,
LINE 516: The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,
LINE 517: And Leleges, encamp along the coast.
LINE 518: Not distant far, lie higher on the land
LINE 519: The Lycian, Mysian, and Mæonian band,
LINE 520: And Phrygia's horse, by Thymbras' ancient wall;
LINE 521: The Thracians utmost, and apart from all.
LINE 522: These Troy but lately to her succour won,
LINE 523: Led on by Rhesus, great Eioneus' son:
LINE 524: I saw his coursers in proud triumph go,
LINE 525: Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;
LINE 526: Rich silver plates his shining car infold;
LINE 527: His solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;
LINE 528: No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,
LINE 529: Celestial panoply, to grace a god!
LINE 530: Let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,
LINE 531: Or leave me here, a captive's fate to mourn,
LINE 532: In cruel chains, till your return reveal
LINE 533: The truth or falsehood of the news I tell."
LINE 534: To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:
LINE 535: "Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:
LINE 536: Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife
LINE 537: To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?
LINE 538: Or that again our camps thou may'st explore?
LINE 539: No—once a traitor, thou betray'st no more."
LINE 540: Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared
LINE 541: With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,
LINE 542: Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,
LINE 543: Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;
LINE 544: One instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell,
LINE 545: The head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell.
LINE 546: The furry helmet from his brow they tear,
LINE 547: The wolf's grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;
LINE 548: These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,
LINE 549: To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:
LINE 550: "Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,
LINE 551: And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;
LINE 552: Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;
LINE 553: O speed our labours, and direct our ways!"
LINE 554: This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,
LINE 555: High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;
LINE 556: Then heap'd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,
LINE 557: To guide their footsteps to the place again.
LINE 558: Through the still night they cross the devious fields,
LINE 559: Slippery with blood, o'er arms and heaps of shields,
LINE 560: Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,
LINE 561: And eased in sleep the labours of the day.
LINE 562: Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:
LINE 563: The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.
LINE 564: Their arms in order on the ground reclined,
LINE 565: Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:
LINE 566: Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound,
LINE 567: And the white steeds behind his chariot bound.
LINE 568: The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,
LINE 569: And points to Diomed the tempting prize.
LINE 570: "The man, the coursers, and the car behold!
LINE 571: Described by Dolon, with the arms of gold.
LINE 572: Now, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,
LINE 573: Approach the chariot, and the steeds untie;
LINE 574: Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,
LINE 575: Urge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds."
LINE 576: Pallas (this said) her hero's bosom warms,
LINE 577: Breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;
LINE 578: Where'er he pass'd, a purple stream pursued
LINE 579: His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,
LINE 580: Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,
LINE 581: And a low groan remurmur'd through the shore.
LINE 582: So the grim lion, from his nightly den,
LINE 583: O'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,
LINE 584: On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,
LINE 585: He falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;
LINE 586: Nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand,
LINE 587: Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.
LINE 588: Ulysses following, as his partner slew,
LINE 589: Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew;
LINE 590: The milk-white coursers studious to convey
LINE 591: Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:
LINE 592: Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,
LINE 593: Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.
LINE 594: Now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found;
LINE 595: Tydides' falchion fix'd him to the ground.
LINE 596: Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent,
LINE 597: A warlike form appear'd before his tent,
LINE 598: Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:
LINE 599: So dream'd the monarch, and awaked no more.[218]
LINE 600: Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,
LINE 601: And leads them, fasten'd by the silver reins;
LINE 602: These, with his bow unbent, he lash'd along;
LINE 603: (The scourge forgot, on Rhesus' chariot hung;)
LINE 604: Then gave his friend the signal to retire;
LINE 605: But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;
LINE 606: Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade
LINE 607: To send more heroes to the infernal shade,
LINE 608: Drag off the car where Rhesus' armour lay,
LINE 609: Or heave with manly force, and lift away.
LINE 610: While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,
LINE 611: Pallas appears, and thus her chief commands:
LINE 612: "Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,
LINE 613: Regard thy safety, and depart in peace;
LINE 614: Haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,
LINE 615: Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy."
LINE 616: The voice divine confess'd the martial maid;
LINE 617: In haste he mounted, and her word obey'd;
LINE 618: The coursers fly before Ulysses' bow,
LINE 619: Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.
LINE 620: Not unobserved they pass'd: the god of light
LINE 621: Had watch'd his Troy, and mark'd Minerva's flight,
LINE 622: Saw Tydeus' son with heavenly succour bless'd,
LINE 623: And vengeful anger fill'd his sacred breast.
LINE 624: Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power,
LINE 625: And wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;
LINE 626: (On Rhesus' side accustom'd to attend,
LINE 627: A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)
LINE 628: He rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood,
LINE 629: An empty space where late the coursers stood,
LINE 630: The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;
LINE 631: For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:
LINE 632: Now while on Rhesus' name he calls in vain,
LINE 633: The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain;
LINE 634: On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,
LINE 635: And wondering view the slaughters of the night.
LINE 636: Meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade
LINE 637: Where late the spoils of Hector's spy were laid,
LINE 638: Ulysses stopp'd; to him Tydides bore
LINE 639: The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon's gore:
LINE 640: Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet
LINE 641: The coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.
LINE 642: [Illustration: ] DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS
LINE 643: Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,
LINE 644: Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:
LINE 645: "Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,
LINE 646: Thickening this way, and gathering on my ear;
LINE 647: Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed
LINE 648: (So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)
LINE 649: The great Tydides and Ulysses bear,
LINE 650: Return'd triumphant with this prize of war.
LINE 651: Yet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)
LINE 652: The chiefs outnumber'd by the Trojan train;
LINE 653: Perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;
LINE 654: Or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more."
LINE 655: Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,
LINE 656: And spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:
LINE 657: With words of friendship and extended hands
LINE 658: They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:
LINE 659: "Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,
LINE 660: Thou living glory of the Grecian name!
LINE 661: Say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow'd,
LINE 662: The spoil of foes, or present of a god?
LINE 663: Not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,
LINE 664: That draw the burning chariot of the day.
LINE 665: Old as I am, to age I scorn to yield,
LINE 666: And daily mingle in the martial field;
LINE 667: But sure till now no coursers struck my sight
LINE 668: Like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.
LINE 669: Some god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,
LINE 670: Bless'd as ye are, and favourites of the skies;
LINE 671: The care of him who bids the thunder roar,
LINE 672: And her, whose fury bathes the world with gore."
LINE 673: "Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin'd,)
LINE 674: The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.
LINE 675: Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,
LINE 676: Whose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;
LINE 677: Sleeping he died, with all his guards around,
LINE 678: And twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.
LINE 679: These other spoils from conquer'd Dolon came,
LINE 680: A wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;
LINE 681: By Hector sent our forces to explore,
LINE 682: He now lies headless on the sandy shore."
LINE 683: Then o'er the trench the bounding coursers flew;
LINE 684: The joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.
LINE 685: Straight to Tydides' high pavilion borne,
LINE 686: The matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:
LINE 687: The neighing coursers their new fellows greet,
LINE 688: And the full racks are heap'd with generous wheat.
LINE 689: But Dolon's armour, to his ships convey'd,
LINE 690: High on the painted stern Ulysses laid,
LINE 691: A trophy destin'd to the blue-eyed maid.
LINE 692: Now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain
LINE 693: They cleanse their bodies in the neighb'ring main:
LINE 694: Then in the polished bath, refresh'd from toil,
LINE 695: Their joints they supple with dissolving oil,
LINE 696: In due repast indulge the genial hour,
LINE 697: And first to Pallas the libations pour:
LINE 698: They sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,
LINE 699: And the crown'd goblet foams with floods of wine.
