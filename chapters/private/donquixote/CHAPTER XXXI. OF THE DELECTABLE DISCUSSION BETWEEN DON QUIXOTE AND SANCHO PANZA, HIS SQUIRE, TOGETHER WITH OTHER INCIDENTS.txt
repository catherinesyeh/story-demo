LINE 3: "All that is not unsatisfactory to me," said Don Quixote. "Go on; thou
LINE 4: didst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thou
LINE 5: didst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold
LINE 6: thread for this her enslaved knight."
LINE 7: "I did not," said Sancho, "but I found her winnowing two bushels of
LINE 8: wheat in the yard of her house."
LINE 9: "Then depend upon it," said Don Quixote, "the grains of that wheat were
LINE 10: pearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it
LINE 11: white wheat or brown?"
LINE 12: "It was neither, but red," said Sancho.
LINE 13: "Then I promise thee," said Don Quixote, "that, winnowed by her hands,
LINE 14: beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when
LINE 15: thou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her
LINE 16: head? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?"
LINE 17: "When I went to give it to her," replied Sancho, "she was hard at it
LINE 18: swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and
LINE 19: she said to me, 'Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I
LINE 20: cannot read it until I have done sifting all this."
LINE 21: "Discreet lady!" said Don Quixote; "that was in order to read it at her
LINE 22: leisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her
LINE 23: occupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about
LINE 24: me, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let
LINE 25: not an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle."
LINE 26: "She asked me nothing," said Sancho; "but I told her how your worship
LINE 27: was left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in
LINE 28: among these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating
LINE 29: bread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your
LINE 30: fortune."
LINE 31: "In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong," said Don Quixote;
LINE 32: "for rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life
LINE 33: for having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as
LINE 34: Dulcinea del Toboso."
LINE 35: "And so lofty she is," said Sancho, "that she overtops me by more than
LINE 36: a hand's-breadth."
LINE 37: "What! Sancho," said Don Quixote, "didst thou measure with her?"
LINE 38: "I measured in this way," said Sancho; "going to help her to put a sack
LINE 39: of wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could
LINE 40: see she stood more than a good palm over me."
LINE 41: "Well!" said Don Quixote, "and doth she not of a truth accompany and
LINE 42: adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one
LINE 43: thing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst
LINE 44: thou not perceive a Sabæan odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not
LINE 45: what, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an
LINE 46: exhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?"
LINE 47: "All I can say is," said Sancho, "that I did perceive a little odour,
LINE 48: something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with
LINE 49: hard work."
LINE 50: "It could not be that," said Don Quixote, "but thou must have been
LINE 51: suffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know
LINE 52: well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of
LINE 53: the field, that dissolved amber."
LINE 54: "Maybe so," replied Sancho; "there often comes from myself that same
LINE 55: odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;
LINE 56: but that's no wonder, for one devil is like another."
LINE 57: "Well then," continued Don Quixote, "now she has done sifting the corn
LINE 58: and sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?"
LINE 59: "As for the letter," said Sancho, "she did not read it, for she said
LINE 60: she could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into
LINE 61: small pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest
LINE 62: her secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had
LINE 63: told her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the
LINE 64: extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to
LINE 65: make an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed
LINE 66: your hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write
LINE 67: to you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of
LINE 68: this present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with
LINE 69: carrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless
LINE 70: something else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great
LINE 71: desire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how
LINE 72: your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked
LINE 73: her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he
LINE 74: had, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley
LINE 75: slaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet."
LINE 76: "So far all goes well," said Don Quixote; "but tell me what jewel was
LINE 77: it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of
LINE 78: me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant
LINE 79: to give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their
LINE 80: ladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich
LINE 81: jewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message."
LINE 82: "That is very likely," said Sancho, "and a good custom it was, to my
LINE 83: mind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to
LINE 84: be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that
LINE 85: was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I
LINE 86: took leave of her; and more by token it was sheep's-milk cheese."
LINE 87: "She is generous in the extreme," said Don Quixote, "and if she did not
LINE 88: give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had
LINE 89: not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter;
LINE 90: I shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what
LINE 91: amazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through
LINE 92: the air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to
LINE 93: El Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here
LINE 94: to there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who
LINE 95: is my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is
LINE 96: and must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that
LINE 97: this same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy
LINE 98: knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant
LINE 99: sleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it
LINE 100: happened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away
LINE 101: from the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,
LINE 102: knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril,
LINE 103: as they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the
LINE 104: mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another
LINE 105: knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death;
LINE 106: but when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on a
LINE 107: cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just
LINE 108: before had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him
LINE 109: from death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping
LINE 110: very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will
LINE 111: have been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the
LINE 112: craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant
LINE 113: knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that
LINE 114: thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such
LINE 115: a short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have
LINE 116: carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it."
LINE 117: "That must have been it," said Sancho, "for indeed Rocinante went like
LINE 118: a gipsy's ass with quicksilver in his ears."
LINE 119: "Quicksilver!" said Don Quixote, "aye and what is more, a legion of
LINE 120: devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being
LINE 121: weary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what
LINE 122: thinkest thou I ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her?
LINE 123: For though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that
LINE 124: I am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that
LINE 125: accompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for
LINE 126: my word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to
LINE 127: see my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and
LINE 128: the glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what I
LINE 129: think I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the
LINE 130: place where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head,
LINE 131: and establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith I
LINE 132: shall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom I
LINE 133: shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay,
LINE 134: for she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame;
LINE 135: for all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life,
LINE 136: comes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers."
LINE 137: "Ah! what a sad state your worship's brains are in!" said Sancho. "Tell
LINE 138: me, señor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let
LINE 139: slip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a
LINE 140: portion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than
LINE 141: twenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things
LINE 142: necessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and
LINE 143: Castile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you
LINE 144: have said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the
LINE 145: first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate
LINE 146: who will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give
LINE 147: advice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in
LINE 148: the hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good
LINE 149: to his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not
LINE 150: come to him."
LINE 151: "Look here, Sancho," said Don Quixote. "If thou art advising me to
LINE 152: marry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become
LINE 153: king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have
LINE 154: promised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy
LINE 155: desires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a
LINE 156: stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry,
LINE 157: they shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon
LINE 158: whomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou
LINE 159: have me bestow it but upon thee?"
LINE 160: "That is plain speaking," said Sancho; "but let your worship take care
LINE 161: to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don't like the life, I may
LINE 162: be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;
LINE 163: don't mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this
LINE 164: giant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it
LINE 165: will be one of great honour and great profit."
LINE 166: "I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "and I
LINE 167: will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to
LINE 168: see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to
LINE 169: those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for
LINE 170: as Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be
LINE 171: known it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them."
LINE 172: "Well then, if that be so," said Sancho, "how is it that your worship
LINE 173: makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves
LINE 174: before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name
LINE 175: to it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must
LINE 176: perforce kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit
LINE 177: themselves to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?"
LINE 178: "O, how silly and simple thou art!" said Don Quixote; "seest thou not,
LINE 179: Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know
LINE 180: that according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour
LINE 181: to a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts
LINE 182: never go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other
LINE 183: reward for their great and true devotion than that she should be
LINE 184: willing to accept them as her knights."
LINE 185: "It is with that kind of love," said Sancho, "I have heard preachers
LINE 186: say we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved
LINE 187: by the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I
LINE 188: would rather love and serve him for what he could do."
LINE 189: "The devil take thee for a clown!" said Don Quixote, "and what shrewd
LINE 190: things thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied."
LINE 191: "In faith, then, I cannot even read."
LINE 192: Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted
LINE 193: to halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew
LINE 194: up, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time
LINE 195: weary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him
LINE 196: tripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El
LINE 197: Toboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on
LINE 198: the clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though
LINE 199: they were not very good, they were far better than those he put off.
LINE 200: They dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the
LINE 201: curate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not
LINE 202: very well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.
LINE 203: While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing
LINE 204: on his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next
LINE 205: moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to
LINE 206: weep freely, saying, "O, señor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I
LINE 207: am that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I
LINE 208: was tied."
LINE 209: Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those
LINE 210: present and said: "That your worships may see how important it is to
LINE 211: have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by
LINE 212: tyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days
LINE 213: ago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of
LINE 214: a person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my
LINE 215: bounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me
LINE 216: to proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before
LINE 217: you, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit
LINE 218: me to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to
LINE 219: an oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found
LINE 220: to be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his
LINE 221: mare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a
LINE 222: flagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was
LINE 223: his servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from
LINE 224: dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, 'Señor, he flogs me
LINE 225: only because I ask for my wages.' The master made I know not what
LINE 226: speeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not
LINE 227: accept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he
LINE 228: would take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed into
LINE 229: the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark
LINE 230: with what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised
LINE 231: to do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer without
LINE 232: hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see
LINE 233: that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant
LINE 234: abroad."
LINE 235: "All that your worship has said is quite true," answered the lad; "but
LINE 236: the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your
LINE 237: worship supposes."
LINE 238: "How! the opposite?" said Don Quixote; "did not the clown pay thee
LINE 239: then?"
LINE 240: "Not only did he not pay me," replied the lad, "but as soon as your
LINE 241: worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up
LINE 242: again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a
LINE 243: flayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up
LINE 244: with some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and
LINE 245: but for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he
LINE 246: said. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until
LINE 247: now in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally
LINE 248: clown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for
LINE 249: if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for
LINE 250: you, nor meddled in other people's affairs, my master would have been
LINE 251: content with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then
LINE 252: loosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him
LINE 253: so out of measure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger was
LINE 254: kindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw
LINE 255: you had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as
LINE 256: if I should never be a man again."
LINE 257: "The mischief," said Don Quixote, "lay in my going away; for I should
LINE 258: not have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known
LINE 259: well by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word
LINE 260: if he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest,
LINE 261: Andres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him,
LINE 262: and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly."
LINE 263: "That is true," said Andres; "but it was of no use."
LINE 264: "Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not," said Don Quixote; and
LINE 265: so saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was
LINE 266: browsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to
LINE 267: do. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise
LINE 268: him for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last
LINE 269: maravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To
LINE 270: which she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his
LINE 271: promise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded
LINE 272: hers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain
LINE 273: his ardour until his return from her kingdom.
LINE 274: "That is true," said Don Quixote, "and Andres must have patience until
LINE 275: my return as you say, señora; but I once more swear and promise not to
LINE 276: stop until I have seen him avenged and paid."
LINE 277: "I have no faith in those oaths," said Andres; "I would rather have now
LINE 278: something to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the
LINE 279: world; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give
LINE 280: it me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may
LINE 281: their errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me."
LINE 282: Sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese,
LINE 283: and giving them to the lad he said, "Here, take this, brother Andres,
LINE 284: for we have all of us a share in your misfortune."
LINE 285: "Why, what share have you got?"
LINE 286: "This share of bread and cheese I am giving you," answered Sancho; "and
LINE 287: God knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I
LINE 288: would have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to
LINE 289: bear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things
LINE 290: more easily felt than told."
LINE 291: Andres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him
LINE 292: anything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying
LINE 293: is. However, before leaving he said, "For the love of God, sir
LINE 294: knight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them
LINE 295: cutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my
LINE 296: misfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to
LINE 297: me by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant
LINE 298: that have ever been born God send his curse."
LINE 299: Don Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at
LINE 300: such a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily
LINE 301: chapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres' story, and the others had to take
LINE 302: great care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out
LINE 303: of countenance.

LINE 305: CHAPTER XXXII.
LINE 306: WHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE'S PARTY AT THE INN
LINE 307: c32a.jpg (132K)
LINE 308: Full Size
LINE 309: Their dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without
LINE 310: any adventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, the
LINE 311: object of Sancho Panza's fear and dread; but though he would have
LINE 312: rather not entered it, there was no help for it. The landlady, the
LINE 313: landlord, their daughter, and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and
LINE 314: Sancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of hearty
LINE 315: satisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, and
LINE 316: bade them make up a better bed for him than the last time: to which the
LINE 317: landlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time she
LINE 318: would give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote said he would, so they
LINE 319: made up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he
LINE 320: lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep.
LINE 321: No sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the
LINE 322: barber, and seizing him by the beard, said:
LINE 323: "By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer;
LINE 324: you must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of
LINE 325: my husband's goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I
LINE 326: used to stick in my good tail."
LINE 327: But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the
LINE 328: licentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further
LINE 329: occasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and
LINE 330: appear in his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to
LINE 331: this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he
LINE 332: ask for the princess's squire, they could tell him that she had sent
LINE 333: him on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she
LINE 334: was coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On this
LINE 335: the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the
LINE 336: same time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect
LINE 337: Don Quixote's deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with
LINE 338: astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure
LINE 339: of the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as
LINE 340: there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment,
LINE 341: served them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was
LINE 342: asleep, and they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would
LINE 343: now do him more good than eating.
LINE 344: While at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife,
LINE 345: their daughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the
LINE 346: strange craze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found;
LINE 347: and the landlady told them what had taken place between him and the
LINE 348: carrier; and then, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she
LINE 349: saw he was not, she gave them the whole story of his blanketing, which
LINE 350: they received with no little amusement. But on the curate observing
LINE 351: that it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had
LINE 352: turned his brain, the landlord said:
LINE 353: "I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is
LINE 354: no better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them,
LINE 355: with other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of
LINE 356: plenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on
LINE 357: holidays, and there is always one among them who can read and who takes
LINE 358: up one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us,
LINE 359: and stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow
LINE 360: young again. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of what
LINE 361: furious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the
LINE 362: longing to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night
LINE 363: and day."
LINE 364: "And I just as much," said the landlady, "because I never have a quiet
LINE 365: moment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading;
LINE 366: for then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to
LINE 367: scold."
LINE 368: "That is true," said Maritornes; "and, faith, I relish hearing these
LINE 369: things greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they
LINE 370: describe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the
LINE 371: orange trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead
LINE 372: with envy and fright; all this I say is as good as honey."
LINE 373: "And you, what do you think, young lady?" said the curate turning to
LINE 374: the landlord's daughter.
LINE 375: "I don't know indeed, señor," said she; "I listen too, and to tell the
LINE 376: truth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not
LINE 377: the blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights
LINE 378: utter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they
LINE 379: sometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them."
LINE 380: "Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?"
LINE 381: said Dorothea.
LINE 382: "I don't know what I should do," said the girl; "I only know that there
LINE 383: are some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers
LINE 384: and lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don't know what
LINE 385: sort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than
LINE 386: bestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I
LINE 387: don't know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour's
LINE 388: sake, why not marry them? That's all they want."
LINE 389: "Hush, child," said the landlady; "it seems to me thou knowest a great
LINE 390: deal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so
LINE 391: much."
LINE 392: "As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him," said the
LINE 393: girl.
LINE 394: "Well then," said the curate, "bring me these books, señor landlord,
LINE 395: for I should like to see them."
LINE 396: "With all my heart," said he, and going into his own room he brought
LINE 397: out an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the
LINE 398: curate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a
LINE 399: very good hand. The first that he opened he found to be "Don Cirongilio
LINE 400: of Thrace," and the second "Don Felixmarte of Hircania," and the other
LINE 401: the "History of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with
LINE 402: the Life of Diego García de Paredes."
LINE 403: When the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber
LINE 404: and said, "We want my friend's housekeeper and niece here now."
LINE 405: "Nay," said the barber, "I can do just as well to carry them to the
LINE 406: yard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there."
LINE 407: "What! your worship would burn my books!" said the landlord.
LINE 408: "Only these two," said the curate, "Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte."
LINE 409: "Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn
LINE 410: them?" said the landlord.
LINE 411: "Schismatics you mean, friend," said the barber, "not phlegmatics."
LINE 412: "That's it," said the landlord; "but if you want to burn any, let it be
LINE 413: that about the Great Captain and that Diego García; for I would rather
LINE 414: have a child of mine burnt than either of the others."
LINE 415: "Brother," said the curate, "those two books are made up of lies, and
LINE 416: are full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true
LINE 417: history, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by
LINE 418: his many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of
LINE 419: the Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him
LINE 420: alone; and this Diego García de Paredes was a distinguished knight of
LINE 421: the city of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of
LINE 422: such bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in
LINE 423: full motion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge
LINE 424: he kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved
LINE 425: such other exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself with
LINE 426: the modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some free
LINE 427: and unbiased writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into the
LINE 428: shade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands."

LINE 431: "Tell that to my father," said the landlord. "There's a thing to be
LINE 432: astonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read
LINE 433: what I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single
LINE 434: backstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they
LINE 435: had been made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make;
LINE 436: and another time he attacked a very great and powerful army, in which
LINE 437: there were more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed
LINE 438: from head to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of
LINE 439: sheep."

LINE 442: "And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was
LINE 443: so stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that
LINE 444: as he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the
LINE 445: water against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung
LINE 446: himself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed
LINE 447: its throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he
LINE 448: was throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the
LINE 449: bottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go
LINE 450: his hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces
LINE 451: and gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent
LINE 452: changed itself into an old ancient man, who told him such things as
LINE 453: were never heard. Hold your peace, señor; for if you were to hear this
LINE 454: you would go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain
LINE 455: and your Diego García!"
LINE 456: Hearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, "Our landlord is
LINE 457: almost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote."
LINE 458: "I think so," said Cardenio, "for, as he shows, he accepts it as a
LINE 459: certainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it
LINE 460: is written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not
LINE 461: persuade him to the contrary."
LINE 462: "But consider, brother," said the curate once more, "there never was
LINE 463: any Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace,
LINE 464: or any of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of
LINE 465: chivalry talk of; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of
LINE 466: idle wits, devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling
LINE 467: the time, as your reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in all
LINE 468: seriousness there never were any such knights in the world, and no such
LINE 469: exploits or nonsense ever happened anywhere."
LINE 470: "Try that bone on another dog," said the landlord; "as if I did not
LINE 471: know how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don't think to
LINE 472: feed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your
LINE 473: worship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is
LINE 474: nonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the
LINE 475: Royal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot of
LINE 476: lies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments
LINE 477: that they take away one's senses."
LINE 478: "I have told you, friend," said the curate, "that this is done to
LINE 479: divert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess,
LINE 480: fives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not
LINE 481: care, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind
LINE 482: are allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the
LINE 483: truth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true
LINE 484: stories; and if it were permitted me now, and the present company
LINE 485: desired it, I could say something about the qualities books of chivalry
LINE 486: should possess to be good ones, that would be to the advantage and even
LINE 487: to the taste of some; but I hope the time will come when I can
LINE 488: communicate my ideas to someone who may be able to mend matters; and in
LINE 489: the meantime, señor landlord, believe what I have said, and take your
LINE 490: books, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and much
LINE 491: good may they do you; and God grant you may not fall lame of the same
LINE 492: foot your guest Don Quixote halts on."
LINE 493: "No fear of that," returned the landlord; "I shall not be so mad as to
LINE 494: make a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are
LINE 495: not now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous
LINE 496: knights roamed about the world."
LINE 497: Sancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and
LINE 498: he was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about
LINE 499: knights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry
LINE 500: being folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what
LINE 501: came of this journey of his master's, and if it did not turn out as
LINE 502: happily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back
LINE 503: to his wife and children and his ordinary labour.
LINE 504: The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate
LINE 505: said to him, "Wait; I want to see what those papers are that are
LINE 506: written in such a good hand." The landlord taking them out handed them
LINE 507: to him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets
LINE 508: of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of
LINE 509: "Novel of the Ill-advised Curiosity." The curate read three or four
LINE 510: lines to himself, and said, "I must say the title of this novel does
LINE 511: not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all." To
LINE 512: which the landlord replied, "Then your reverence will do well to read
LINE 513: it, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been
LINE 514: much pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I
LINE 515: would not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the
LINE 516: valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time
LINE 517: or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to
LINE 518: return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian."
LINE 519: "You are very right, friend," said the curate; "but for all that, if
LINE 520: the novel pleases me you must let me copy it."
LINE 521: "With all my heart," replied the host.
LINE 522: While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to
LINE 523: read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged
LINE 524: him to read it so that they might all hear it.
LINE 525: "I would read it," said the curate, "if the time would not be better
LINE 526: spent in sleeping."
LINE 527: "It will be rest enough for me," said Dorothea, "to while away the time
LINE 528: by listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough
LINE 529: to let me sleep when it would be seasonable."
LINE 530: "Well then, in that case," said the curate, "I will read it, if it were
LINE 531: only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant."
LINE 532: Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho
LINE 533: too; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all,
LINE 534: and receive it himself, the curate said, "Well then, attend to me
LINE 535: everyone, for the novel begins thus."
