LINE 3: These preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the
LINE 4: execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world
LINE 5: was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,
LINE 6: grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and
LINE 7: duties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to
LINE 8: anyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning
LINE 9: of the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he
LINE 10: donned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet
LINE 11: on, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the
LINE 12: yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and
LINE 13: satisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his
LINE 14: grand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain,
LINE 15: when a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him
LINE 16: abandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that he
LINE 17: had not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry
LINE 18: he neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that
LINE 19: even if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white
LINE 20: armour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had
LINE 21: earned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his
LINE 22: craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have
LINE 23: himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the
LINE 24: example of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that
LINE 25: brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the
LINE 26: first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and
LINE 27: so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse
LINE 28: chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.
LINE 29: Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to
LINE 30: himself and saying, "Who knows but that in time to come, when the
LINE 31: veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes
LINE 32: it, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will
LINE 33: do it after this fashion? 'Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o'er
LINE 34: the face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright
LINE 35: hair, scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their
LINE 36: notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the
LINE 37: rosy Dawn, that, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was
LINE 38: appearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan
LINE 39: horizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting
LINE 40: the lazy down, mounted his celebrated steed Rocinante and began to
LINE 41: traverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;'" which in fact he
LINE 42: was actually traversing. "Happy the age, happy the time," he continued,
LINE 43: "in which shall be made known my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in
LINE 44: brass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever.
LINE 45: And thou, O sage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to
LINE 46: be the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee,
LINE 47: my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings."
LINE 48: Presently he broke out again, as if he were love-stricken in earnest,
LINE 49: "O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast
LINE 50: thou done me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy
LINE 51: banish me from the presence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold in
LINE 52: remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love
LINE 53: of thee."
LINE 54: So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in
LINE 55: the style of those his books had taught him, imitating their language
LINE 56: as well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun
LINE 57: mounted so rapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his
LINE 58: brains if he had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything
LINE 59: remarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was
LINE 60: anxious to encounter someone at once upon whom to try the might of his
LINE 61: strong arm.

LINE 64: Writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of
LINE 65: Puerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have
LINE 66: ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals
LINE 67: of La Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall
LINE 68: his hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking
LINE 69: all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty
LINE 70: where he might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived
LINE 71: not far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding
LINE 72: him to the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and
LINE 73: quickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting in. At the
LINE 74: door were standing two young women, girls of the district as they call
LINE 75: them, on their way to Seville with some carriers who had chanced to
LINE 76: halt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to our
LINE 77: adventurer, everything he saw or imagined seemed to him to be and to
LINE 78: happen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he saw the inn
LINE 79: he pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and
LINE 80: pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the drawbridge and moat and
LINE 81: all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To this
LINE 82: inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance
LINE 83: from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would show himself
LINE 84: upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight
LINE 85: was approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slow about it,
LINE 86: and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for the
LINE 87: inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there,
LINE 88: and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladies taking
LINE 89: their ease at the castle gate.
LINE 90: At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through
LINE 91: the stubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that
LINE 92: is what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them
LINE 93: together, and forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was
LINE 94: expecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with
LINE 95: prodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who,
LINE 96: seeing a man of this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and
LINE 97: buckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote,
LINE 98: guessing their fear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor,
LINE 99: disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and gentle
LINE 100: voice addressed them, "Your ladyships need not fly or fear any
LINE 101: rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order of knighthood which I
LINE 102: profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your
LINE 103: appearance proclaims you to be." The girls were looking at him and
LINE 104: straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visor
LINE 105: obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so
LINE 106: much out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which
LINE 107: made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, "Modesty becomes the fair, and
LINE 108: moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this,
LINE 109: however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other
LINE 110: than to serve you."
LINE 111: The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier
LINE 112: only increased the ladies' laughter, and that increased his irritation,
LINE 113: and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had
LINE 114: not come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,
LINE 115: seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more
LINE 116: than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all
LINE 117: indisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement;
LINE 118: but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he
LINE 119: thought it best to speak him fairly, so he said, "Señor Caballero, if
LINE 120: your worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the
LINE 121: inn) there is plenty of everything else here." Don Quixote, observing
LINE 122: the respectful bearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper
LINE 123: and inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, "Sir Castellan, for me
LINE 124: anything will suffice, for
LINE 125: 'My armour is my only wear,
LINE 126: My only rest the fray.'"
LINE 127: The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a
LINE 128: "worthy of Castile," though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from
LINE 129: the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of
LINE 130: tricks as a student or a page. "In that case," said he,
LINE 131: "'Your bed is on the flinty rock,
LINE 132: Your sleep to watch alway;'
LINE 133: and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of
LINE 134: sleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a
LINE 135: single night." So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don
LINE 136: Quixote, who got down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had
LINE 137: not broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take great
LINE 138: care of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread
LINE 139: in this world. The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good
LINE 140: as Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in the
LINE 141: stable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the
LINE 142: damsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were now
LINE 143: relieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate and
LINE 144: backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or
LINE 145: remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green
LINE 146: ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut.
LINE 147: This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all
LINE 148: the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can
LINE 149: be imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking the
LINE 150: baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the
LINE 151: castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:
LINE 152: "Oh, never, surely, was there knight
LINE 153: So served by hand of dame,
LINE 154: As served was he, Don Quixote hight,
LINE 155: When from his town he came;
LINE 156: With maidens waiting on himself,
LINE 157: Princesses on his hack—
LINE 158: —or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse's name, and Don
LINE 159: Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of
LINE 160: declaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had
LINE 161: made me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to
LINE 162: the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether
LINE 163: prematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to command
LINE 164: and me to obey, and then the might of my arm will show my desire to
LINE 165: serve you."
LINE 166: The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had
LINE 167: nothing to say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to
LINE 168: eat. "I would gladly eat a bit of something," said Don Quixote, "for I
LINE 169: feel it would come very seasonably." The day happened to be a Friday,
LINE 170: and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they
LINE 171: call in Castile "abadejo," in Andalusia "bacallao," and in some places
LINE 172: "curadillo," and in others "troutlet;" so they asked him if he thought
LINE 173: he could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. "If
LINE 174: there be troutlets enough," said Don Quixote, "they will be the same
LINE 175: thing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight
LINE 176: reals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that
LINE 177: these troutlets are like veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which
LINE 178: is better than goat. But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the
LINE 179: burden and pressure of arms cannot be borne without support to the
LINE 180: inside." They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake
LINE 181: of the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse
LINE 182: cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own
LINE 183: armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his
LINE 184: helmet on and the beaver up, he could not with his own hands put
LINE 185: anything into his mouth unless someone else placed it there, and this
LINE 186: service one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to
LINE 187: drink was impossible, or would have been so had not the landlord bored
LINE 188: a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him
LINE 189: through the other; all which he bore with patience rather than sever
LINE 190: the ribbons of his helmet.
LINE 191: While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as
LINE 192: he approached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby
LINE 193: completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and
LINE 194: that they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was
LINE 195: trout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the
LINE 196: castellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise
LINE 197: and sally had been to some purpose. But still it distressed him to
LINE 198: think he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could
LINE 199: not lawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of
LINE 200: knighthood.
