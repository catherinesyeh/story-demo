LINE 3: With these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to
LINE 4: him, "In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this
LINE 5: remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and
LINE 6: strangeness of the matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and
LINE 7: abounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and
LINE 8: astonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening
LINE 9: to it that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even though
LINE 10: to-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale." And while
LINE 11: he said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to
LINE 12: him in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so
LINE 13: kindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their
LINE 14: good-will. In particular Don Fernando offered, if he would go back with
LINE 15: him, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism
LINE 16: of Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of making
LINE 17: his appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was
LINE 18: entitled to. For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously,
LINE 19: although he would not accept any of their generous offers.
LINE 20: By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a
LINE 21: coach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to
LINE 22: which the landlady replied that there was not a hand's breadth of the
LINE 23: whole inn unoccupied.
LINE 24: "Still, for all that," said one of those who had entered on horseback,
LINE 25: "room must be found for his lordship the Judge here."
LINE 26: At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, "Señor, the fact
LINE 27: is I have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him,
LINE 28: as no doubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I
LINE 29: will give up our room to accommodate his worship."
LINE 30: "Very good, so be it," said the squire; but in the meantime a man had
LINE 31: got out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and
LINE 32: post he held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore
LINE 33: showed that he was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by
LINE 34: the hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen
LINE 35: years of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so
LINE 36: graceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her
LINE 37: appearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida,
LINE 38: who were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like
LINE 39: that of this maiden's would have been hard to find. Don Quixote was
LINE 40: present at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon
LINE 41: as he saw him he said, "Your worship may with confidence enter and take
LINE 42: your ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and
LINE 43: poor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot
LINE 44: make room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have
LINE 45: beauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship
LINE 46: have in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw
LINE 47: themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend
LINE 48: themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give
LINE 49: her a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for
LINE 50: here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship
LINE 51: brings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence,
LINE 52: and beauty in its highest perfection."
LINE 53: The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote,
LINE 54: whom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure
LINE 55: than by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a
LINE 56: fresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and
LINE 57: Zoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the
LINE 58: young lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando,
LINE 59: Cardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible
LINE 60: and polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of
LINE 61: bewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair
LINE 62: ladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole
LINE 63: he could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but
LINE 64: with the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his
LINE 65: wits' end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the
LINE 66: accommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been
LINE 67: before settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has
LINE 68: been already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to
LINE 69: guard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his
LINE 70: daughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did
LINE 71: very willingly; and with part of the host's narrow bed and half of what
LINE 72: the Judge had brought with him, they made a more comfortable
LINE 73: arrangement for the night than they had expected.
LINE 74: The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the
LINE 75: Judge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the
LINE 76: servants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew
LINE 77: from what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was
LINE 78: called the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it
LINE 79: said he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this
LINE 80: statement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this
LINE 81: was his brother who had adopted letters by his father's advice; and
LINE 82: excited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the
LINE 83: curate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that
LINE 84: the judge was his brother. The servant had further informed him that he
LINE 85: was now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the
LINE 86: Supreme Court of Mexico; and he had learned, likewise, that the young
LINE 87: lady was his daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her,
LINE 88: and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with
LINE 89: the daughter. He asked their advice as to what means he should adopt to
LINE 90: make himself known, or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he had
LINE 91: made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor, would be ashamed
LINE 92: of him, or would receive him with a warm heart.
LINE 93: "Leave it to me to find out that," said the curate; "though there is no
LINE 94: reason for supposing, señor captain, that you will not be kindly
LINE 95: received, because the worth and wisdom that your brother's bearing
LINE 96: shows him to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty
LINE 97: or insensible, or that he will not know how to estimate the accidents
LINE 98: of fortune at their proper value."
LINE 99: "Still," said the captain, "I would not make myself known abruptly, but
LINE 100: in some indirect way."
LINE 101: "I have told you already," said the curate, "that I will manage it in a
LINE 102: way to satisfy us all."
LINE 103: By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the
LINE 104: table, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in
LINE 105: their own room. In the middle of supper the curate said:
LINE 106: "I had a comrade of your worship's name, Señor Judge, in
LINE 107: Constantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that same
LINE 108: comrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole
LINE 109: Spanish infantry; but he had as large a share of misfortune as he had
LINE 110: of gallantry and courage."
LINE 111: "And how was the captain called, señor?" asked the Judge.
LINE 112: "He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma," replied the curate, "and he was
LINE 113: born in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a
LINE 114: circumstance connected with his father and his brothers which, had it
LINE 115: not been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down
LINE 116: as one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for
LINE 117: he said his father had divided his property among his three sons and
LINE 118: had addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato's. But I
LINE 119: can say this much, that the choice he made of going to the wars was
LINE 120: attended with such success, that by his gallant conduct and courage,
LINE 121: and without any help save his own merit, he rose in a few years to be
LINE 122: captain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and in
LINE 123: position to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortune
LINE 124: was against him, for where he might have expected her favour he lost
LINE 125: it, and with it his liberty, on that glorious day when so many
LINE 126: recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine at the Goletta,
LINE 127: and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades at
LINE 128: Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with one of the
LINE 129: most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world."
LINE 130: Here the curate went on to relate briefly his brother's adventure with
LINE 131: Zoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he
LINE 132: never before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only
LINE 133: went so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were
LINE 134: in the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the
LINE 135: fair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what
LINE 136: became of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to
LINE 137: France by the Frenchmen.
LINE 138: The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the
LINE 139: curate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon
LINE 140: as he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep
LINE 141: sigh and said with his eyes full of tears, "Oh, señor, if you only knew
LINE 142: what news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show
LINE 143: how I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all
LINE 144: my worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak
LINE 145: of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than
LINE 146: my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of
LINE 147: arms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as
LINE 148: your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I
LINE 149: followed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised
LINE 150: me to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru,
LINE 151: so wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has
LINE 152: fully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my
LINE 153: father's hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity,
LINE 154: while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming
LINE 155: and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father
LINE 156: is still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son,
LINE 157: and he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he
LINE 158: has looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprises
LINE 159: me is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should have
LINE 160: neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his
LINE 161: troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or any
LINE 162: of us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that
LINE 163: miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is
LINE 164: the uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to
LINE 165: liberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me
LINE 166: continue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but
LINE 167: in the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only
LINE 168: knew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and
LINE 169: deliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering
LINE 170: myself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou art
LINE 171: alive, even wert thou in the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth
LINE 172: and my brother's and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and
LINE 173: generous Zoraida, that I could repay thy goodness to a brother! That I
LINE 174: could be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal that
LINE 175: would give us all such happiness!"
LINE 176: All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news
LINE 177: he had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it,
LINE 178: showing their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how
LINE 179: well he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain's
LINE 180: wishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from
LINE 181: the table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the
LINE 182: hand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge's daughter following her. The
LINE 183: captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter,
LINE 184: taking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the
LINE 185: Judge and the other gentlemen were and said, "Let your tears cease to
LINE 186: flow, Señor Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as
LINE 187: you could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your
LINE 188: good sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and
LINE 189: this is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told
LINE 190: you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may
LINE 191: show the generosity of your kind heart."
LINE 192: The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his
LINE 193: breast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off
LINE 194: but as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms
LINE 195: so closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those
LINE 196: present could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged,
LINE 197: the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less
LINE 198: put down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of
LINE 199: their lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its
LINE 200: strength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at
LINE 201: her disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair
LINE 202: Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. And
LINE 203: there was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings
LINE 204: attentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to
LINE 205: chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and
LINE 206: Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to his
LINE 207: father of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him to
LINE 208: come and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was
LINE 209: impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was informed
LINE 210: that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville for
LINE 211: New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great
LINE 212: inconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at
LINE 213: the captive's good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night
LINE 214: were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don
LINE 215: Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be
LINE 216: attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the
LINE 217: great treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him
LINE 218: returned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an
LINE 219: account of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little
LINE 220: amused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for
LINE 221: retiring to rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most
LINE 222: comfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass,
LINE 223: which, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear.
LINE 224: The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others
LINE 225: having disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don
LINE 226: Quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he
LINE 227: had promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach
LINE 228: of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies
LINE 229: that it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea,
LINE 230: who had been awake, and by whose side Doña Clara de Viedma, for so the
LINE 231: Judge's daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it
LINE 232: was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any
LINE 233: instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in
LINE 234: the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all
LINE 235: attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, "Listen,
LINE 236: whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer's voice that
LINE 237: enchants as it chants."
LINE 238: "We are listening to it already, señor," said Dorothea; on which
LINE 239: Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made
LINE 240: out the words of the song to be these:
