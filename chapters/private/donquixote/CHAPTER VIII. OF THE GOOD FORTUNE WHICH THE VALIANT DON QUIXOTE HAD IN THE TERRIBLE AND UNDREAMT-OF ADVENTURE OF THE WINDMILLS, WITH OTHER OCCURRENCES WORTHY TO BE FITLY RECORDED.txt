LINE 3: At this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that
LINE 4: there are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to
LINE 5: his squire, "Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could
LINE 6: have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza,
LINE 7: where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I
LINE 8: mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin
LINE 9: to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God's
LINE 10: good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth."
LINE 11: "What giants?" said Sancho Panza.
LINE 12: "Those thou seest there," answered his master, "with the long arms, and
LINE 13: some have them nearly two leagues long."
LINE 14: "Look, your worship," said Sancho; "what we see there are not giants
LINE 15: but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned
LINE 16: by the wind make the millstone go."
LINE 17: "It is easy to see," replied Don Quixote, "that thou art not used to
LINE 18: this business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid,
LINE 19: away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage
LINE 20: them in fierce and unequal combat."
LINE 21: So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the
LINE 22: cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly
LINE 23: they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however,
LINE 24: was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of
LINE 25: Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them
LINE 26: shouting, "Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight
LINE 27: attacks you."
LINE 28: A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to
LINE 29: move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, "Though ye flourish more arms
LINE 30: than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me."
LINE 31: So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady
LINE 32: Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in
LINE 33: rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's fullest
LINE 34: gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as
LINE 35: he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with
LINE 36: such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse
LINE 37: and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition.
LINE 38: Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when
LINE 39: he came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante
LINE 40: fallen with him.

LINE 43: "God bless me!" said Sancho, "did I not tell your worship to mind what
LINE 44: you were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have
LINE 45: made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in
LINE 46: his head."
LINE 47: "Hush, friend Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "the fortunes of war more
LINE 48: than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I
LINE 49: think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off
LINE 50: my study and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob
LINE 51: me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me;
LINE 52: but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good
LINE 53: sword."

LINE 56: "God order it as he may," said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise
LINE 57: got him up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,
LINE 58: discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,
LINE 59: for there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in
LINE 60: abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he
LINE 61: was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,
LINE 62: he added, "I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de
LINE 63: Vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a
LINE 64: ponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and
LINE 65: pounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and
LINE 66: his descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I
LINE 67: mention this because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such
LINE 68: another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am determined
LINE 69: and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very
LINE 70: fortunate in being found worthy to come and see them, and be an
LINE 71: eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed."
LINE 72: "Be that as God will," said Sancho, "I believe it all as your worship
LINE 73: says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one
LINE 74: side, may be from the shaking of the fall."
LINE 75: "That is the truth," said Don Quixote, "and if I make no complaint of
LINE 76: the pain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of
LINE 77: any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it."
LINE 78: "If so," said Sancho, "I have nothing to say; but God knows I would
LINE 79: rather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I
LINE 80: confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule
LINE 81: about not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also."
LINE 82: Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire's simplicity, and he
LINE 83: assured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he
LINE 84: liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in
LINE 85: the order of knighthood.
LINE 86: Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master
LINE 87: answered that he wanted nothing himself just then, but that _he_ might
LINE 88: eat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as
LINE 89: comfortably as he could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas
LINE 90: what he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his master
LINE 91: munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota
LINE 92: with a relish that the thirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied;
LINE 93: and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught,
LINE 94: he never gave a thought to any of the promises his master had made him,
LINE 95: nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going in quest
LINE 96: of adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the
LINE 97: night among some trees, from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry
LINE 98: branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the
LINE 99: head he had removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay
LINE 100: awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to conform to what he had
LINE 101: read in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights
LINE 102: used to lie sleepless supported by the memory of their mistresses. Not
LINE 103: so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of something
LINE 104: stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his
LINE 105: master had not called him, neither the rays of the sun beating on his
LINE 106: face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of
LINE 107: day would have had power to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota
LINE 108: and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved
LINE 109: his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the
LINE 110: deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to break his fast, for, as
LINE 111: has been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for
LINE 112: nourishment.
LINE 113: They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto
LINE 114: Lapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. "Here,
LINE 115: brother Sancho Panza," said Don Quixote when he saw it, "we may plunge
LINE 116: our hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,
LINE 117: even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou
LINE 118: must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou
LINE 119: perceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in
LINE 120: that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it
LINE 121: is on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to
LINE 122: help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight."
LINE 123: "Most certainly, señor," replied Sancho, "your worship shall be fully
LINE 124: obeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no
LINE 125: friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the
LINE 126: defence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for
LINE 127: laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any
LINE 128: assailant whatever."
LINE 129: "That I grant," said Don Quixote, "but in this matter of aiding me
LINE 130: against knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural
LINE 131: impetuosity."
LINE 132: "I will do so, I promise you," answered Sancho, "and will keep this
LINE 133: precept as carefully as Sunday."
LINE 134: While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of
LINE 135: the order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less
LINE 136: tall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles
LINE 137: and carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or
LINE 138: five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there
LINE 139: was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where
LINE 140: her husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an
LINE 141: appointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,
LINE 142: were not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he
LINE 143: said to his squire, "Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the
LINE 144: most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies
LINE 145: we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off
LINE 146: some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo
LINE 147: this wrong."
LINE 148: "This will be worse than the windmills," said Sancho. "Look, señor;
LINE 149: those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some
LINE 150: travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't let
LINE 151: the devil mislead you."
LINE 152: "I have told thee already, Sancho," replied Don Quixote, "that on the
LINE 153: subject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as
LINE 154: thou shalt see presently."
LINE 155: So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road
LINE 156: along which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had
LINE 157: come near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, "Devilish and
LINE 158: unnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you
LINE 159: are carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy
LINE 160: death as the just punishment of your evil deeds."
LINE 161: The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don
LINE 162: Quixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, "Señor
LINE 163: Caballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.
LINE 164: Benedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are
LINE 165: any captive princesses coming in this coach."
LINE 166: "No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble," said Don
LINE 167: Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with
LINE 168: levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and
LINE 169: determination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,
LINE 170: he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore
LINE 171: wounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his
LINE 172: comrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made
LINE 173: off across the country faster than the wind.
LINE 174: Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly
LINE 175: from his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At
LINE 176: that instant the friars' muleteers came up and asked what he was
LINE 177: stripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully
LINE 178: as spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The
LINE 179: muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this
LINE 180: about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off
LINE 181: talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him
LINE 182: down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks
LINE 183: and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and
LINE 184: without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,
LINE 185: terrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred
LINE 186: after his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,
LINE 187: watching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the
LINE 188: end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more
LINE 189: crosses than if they had the devil after them.
LINE 190: Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:
LINE 191: "Your beauty, lady mine," said he, "may now dispose of your person as
LINE 192: may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your
LINE 193: ravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;
LINE 194: and lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know
LINE 195: that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and
LINE 196: adventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del
LINE 197: Toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no
LINE 198: more than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present
LINE 199: yourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you
LINE 200: free."
LINE 201: One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was
LINE 202: listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would
LINE 203: not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to
LINE 204: El Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad
LINE 205: Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, "Begone, caballero, and
LINE 206: ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,
LINE 207: slayest thee as art here a Biscayan."
LINE 208: Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,
LINE 209: "If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already
LINE 210: chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature." To which the
LINE 211: Biscayan returned, "I no gentleman!—I swear to God thou liest as I am
LINE 212: Christian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou
LINE 213: see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at
LINE 214: sea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou
LINE 215: liest."
LINE 216: "'"You will see presently," said Agrajes,'" replied Don Quixote; and
LINE 217: throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler
LINE 218: on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.
LINE 219: The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount
LINE 220: from his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for
LINE 221: hire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was
LINE 222: lucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was
LINE 223: able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at
LINE 224: one another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove
LINE 225: to make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in
LINE 226: his disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he
LINE 227: would kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The
LINE 228: lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the
LINE 229: coachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe
LINE 230: struggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a
LINE 231: mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given
LINE 232: to one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,
LINE 233: feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, "O
LINE 234: lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this
LINE 235: your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds
LINE 236: himself in this extreme peril." To say this, to lift his sword, to
LINE 237: shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was
LINE 238: the work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a
LINE 239: single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was
LINE 240: convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to
LINE 241: follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of
LINE 242: his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his
LINE 243: mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could
LINE 244: not stir a step.
LINE 245: On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,
LINE 246: with uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,
LINE 247: while on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under
LINE 248: the protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting
LINE 249: in suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the
LINE 250: lady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand
LINE 251: vows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God
LINE 252: might deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which
LINE 253: they found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis
LINE 254: the author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as
LINE 255: excuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements
LINE 256: of Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the
LINE 257: second author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so
LINE 258: curious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,
LINE 259: or that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to
LINE 260: preserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to
LINE 261: this famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despair
LINE 262: of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven
LINE 263: favouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second
LINE 264: Part.
