LINE 2: One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
LINE 3: formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
LINE 4: dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
LINE 5: sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
LINE 6: lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
LINE 7: equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
LINE 8: were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
LINE 9: preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
LINE 10: somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
LINE 11: the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
LINE 12: shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
LINE 13: continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
LINE 14: open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
LINE 15: They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
LINE 16: astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
LINE 17: Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
LINE 18: inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
LINE 19: She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
LINE 20: other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
LINE 21: head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
LINE 22: name to her mother on her Ladyship's entrance, though no request of
LINE 23: introduction had been made.
LINE 24: Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
LINE 25: high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
LINE 26: for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--
LINE 27: "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
LINE 28: mother?"
LINE 29: Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
LINE 30: "And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?"
LINE 31: "Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.
LINE 32: "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
LINE 33: and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,
LINE 34: who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."
LINE 35: "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine, after a
LINE 36: short silence.
LINE 37: "It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I
LINE 38: assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."
LINE 39: "This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
LINE 40: summer: the windows are full west."
LINE 41: Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
LINE 42: added,--
LINE 43: "May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and
LINE 44: Mrs. Collins well?"
LINE 45: "Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."
LINE 46: Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
LINE 47: Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
LINE 48: letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
LINE 49: Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some
LINE 50: refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
LINE 51: declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--
LINE 52: "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
LINE 53: on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
LINE 54: will favour me with your company."
LINE 55: "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her Ladyship about the
LINE 56: different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."
LINE 57: Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
LINE 58: attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,
LINE 59: Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
LINE 60: drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
LINE 61: decent-looking rooms, walked on.
LINE 62: Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
LINE 63: waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
LINE 64: that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
LINE 65: conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
LINE 66: disagreeable.
LINE 67: [Illustration:
LINE 68: "After a short survey"
LINE 69: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
LINE 70: "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
LINE 71: her face.
LINE 72: As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
LINE 73: manner:--
LINE 74: "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
LINE 75: journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
LINE 76: come."
LINE 77: Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
LINE 78: "Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account
LINE 79: for the honour of seeing you here."
LINE 80: "Miss Bennet," replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
LINE 81: know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
LINE 82: choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
LINE 83: celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
LINE 84: moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
LINE 85: alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your
LINE 86: sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
LINE 87: _you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
LINE 88: afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
LINE 89: _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
LINE 90: so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on
LINE 91: setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
LINE 92: you."
LINE 93: "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
LINE 94: with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
LINE 95: so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?"
LINE 96: "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
LINE 97: "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth
LINE 98: coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report
LINE 99: is in existence."
LINE 100: "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
LINE 101: industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
LINE 102: report is spread abroad?"
LINE 103: "I never heard that it was."
LINE 104: "And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?"
LINE 105: "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_
LINE 106: may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer."
LINE 107: "This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
LINE 108: he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"
LINE 109: "Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible."
LINE 110: "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
LINE 111: reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
LINE 112: have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
LINE 113: may have drawn him in."
LINE 114: "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."
LINE 115: "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
LINE 116: language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
LINE 117: and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."
LINE 118: "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
LINE 119: this ever induce me to be explicit."
LINE 120: "Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
LINE 121: presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
LINE 122: engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?"
LINE 123: "Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
LINE 124: make an offer to me."
LINE 125: Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--
LINE 126: "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
LINE 127: they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
LINE 128: _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the
LINE 129: union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
LINE 130: accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
LINE 131: inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
LINE 132: the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
LINE 133: tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
LINE 134: propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his
LINE 135: earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"
LINE 136: "Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no
LINE 137: other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
LINE 138: kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
LINE 139: Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
LINE 140: marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by
LINE 141: honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
LINE 142: another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
LINE 143: "Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss
LINE 144: Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
LINE 145: friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
LINE 146: be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
LINE 147: Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
LINE 148: by any of us."
LINE 149: "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr.
LINE 150: Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
LINE 151: attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
LINE 152: to repine."
LINE 153: "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
LINE 154: for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
LINE 155: score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
LINE 156: here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I
LINE 157: be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's
LINE 158: whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."
LINE 159: "_That_ will make your Ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
LINE 160: but it will have no effect on _me_."
LINE 161: "I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
LINE 162: nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
LINE 163: side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
LINE 164: honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on
LINE 165: both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
LINE 166: every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
LINE 167: them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
LINE 168: connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall
LINE 169: not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
LINE 170: quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."
LINE 171: "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
LINE 172: sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
LINE 173: equal."
LINE 174: "True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But what was your mother? Who
LINE 175: are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
LINE 176: condition."
LINE 177: "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
LINE 178: not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
LINE 179: "Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?"
LINE 180: Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
LINE 181: Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
LINE 182: moment's deliberation,--
LINE 183: "I am not."
LINE 184: Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
LINE 185: "And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?"
LINE 186: "I will make no promise of the kind."
LINE 187: "Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
LINE 188: reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I
LINE 189: will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
LINE 190: assurance I require."
LINE 191: "And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
LINE 192: anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
LINE 193: your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
LINE 194: _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to
LINE 195: me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
LINE 196: his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with
LINE 197: which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
LINE 198: frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my
LINE 199: character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
LINE 200: How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
LINE 201: I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
LINE 202: mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the
LINE 203: subject."
LINE 204: "Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
LINE 205: objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no
LINE 206: stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
LINE 207: elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a
LINE 208: patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is
LINE 209: _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son
LINE 210: of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of
LINE 211: what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"
LINE 212: "You can _now_ have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered.
LINE 213: "You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to
LINE 214: the house."
LINE 215: And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
LINE 216: back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.
LINE 217: "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
LINE 218: Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
LINE 219: must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"
LINE 220: "Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."
LINE 221: "You are then resolved to have him?"
LINE 222: "I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
LINE 223: which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
LINE 224: reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
LINE 225: "It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
LINE 226: claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
LINE 227: the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."
LINE 228: "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "has any
LINE 229: possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
LINE 230: would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
LINE 231: resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
LINE 232: _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
LINE 233: concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
LINE 234: the scorn."
LINE 235: "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I
LINE 236: shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
LINE 237: ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
LINE 238: reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point."
LINE 239: In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of
LINE 240: the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--
LINE 241: "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
LINE 242: mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."
LINE 243: Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
LINE 244: Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
LINE 245: heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother
LINE 246: impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady
LINE 247: Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
LINE 248: "She did not choose it," said her daughter; "she would go."
LINE 249: "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
LINE 250: civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.
LINE 251: She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through
LINE 252: Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
LINE 253: nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"
LINE 254: Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
LINE 255: acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
