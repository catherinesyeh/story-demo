LINE 2: As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
LINE 3: or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
LINE 4: which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed
LINE 5: her.
LINE 6: "Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
LINE 7: "did he come at all?"
LINE 8: She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
LINE 9: "He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
LINE 10: was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he
LINE 11: no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think
LINE 12: no more about him."
LINE 13: Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
LINE 14: of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
LINE 15: better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.
LINE 16: "Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
LINE 17: easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
LINE 18: his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
LINE 19: seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
LINE 20: acquaintance."
LINE 21: "Yes, very indifferent, indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane!
LINE 22: take care."
LINE 23: "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now."
LINE 24: "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
LINE 25: you as ever."
LINE 26: They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
LINE 27: the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
LINE 28: good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit,
LINE 29: had revived.
LINE 30: On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
LINE 31: who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
LINE 32: sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
LINE 33: dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
LINE 34: the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
LINE 35: her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
LINE 36: invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
LINE 37: hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
LINE 38: decided. He placed himself by her.
LINE 39: Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He
LINE 40: bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
LINE 41: Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
LINE 42: likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
LINE 43: alarm.
LINE 44: His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
LINE 45: admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
LINE 46: Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
LINE 47: own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
LINE 48: consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
LINE 49: gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
LINE 50: no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
LINE 51: could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
LINE 52: such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
LINE 53: advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
LINE 54: she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
LINE 55: cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness
LINE 56: made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
LINE 57: and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
LINE 58: him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
LINE 59: the family.
LINE 60: She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
LINE 61: bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
LINE 62: without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,
LINE 63: than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and
LINE 64: uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
LINE 65: came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
LINE 66: She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
LINE 67: chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
LINE 68: "If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
LINE 69: ever."
LINE 70: The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
LINE 71: answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
LINE 72: where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
LINE 73: in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her
LINE 74: which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
LINE 75: the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--
LINE 76: "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
LINE 77: do we?"
LINE 78: Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
LINE 79: her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
LINE 80: to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
LINE 81: being so silly!
LINE 82: "A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
LINE 83: expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not
LINE 84: protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
LINE 85: There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings."
LINE 86: She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
LINE 87: himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--
LINE 88: "Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
LINE 89: "Yes; she will remain there till Christmas."
LINE 90: "And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
LINE 91: "Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough
LINE 92: these three weeks."
LINE 93: She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
LINE 94: with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
LINE 95: some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
LINE 96: to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
LINE 97: When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
LINE 98: all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
LINE 99: all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
LINE 100: mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
LINE 101: with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
LINE 102: They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
LINE 103: nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
LINE 104: of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
LINE 105: Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
LINE 106: supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
LINE 107: others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
LINE 108: "Well, girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what
LINE 109: say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I
LINE 110: assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
LINE 111: venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
LINE 112: a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
LINE 113: Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges
LINE 114: were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
LINE 115: cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
LINE 116: beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
LINE 117: what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
LINE 118: at Netherfield at last!' She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as
LINE 119: good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
LINE 120: girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."
LINE 121: [Illustration:
LINE 122: "M^{rs}. Long and her nieces."
LINE 123: ]
LINE 124: Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
LINE 125: Bingley's behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at
LINE 126: last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
LINE 127: humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
LINE 128: not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
LINE 129: "It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The
LINE 130: party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
LINE 131: may often meet again."
LINE 132: Elizabeth smiled.
LINE 133: "Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I
LINE 134: assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
LINE 135: agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am
LINE 136: perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
LINE 137: any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with
LINE 138: greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
LINE 139: pleasing, than any other man."
LINE 140: "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
LINE 141: are provoking me to it every moment."
LINE 142: "How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in
LINE 143: others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
LINE 144: acknowledge?"
LINE 145: "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
LINE 146: instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
LINE 147: me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
LINE 148: confidante."
LINE 149: [Illustration:
LINE 150: "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak to you."
