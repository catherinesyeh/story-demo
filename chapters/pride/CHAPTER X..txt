LINE 1: [Illustration]
LINE 2: The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
LINE 3: Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
LINE 4: continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined
LINE 5: their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
LINE 6: Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
LINE 7: the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
LINE 8: messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
LINE 9: Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
LINE 10: Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
LINE 11: attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
LINE 12: commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
LINE 13: of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
LINE 14: with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
LINE 15: exactly in unison with her opinion of each.
LINE 16: "How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
LINE 17: He made no answer.
LINE 18: "You write uncommonly fast."
LINE 19: "You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."
LINE 20: "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
LINE 21: year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"
LINE 22: "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."
LINE 23: "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
LINE 24: "I have already told her so once, by your desire."
LINE 25: "I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
LINE 26: pens remarkably well."
LINE 27: "Thank you--but I always mend my own."
LINE 28: "How can you contrive to write so even?"
LINE 29: He was silent.
LINE 30: "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
LINE 31: and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
LINE 32: little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
LINE 33: Grantley's."
LINE 34: "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
LINE 35: present I have not room to do them justice."
LINE 36: "Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
LINE 37: always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"
LINE 38: "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
LINE 39: to determine."
LINE 40: "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
LINE 41: ease cannot write ill."
LINE 42: "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
LINE 43: brother, "because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much
LINE 44: for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"
LINE 45: "My style of writing is very different from yours."
LINE 46: "Oh," cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
LINE 47: imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
LINE 48: "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which
LINE 49: means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
LINE 50: "Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."
LINE 51: "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
LINE 52: humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
LINE 53: indirect boast."
LINE 54: "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
LINE 55: "The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
LINE 56: writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
LINE 57: thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
LINE 58: think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
LINE 59: quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
LINE 60: attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
LINE 61: Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
LINE 62: you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
LINE 63: panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
LINE 64: laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
LINE 65: undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"
LINE 66: "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
LINE 67: foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
LINE 68: believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
LINE 69: moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
LINE 70: precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."
LINE 71: "I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
LINE 72: would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
LINE 73: dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
LINE 74: mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
LINE 75: till next week,' you would probably do it--you would probably not
LINE 76: go--and, at another word, might stay a month."
LINE 77: "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did
LINE 78: not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
LINE 79: more than he did himself."
LINE 80: "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
LINE 81: friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
LINE 82: afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
LINE 83: intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
LINE 84: circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
LINE 85: could."
LINE 86: "Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
LINE 87: as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
LINE 88: "Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for
LINE 89: himself."
LINE 90: "You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
LINE 91: but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
LINE 92: stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
LINE 93: that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
LINE 94: the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
LINE 95: one argument in favour of its propriety."
LINE 96: "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
LINE 97: with you."
LINE 98: "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
LINE 99: either."
LINE 100: "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
LINE 101: friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
LINE 102: one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
LINE 103: one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
LINE 104: supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
LINE 105: circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
LINE 106: thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
LINE 107: where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
LINE 108: very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
LINE 109: with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
LINE 110: "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
LINE 111: with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
LINE 112: appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
LINE 113: between the parties?"
LINE 114: "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
LINE 115: forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
LINE 116: weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
LINE 117: you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
LINE 118: myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
LINE 119: know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in
LINE 120: particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
LINE 121: when he has nothing to do."
LINE 122: Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
LINE 123: rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
LINE 124: resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
LINE 125: brother for talking such nonsense.
LINE 126: "I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument,
LINE 127: and want to silence this."
LINE 128: "Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
LINE 129: Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
LINE 130: thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
LINE 131: "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
LINE 132: Darcy had much better finish his letter."
LINE 133: Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
LINE 134: When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
LINE 135: for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
LINE 136: the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the
LINE 137: way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
LINE 138: seated herself.
LINE 139: Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
LINE 140: Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
LINE 141: that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
LINE 142: on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
LINE 143: admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
LINE 144: he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,
LINE 145: at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
LINE 146: more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
LINE 147: any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
LINE 148: him too little to care for his approbation.
LINE 149: After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
LINE 150: lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
LINE 151: Elizabeth, said to her,--
LINE 152: "Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
LINE 153: opportunity of dancing a reel?"
LINE 154: She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
LINE 155: surprise at her silence.
LINE 156: "Oh," said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
LINE 157: determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
LINE 158: that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
LINE 159: delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
LINE 160: their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
LINE 161: you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
LINE 162: dare."
LINE 163: "Indeed I do not dare."
LINE 164: Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
LINE 165: gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
LINE 166: manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had
LINE 167: never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
LINE 168: believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
LINE 169: should be in some danger.
LINE 170: Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
LINE 171: anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
LINE 172: assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
LINE 173: She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
LINE 174: their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
LINE 175: "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
LINE 176: next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
LINE 177: desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
LINE 178: and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
LINE 179: the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
LINE 180: check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
LINE 181: which your lady possesses."
LINE 182: [Illustration:
LINE 183: "No, no; stay where you are"

LINE 185: "Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
LINE 186: "Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed
LINE 187: in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
LINE 188: judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
LINE 189: lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
LINE 190: taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
LINE 191: "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
LINE 192: colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
LINE 193: copied."
LINE 194: At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
LINE 195: Elizabeth herself.
LINE 196: "I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
LINE 197: confusion, lest they had been overheard.
LINE 198: "You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without
LINE 199: telling us that you were coming out."
LINE 200: Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
LINE 201: by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
LINE 202: and immediately said,--
LINE 203: "This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
LINE 204: avenue."
LINE 205: But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
LINE 206: laughingly answered,--
LINE 207: "No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
LINE 208: uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
LINE 209: fourth. Good-bye."
LINE 210: She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
LINE 211: being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
LINE 212: as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
