LINE 1: The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
LINE 2: Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
LINE 3: continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
LINE 4: their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.
LINE 5: Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
LINE 6: the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
LINE 7: messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
LINE 8: Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
LINE 9: Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
LINE 10: attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
LINE 11: commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
LINE 12: of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
LINE 13: with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
LINE 14: exactly in unison with her opinion of each.
LINE 15: "How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
LINE 16: He made no answer.
LINE 17: "You write uncommonly fast."
LINE 18: "You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."
LINE 19: "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the
LINE 20: year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"
LINE 21: "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."
LINE 22: "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
LINE 23: "I have already told her so once, by your desire."
LINE 24: "I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
LINE 25: pens remarkably well."
LINE 26: "Thank you--but I always mend my own."
LINE 27: "How can you contrive to write so even?"
LINE 28: He was silent.
LINE 29: "Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
LINE 30: and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
LINE 31: little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
LINE 32: Grantley's."
LINE 33: "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At
LINE 34: present I have not room to do them justice."
LINE 35: "Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
LINE 36: always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"
LINE 37: "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
LINE 38: to determine."
LINE 39: "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with
LINE 40: ease, cannot write ill."
LINE 41: "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
LINE 42: brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
LINE 43: words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?"
LINE 44: "My style of writing is very different from yours."
LINE 45: "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
LINE 46: imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
LINE 47: "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
LINE 48: means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
LINE 49: "Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."
LINE 50: "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
LINE 51: humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
LINE 52: indirect boast."
LINE 53: "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
LINE 54: "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in
LINE 55: writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
LINE 56: thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think
LINE 57: at least highly interesting. The power of doing any thing with
LINE 58: quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
LINE 59: attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
LINE 60: Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
LINE 61: you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
LINE 62: panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
LINE 63: laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
LINE 64: undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"
LINE 65: "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
LINE 66: foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I
LINE 67: believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
LINE 68: moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
LINE 69: precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies."
LINE 70: "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
LINE 71: would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
LINE 72: dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
LINE 73: mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay
LINE 74: till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
LINE 75: go--and, at another word, might stay a month."
LINE 76: "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did
LINE 77: not do justice to his own disposition. You have shewn him off now much
LINE 78: more than he did himself."
LINE 79: "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
LINE 80: friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
LINE 81: afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
LINE 82: intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a
LINE 83: circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
LINE 84: could."
LINE 85: "Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
LINE 86: as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
LINE 87: "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for
LINE 88: himself."
LINE 89: "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but
LINE 90: which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand
LINE 91: according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that
LINE 92: the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the
LINE 93: delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one
LINE 94: argument in favour of its propriety."
LINE 95: "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
LINE 96: with you."
LINE 97: "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
LINE 98: either."
LINE 99: "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
LINE 100: friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
LINE 101: one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
LINE 102: one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
LINE 103: supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
LINE 104: circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
LINE 105: thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
LINE 106: where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
LINE 107: very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
LINE 108: with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
LINE 109: "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
LINE 110: with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
LINE 111: appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
LINE 112: between the parties?"
LINE 113: "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
LINE 114: forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
LINE 115: weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
LINE 116: you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
LINE 117: myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
LINE 118: know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
LINE 119: particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening
LINE 120: when he has nothing to do."
LINE 121: Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
LINE 122: rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
LINE 123: resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
LINE 124: brother for talking such nonsense.
LINE 125: "I see your design, Bingley," said his friend.--"You dislike an
LINE 126: argument, and want to silence this."
LINE 127: "Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
LINE 128: Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
LINE 129: thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."
LINE 130: "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
LINE 131: Darcy had much better finish his letter."
LINE 132: Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
LINE 133: When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
LINE 134: for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
LINE 135: the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
LINE 136: the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
LINE 137: seated herself.
LINE 138: Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed
LINE 139: Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books
LINE 140: that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
LINE 141: on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
LINE 142: admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because
LINE 143: he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine however
LINE 144: at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about
LINE 145: her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than
LINE 146: in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
LINE 147: him too little to care for his approbation.
LINE 148: After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
LINE 149: lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
LINE 150: Elizabeth, said to her--
LINE 151: "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
LINE 152: opportunity of dancing a reel?"
LINE 153: She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
LINE 154: surprise at her silence.
LINE 155: "Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
LINE 156: determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
LINE 157: that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
LINE 158: delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
LINE 159: their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell
LINE 160: you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
LINE 161: you dare."
LINE 162: "Indeed I do not dare."
LINE 163: Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
LINE 164: gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
LINE 165: manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had
LINE 166: never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
LINE 167: believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
LINE 168: should be in some danger.
LINE 169: Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
LINE 170: anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some
LINE 171: assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
LINE 172: She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
LINE 173: their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
LINE 174: "I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
LINE 175: next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
LINE 176: desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
LINE 177: and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
LINE 178: the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
LINE 179: check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
LINE 180: which your lady possesses."
LINE 181: "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
LINE 182: "Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
LINE 183: placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle
LINE 184: the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different
LINE 185: lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it
LINE 186: taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
LINE 187: "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
LINE 188: colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be
LINE 189: copied."
LINE 190: At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and
LINE 191: Elizabeth herself.
LINE 192: "I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
LINE 193: confusion, lest they had been overheard.
LINE 194: "You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running away
LINE 195: without telling us that you were coming out."
LINE 196: Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
LINE 197: by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness
LINE 198: and immediately said,--
LINE 199: "This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
LINE 200: avenue."
LINE 201: But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
LINE 202: laughingly answered,
LINE 203: "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to
LINE 204: uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
LINE 205: fourth. Good bye."
LINE 206: She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
LINE 207: being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
LINE 208: as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
