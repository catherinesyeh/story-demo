LINE 2: Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
LINE 3: the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
LINE 4: honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--
LINE 5: "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
LINE 6: are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
LINE 7: openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
LINE 8: yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
LINE 9: fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
LINE 10: _him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
LINE 11: ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you
LINE 12: must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
LINE 13: expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
LINE 14: good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."
LINE 15: "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
LINE 16: "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
LINE 17: "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
LINE 18: myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
LINE 19: can prevent it."
LINE 20: "Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
LINE 21: "I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with
LINE 22: Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
LINE 23: the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
LINE 24: me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
LINE 25: of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does
LINE 26: me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
LINE 27: father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
LINE 28: should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
LINE 29: since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
LINE 30: seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
LINE 31: engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
LINE 32: of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that
LINE 33: it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is
LINE 34: not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his
LINE 35: first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In
LINE 36: short, I will do my best."
LINE 37: "Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
LINE 38: often. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."
LINE 39: "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very
LINE 40: true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
LINE 41: that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
LINE 42: so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
LINE 43: necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
LINE 44: honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you
LINE 45: are satisfied."
LINE 46: Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for
LINE 47: the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
LINE 48: being given on such a point without being resented.
LINE 49: Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
LINE 50: by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
LINE 51: Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His
LINE 52: marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
LINE 53: as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
LINE 54: tone, that she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the
LINE 55: wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
LINE 56: when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's
LINE 57: ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
LINE 58: accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,
LINE 59: Charlotte said,--
LINE 60: "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."
LINE 61: "_That_ you certainly shall."
LINE 62: "And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?"
LINE 63: "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
LINE 64: "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
LINE 65: come to Hunsford."
LINE 66: Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
LINE 67: visit.
LINE 68: "My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and
LINE 69: I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be
LINE 70: as welcome to me as either of them."
LINE 71: The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
LINE 72: the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
LINE 73: subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
LINE 74: correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
LINE 75: should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
LINE 76: address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
LINE 77: and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
LINE 78: sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
LINE 79: were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
LINE 80: curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
LINE 81: like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
LINE 82: be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
LINE 83: expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
LINE 84: wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
LINE 85: which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
LINE 86: roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
LINE 87: friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
LINE 88: Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
LINE 89: for her own visit there, to know the rest.
LINE 90: Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their
LINE 91: safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
LINE 92: would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
LINE 93: Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
LINE 94: generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
LINE 95: hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
LINE 96: her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
LINE 97: lost.
LINE 98: "My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
LINE 99: town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."
LINE 100: She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
LINE 101: "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
LINE 102: glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
LINE 103: to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
LINE 104: I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
LINE 105: engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
LINE 106: Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was
LINE 107: not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
LINE 108: soon see them here."
LINE 109: Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
LINE 110: accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.
LINE 111: Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
LINE 112: persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
LINE 113: blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
LINE 114: for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
LINE 115: visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
LINE 116: more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself
LINE 117: no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
LINE 118: will prove what she felt:--
LINE 119: "My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
LINE 120: her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have
LINE 121: been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my
LINE 122: dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
LINE 123: obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour
LINE 124: was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at
LINE 125: all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
LINE 126: if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
LINE 127: be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
LINE 128: and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she
LINE 129: did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she
LINE 130: made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
LINE 131: word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so
LINE 132: altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
LINE 133: resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I
LINE 134: cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as
LINE 135: she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
LINE 136: her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
LINE 137: acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
LINE 138: brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and
LINE 139: though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
LINE 140: feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
LINE 141: deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
LINE 142: feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,
LINE 143: however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all
LINE 144: cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my
LINE 145: being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
LINE 146: yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
LINE 147: persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot
LINE 148: understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be
LINE 149: almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
LINE 150: duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful
LINE 151: thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
LINE 152: and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear
LINE 153: from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never
LINE 154: returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
LINE 155: with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely
LINE 156: glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
LINE 157: Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am
LINE 158: sure you will be very comfortable there.
LINE 159: "Yours, etc."
LINE 160: This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
LINE 161: considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
LINE 162: All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
LINE 163: even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every
LINE 164: review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
LINE 165: advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
LINE 166: Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
LINE 167: regret what he had thrown away.
LINE 168: Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
LINE 169: concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
LINE 170: such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
LINE 171: herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
LINE 172: he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
LINE 173: see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
LINE 174: Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
LINE 175: with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
LINE 176: permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
LINE 177: remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
LINE 178: agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
LINE 179: in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
LINE 180: Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
LINE 181: suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
LINE 182: ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
LINE 183: sincerely wish him happy.
LINE 184: All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the
LINE 185: circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
LINE 186: that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
LINE 187: pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
LINE 188: and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
LINE 189: towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
LINE 190: out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
LINE 191: her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
LINE 192: watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
LINE 193: interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
LINE 194: with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
LINE 195: Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
LINE 196: his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways
LINE 197: of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
LINE 198: handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
LINE 199: plain."
