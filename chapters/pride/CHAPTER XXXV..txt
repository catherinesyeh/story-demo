LINE 2: Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
LINE 3: which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
LINE 4: surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
LINE 5: else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
LINE 6: breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
LINE 7: directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
LINE 8: sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
LINE 9: she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The
LINE 10: park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
LINE 11: of the gates into the ground.
LINE 12: After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
LINE 13: tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
LINE 14: look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
LINE 15: made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
LINE 16: verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her
LINE 17: walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove
LINE 18: which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
LINE 19: Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was
LINE 20: now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
LINE 21: pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
LINE 22: though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again
LINE 23: towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
LINE 24: a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
LINE 25: composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
LINE 26: meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" and
LINE 27: then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
LINE 28: out of sight.
LINE 29: With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
LINE 30: Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
LINE 31: perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
LINE 32: quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
LINE 33: full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
LINE 34: from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
LINE 35: "Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
LINE 36: its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
LINE 37: offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
LINE 38: intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
LINE 39: which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
LINE 40: effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
LINE 41: should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
LINE 42: and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
LINE 43: your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
LINE 44: demand it of your justice.
LINE 45: "Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
LINE 46: magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
LINE 47: that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
LINE 48: from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
LINE 49: claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
LINE 50: prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
LINE 51: wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
LINE 52: favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
LINE 53: dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
LINE 54: its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
LINE 55: persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
LINE 56: bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
LINE 57: night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
LINE 58: to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
LINE 59: their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due
LINE 60: to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
LINE 61: offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must
LINE 62: be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in
LINE 63: Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley
LINE 64: preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But
LINE 65: it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any
LINE 66: apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him
LINE 67: in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with
LINE 68: you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental
LINE 69: information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to
LINE 70: a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain
LINE 71: event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I
LINE 72: observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive
LINE 73: that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed
LINE 74: in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,
LINE 75: cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
LINE 76: regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening's scrutiny, that
LINE 77: though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
LINE 78: them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken
LINE 79: here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your
LINE 80: sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled
LINE 81: by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
LINE 82: unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
LINE 83: your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most
LINE 84: acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
LINE 85: was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing
LINE 86: her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my
LINE 87: investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
LINE 88: fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I
LINE 89: believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.
LINE 90: My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night
LINE 91: acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
LINE 92: in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
LINE 93: my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes
LINE 94: which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
LINE 95: instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
LINE 96: immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The
LINE 97: situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in
LINE 98: comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
LINE 99: uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
LINE 100: occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend
LINE 101: you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
LINE 102: and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
LINE 103: consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
LINE 104: any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
LINE 105: you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
LINE 106: disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed
LINE 107: that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
LINE 108: inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my
LINE 109: friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left
LINE 110: Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,
LINE 111: remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is
LINE 112: now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited
LINE 113: with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
LINE 114: sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
LINE 115: shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly
LINE 116: went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
LINE 117: friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them
LINE 118: earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
LINE 119: his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have
LINE 120: prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
LINE 121: I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before
LINE 122: believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
LINE 123: regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
LINE 124: dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,
LINE 125: that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade
LINE 126: him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
LINE 127: given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for
LINE 128: having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
LINE 129: affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I
LINE 130: condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
LINE 131: your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss
LINE 132: Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might
LINE 133: have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
LINE 134: did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some
LINE 135: danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is
LINE 136: done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have
LINE 137: nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your
LINE 138: sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
LINE 139: governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not
LINE 140: yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty
LINE 141: accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by
LINE 142: laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he
LINE 143: has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I
LINE 144: shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
LINE 145: Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
LINE 146: the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
LINE 147: the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
LINE 148: to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
LINE 149: therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and
LINE 150: afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
LINE 151: always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
LINE 152: give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this
LINE 153: young man's society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the
LINE 154: highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
LINE 155: intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years
LINE 156: since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The
LINE 157: vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to
LINE 158: guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
LINE 159: observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
LINE 160: had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy
LINE 161: could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you
LINE 162: only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has
LINE 163: created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding
LINE 164: his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father
LINE 165: died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the
LINE 166: last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to
LINE 167: promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
LINE 168: allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
LINE 169: might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of
LINE 170: one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and
LINE 171: within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me
LINE 172: that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should
LINE 173: not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
LINE 174: pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
LINE 175: benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I
LINE 176: must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
LINE 177: insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be
LINE 178: sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
LINE 179: proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The
LINE 180: business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance
LINE 181: in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
LINE 182: receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
LINE 183: between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
LINE 184: to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he
LINE 185: chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being
LINE 186: now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and
LINE 187: dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the
LINE 188: decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
LINE 189: he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His
LINE 190: circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,
LINE 191: were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
LINE 192: and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present
LINE 193: him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little
LINE 194: doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,
LINE 195: and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will
LINE 196: hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
LINE 197: resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to
LINE 198: the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in
LINE 199: his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this
LINE 200: period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I
LINE 201: know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my
LINE 202: notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
LINE 203: myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me
LINE 204: to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of
LINE 205: your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
LINE 206: to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and
LINE 207: myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
LINE 208: establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with
LINE 209: the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.
LINE 210: Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior
LINE 211: acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were
LINE 212: most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far
LINE 213: recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
LINE 214: strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
LINE 215: persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She
LINE 216: was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
LINE 217: imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
LINE 218: herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
LINE 219: elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
LINE 220: and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
LINE 221: acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I
LINE 222: acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public
LINE 223: exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,
LINE 224: and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's
LINE 225: chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty
LINE 226: thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
LINE 227: himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been
LINE 228: complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
LINE 229: which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
LINE 230: reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
LINE 231: towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of
LINE 232: falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
LINE 233: wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
LINE 234: either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
LINE 235: not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not
LINE 236: told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know
LINE 237: what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here
LINE 238: related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel
LINE 239: Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
LINE 240: still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been
LINE 241: unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If
LINE 242: your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
LINE 243: cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
LINE 244: that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour
LINE 245: to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
LINE 246: course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.
LINE 247: "FITZWILLIAM DARCY."
