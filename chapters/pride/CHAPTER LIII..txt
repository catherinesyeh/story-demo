LINE 1: [Illustration]
LINE 2: Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
LINE 3: never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
LINE 4: by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
LINE 5: had said enough to keep him quiet.
LINE 6: The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was
LINE 7: forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
LINE 8: entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
LINE 9: continue at least a twelvemonth.
LINE 10: "Oh, my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"
LINE 11: "Oh, Lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."
LINE 12: "Write to me very often, my dear."
LINE 13: "As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
LINE 14: writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
LINE 15: do."
LINE 16: Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He
LINE 17: smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
LINE 18: "He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
LINE 19: the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
LINE 20: all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
LINE 21: himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."
LINE 22: The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
LINE 23: "I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
LINE 24: one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."
LINE 25: "This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said
LINE 26: Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
LINE 27: single."
LINE 28: "It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;
LINE 29: but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
LINE 30: that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."
LINE 31: But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
LINE 32: relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
LINE 33: article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
LINE 34: at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
LINE 35: master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
LINE 36: weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
LINE 37: smiled, and shook her head, by turns.
LINE 38: "Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.
LINE 39: Philips first brought her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that
LINE 40: I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I
LINE 41: never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to
LINE 42: Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that
LINE 43: is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
LINE 44: a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?"
LINE 45: "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nichols was in
LINE 46: Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
LINE 47: to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He
LINE 48: comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
LINE 49: going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
LINE 50: Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."
LINE 51: Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
LINE 52: colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
LINE 53: Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--
LINE 54: "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
LINE 55: report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don't imagine it was from
LINE 56: any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
LINE 57: I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
LINE 58: me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
LINE 59: alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
LINE 60: _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."
LINE 61: Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
LINE 62: Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
LINE 63: other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
LINE 64: to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
LINE 65: there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
LINE 66: without it.
LINE 67: "Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come
LINE 68: to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
LINE 69: speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."
LINE 70: In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
LINE 71: feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
LINE 72: perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
LINE 73: more unequal, than she had often seen them.
LINE 74: The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
LINE 75: about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
LINE 76: "As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you
LINE 77: will wait on him, of course."
LINE 78: "No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
LINE 79: went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
LINE 80: nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."
LINE 81: His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
LINE 82: would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
LINE 83: Netherfield.
LINE 84: "'Tis an _etiquette_ I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let
LINE 85: him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in
LINE 86: running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
LINE 87: again."
LINE 88: "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
LINE 89: on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I
LINE 90: am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
LINE 91: make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
LINE 92: him."
LINE 93: Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
LINE 94: husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
LINE 95: neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
LINE 96: _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--
LINE 97: "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It
LINE 98: would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can
LINE 99: hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
LINE 100: but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
LINE 101: says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
LINE 102: "I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it
LINE 103: is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
LINE 104: of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
LINE 105: always so much."
LINE 106: Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
LINE 107: contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
LINE 108: and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days
LINE 109: that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of
LINE 110: seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in
LINE 111: Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
LINE 112: paddock, and ride towards the house.
LINE 113: Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
LINE 114: kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
LINE 115: to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
LINE 116: again by her sister.
LINE 117: "There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"
LINE 118: "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
LINE 119: know."
LINE 120: "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
LINE 121: him before. Mr. what's his name--that tall, proud man."
LINE 122: "Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
LINE 123: Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
LINE 124: say that I hate the very sight of him."
LINE 125: Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
LINE 126: of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
LINE 127: which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
LINE 128: after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
LINE 129: enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
LINE 130: mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
LINE 131: civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
LINE 132: of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
LINE 133: suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.
LINE 134: Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
LINE 135: him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
LINE 136: and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
LINE 137: information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
LINE 138: for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
LINE 139: interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
LINE 140: what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
LINE 141: coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
LINE 142: was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
LINE 143: behaviour in Derbyshire.
LINE 144: The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
LINE 145: minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
LINE 146: her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
LINE 147: wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.
LINE 148: "Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
LINE 149: enough for expectation."
LINE 150: She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
LINE 151: lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
LINE 152: sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
LINE 153: paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
LINE 154: gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
LINE 155: tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
LINE 156: symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.
LINE 157: Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
LINE 158: again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
LINE 159: had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,
LINE 160: she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
LINE 161: she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her
LINE 162: mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a
LINE 163: painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
LINE 164: Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
LINE 165: saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
LINE 166: Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
LINE 167: especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
LINE 168: her courtesy and address of his friend.
LINE 169: Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
LINE 170: preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
LINE 171: hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
LINE 172: applied.
LINE 173: Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question
LINE 174: which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He
LINE 175: was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
LINE 176: it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends
LINE 177: when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without
LINE 178: bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
LINE 179: the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
LINE 180: found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
LINE 181: the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
LINE 182: they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
LINE 183: with herself for being so.
LINE 184: "Could I expect it to be otherwise?" said she. "Yet why did he come?"
LINE 185: She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
LINE 186: him she had hardly courage to speak.
LINE 187: She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
LINE 188: "It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.
LINE 189: He readily agreed to it.
LINE 190: "I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,
LINE 191: you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
LINE 192: it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
LINE 193: since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my
LINE 194: own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
LINE 195: seen it in the papers. It was in the 'Times' and the 'Courier,' I know;
LINE 196: though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,
LINE 197: George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
LINE 198: syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
LINE 199: It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came
LINE 200: to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"
LINE 201: Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
LINE 202: dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
LINE 203: not tell.
LINE 204: "It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
LINE 205: continued her mother; "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
LINE 206: hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a
LINE 207: place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not
LINE 208: know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of
LINE 209: his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.
LINE 210: Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
LINE 211: deserves."
LINE 212: Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery
LINE 213: of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,
LINE 214: the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
LINE 215: before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the
LINE 216: country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
LINE 217: "When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother,
LINE 218: "I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
LINE 219: Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
LINE 220: will save all the best of the coveys for you."
LINE 221: Elizabeth's misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
LINE 222: attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
LINE 223: flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
LINE 224: hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,
LINE 225: that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
LINE 226: moments of such painful confusion.
LINE 227: "The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be
LINE 228: in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
LINE 229: that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
LINE 230: one or the other again!"
LINE 231: Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
LINE 232: compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
LINE 233: how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
LINE 234: lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every
LINE 235: five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her
LINE 236: as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
LINE 237: unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
LINE 238: difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
LINE 239: that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
LINE 240: that she did not always know when she was silent.
LINE 241: When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
LINE 242: intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
LINE 243: Longbourn in a few days' time.
LINE 244: "You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added; "for when
LINE 245: you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
LINE 246: us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you
LINE 247: I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
LINE 248: engagement."
LINE 249: Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
LINE 250: his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
LINE 251: Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
LINE 252: there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
LINE 253: not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
LINE 254: on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
LINE 255: of one who had ten thousand a year.
