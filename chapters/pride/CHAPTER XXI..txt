LINE 2: The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
LINE 3: Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
LINE 4: attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
LINE 5: As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
LINE 6: by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
LINE 7: stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to
LINE 8: her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
LINE 9: himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
LINE 10: civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
LINE 11: especially to her friend.
LINE 12: The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill
LINE 13: health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
LINE 14: had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
LINE 15: not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
LINE 16: Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.
LINE 17: After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham
LINE 18: were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
LINE 19: He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
LINE 20: aunt's, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
LINE 21: well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
LINE 22: that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
LINE 23: "I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
LINE 24: Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
LINE 25: many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
LINE 26: might arise unpleasant to more than myself."
LINE 27: She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full
LINE 28: discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
LINE 29: bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
LINE 30: them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.
LINE 31: His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the
LINE 32: compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
LINE 33: occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
LINE 34: [Illustration: "Walked back with them"

LINE 36: Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
LINE 37: from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a
LINE 38: sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
LINE 39: fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as
LINE 40: she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
LINE 41: Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
LINE 42: join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
LINE 43: Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
LINE 44: even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
LINE 45: than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they
LINE 46: had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, "This is
LINE 47: from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.
LINE 48: The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way
LINE 49: to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear
LINE 50: what she says."
LINE 51: She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
LINE 52: of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
LINE 53: and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.
LINE 54: Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--"'I do not pretend to
LINE 55: regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my
LINE 56: dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
LINE 57: returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
LINE 58: meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
LINE 59: unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.'" To these
LINE 60: high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
LINE 61: distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
LINE 62: saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
LINE 63: absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
LINE 64: to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
LINE 65: cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.
LINE 66: "It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
LINE 67: able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
LINE 68: hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks
LINE 69: forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
LINE 70: intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
LINE 71: satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
LINE 72: them."
LINE 73: "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
LINE 74: Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.
LINE 75: "'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
LINE 76: took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
LINE 77: are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
LINE 78: Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
LINE 79: determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
LINE 80: his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are
LINE 81: already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
LINE 82: friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I
LINE 83: despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
LINE 84: the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
LINE 85: will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
LINE 86: whom we shall deprive you.'
LINE 87: "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
LINE 88: winter."
LINE 89: "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."
LINE 90: "Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.
LINE 91: But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
LINE 92: particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. 'Mr. Darcy is
LINE 93: impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
LINE 94: less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has
LINE 95: her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
LINE 96: she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still
LINE 97: more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
LINE 98: hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to
LINE 99: you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country
LINE 100: without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
LINE 101: unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
LINE 102: frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
LINE 103: relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
LINE 104: partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
LINE 105: capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
LINE 106: favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
LINE 107: Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
LINE 108: of so many?' What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said
LINE 109: Jane, as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly
LINE 110: declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;
LINE 111: that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that
LINE 112: if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most
LINE 113: kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the
LINE 114: subject?"
LINE 115: "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"
LINE 116: "Most willingly."
LINE 117: "You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
LINE 118: in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to
LINE 119: town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
LINE 120: does not care about you."
LINE 121: Jane shook her head.
LINE 122: "Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
LINE 123: together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she
LINE 124: is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
LINE 125: Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
LINE 126: case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
LINE 127: is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
LINE 128: that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
LINE 129: in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
LINE 130: dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my
LINE 131: dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley
LINE 132: tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
LINE 133: degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
LINE 134: Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
LINE 135: of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
LINE 136: "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
LINE 137: representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
LINE 138: foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
LINE 139: anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
LINE 140: herself."
LINE 141: "That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
LINE 142: will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
LINE 143: You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
LINE 144: "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
LINE 145: accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
LINE 146: elsewhere?"
LINE 147: "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon mature
LINE 148: deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
LINE 149: more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,
LINE 150: by all means, to refuse him."
LINE 151: "How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling; "you must know, that,
LINE 152: though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
LINE 153: not hesitate."
LINE 154: "I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
LINE 155: your situation with much compassion."
LINE 156: "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
LINE 157: required. A thousand things may arise in six months."
LINE 158: The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
LINE 159: contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
LINE 160: interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those
LINE 161: wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
LINE 162: so totally independent of everyone.
LINE 163: She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
LINE 164: the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
LINE 165: Jane's temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
LINE 166: though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
LINE 167: Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.
LINE 168: They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
LINE 169: family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
LINE 170: but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
LINE 171: and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
LINE 172: to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
LINE 173: lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
LINE 174: thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
LINE 175: Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
LINE 176: that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
LINE 177: care to have two full courses.
