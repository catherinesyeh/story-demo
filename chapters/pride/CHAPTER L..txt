LINE 2: Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
LINE 3: instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
LINE 4: the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
LINE 5: him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
LINE 6: respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
LINE 7: honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
LINE 8: prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to
LINE 9: be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
LINE 10: He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
LINE 11: should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
LINE 12: was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
LINE 13: and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
LINE 14: When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
LINE 15: useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join
LINE 16: in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
LINE 17: and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
LINE 18: successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
LINE 19: Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
LINE 20: would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
LINE 21: late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her
LINE 22: husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
LINE 23: income.
LINE 24: Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
LINE 25: the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
LINE 26: latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
LINE 27: regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
LINE 28: could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
LINE 29: terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
LINE 30: expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
LINE 31: approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
LINE 32: engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
LINE 33: that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
LINE 34: done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
LINE 35: arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the
LINE 36: hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
LINE 37: allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
LINE 38: through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within
LINE 39: that sum.
LINE 40: That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
LINE 41: another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
LINE 42: as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
LINE 43: of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
LINE 44: naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
LINE 45: despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
LINE 46: its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was
LINE 47: indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any
LINE 48: message to her.
LINE 49: The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
LINE 50: speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
LINE 51: philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
LINE 52: conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
LINE 53: happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
LINE 54: farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
LINE 55: good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
LINE 56: all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit
LINE 57: in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery
LINE 58: was considered certain.
LINE 59: It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this
LINE 60: happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
LINE 61: spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
LINE 62: triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
LINE 63: her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
LINE 64: accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
LINE 65: attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
LINE 66: servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
LINE 67: proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
LINE 68: what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
LINE 69: importance.
LINE 70: "Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the
LINE 71: great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
LINE 72: too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
LINE 73: Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."
LINE 74: Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
LINE 75: servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.
LINE 76: Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
LINE 77: daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
LINE 78: neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
LINE 79: imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."
LINE 80: A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it
LINE 81: soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
LINE 82: that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
LINE 83: daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
LINE 84: affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
LINE 85: it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
LINE 86: resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
LINE 87: marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
LINE 88: possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new
LINE 89: clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
LINE 90: shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
LINE 91: took place.
LINE 92: Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
LINE 93: the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
LINE 94: her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
LINE 95: termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
LINE 96: unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
LINE 97: spot.
LINE 98: She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were
LINE 99: few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
LINE 100: but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
LINE 101: frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of
LINE 102: disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
LINE 103: seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
LINE 104: concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
LINE 105: Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
LINE 106: objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
LINE 107: kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.
LINE 108: From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The
LINE 109: wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
LINE 110: feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
LINE 111: blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
LINE 112: hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
LINE 113: longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
LINE 114: seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
LINE 115: she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
LINE 116: should meet.
LINE 117: What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
LINE 118: proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
LINE 119: have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
LINE 120: doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,
LINE 121: there must be a triumph.
LINE 122: She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
LINE 123: disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
LINE 124: temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
LINE 125: was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
LINE 126: and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
LINE 127: and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
LINE 128: have received benefit of greater importance.
LINE 129: But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
LINE 130: connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
LINE 131: precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
LINE 132: family.
LINE 133: How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
LINE 134: could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to
LINE 135: a couple who were only brought together because their passions were
LINE 136: stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
LINE 137: Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
LINE 138: acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
LINE 139: promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
LINE 140: that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
LINE 141: purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved
LINE 142: on quitting the militia.
LINE 143: "It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his
LINE 144: marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
LINE 145: considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
LINE 146: account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the
LINE 147: Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
LINE 148: able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
LINE 149: ensigncy in General----'s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is
LINE 150: an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
LINE 151: promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
LINE 152: have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
LINE 153: written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
LINE 154: and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
LINE 155: in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have
LINE 156: pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
LINE 157: similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
LINE 158: a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
LINE 159: hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and
LINE 160: all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
LINE 161: unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
LINE 162: Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
LINE 163: leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
LINE 164: you and her mother.--Yours, etc.
LINE 165: "E. GARDINER."
LINE 166: Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's
LINE 167: removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But
LINE 168: Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in
LINE 169: the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
LINE 170: company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
LINE 171: Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
LINE 172: pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
LINE 173: with everybody, and had so many favourites.
LINE 174: "She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
LINE 175: to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
LINE 176: likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----'s
LINE 177: regiment."
LINE 178: His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
LINE 179: admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
LINE 180: received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who
LINE 181: agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
LINE 182: consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
LINE 183: urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
LINE 184: and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
LINE 185: prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
LINE 186: mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
LINE 187: her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
LINE 188: the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
LINE 189: sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
LINE 190: as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth
LINE 191: was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;
LINE 192: and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
LINE 193: would have been the last object of her wishes.
