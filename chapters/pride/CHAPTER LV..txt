LINE 2: A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
LINE 3: friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
LINE 4: ten days' time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
LINE 5: good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
LINE 6: expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
LINE 7: "Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."
LINE 8: He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
LINE 9: would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
LINE 10: them.
LINE 11: "Can you come to-morrow?"
LINE 12: Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
LINE 13: accepted with alacrity.
LINE 14: He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
LINE 15: dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters' room, in her
LINE 16: dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--
LINE 17: "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
LINE 18: come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
LINE 19: Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
LINE 20: Lizzy's hair."
LINE 21: "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
LINE 22: forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago."
LINE 23: "Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!
LINE 24: where is your sash, my dear?"
LINE 25: But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
LINE 26: without one of her sisters.
LINE 27: The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
LINE 28: evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
LINE 29: custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the
LINE 30: five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
LINE 31: Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
LINE 32: impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
LINE 33: Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter, mamma? What do
LINE 34: you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"
LINE 35: "Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still
LINE 36: five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
LINE 37: suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--
LINE 38: "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.
LINE 39: Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
LINE 40: premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a
LINE 41: few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--
LINE 42: "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
LINE 43: Elizabeth was forced to go.
LINE 44: "We may as well leave them by themselves, you know," said her mother as
LINE 45: soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in
LINE 46: my dressing-room."
LINE 47: Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
LINE 48: quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
LINE 49: into the drawing-room.
LINE 50: Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
LINE 51: everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
LINE 52: daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
LINE 53: addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
LINE 54: officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
LINE 55: forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
LINE 56: daughter.
LINE 57: He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away
LINE 58: an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's
LINE 59: means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
LINE 60: After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
LINE 61: between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the
LINE 62: happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
LINE 63: returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
LINE 64: persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
LINE 65: concurrence.
LINE 66: Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the
LINE 67: morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
LINE 68: agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
LINE 69: or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
LINE 70: silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
LINE 71: other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
LINE 72: and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
LINE 73: everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to
LINE 74: write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
LINE 75: as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
LINE 76: wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
LINE 77: But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
LINE 78: she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
LINE 79: mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she
LINE 80: perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as
LINE 81: if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
LINE 82: the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
LINE 83: other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but
LINE 84: _hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by
LINE 85: either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
LINE 86: Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
LINE 87: whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
LINE 88: Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
LINE 89: pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
LINE 90: emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
LINE 91: "'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,
LINE 92: why is not everybody as happy?"
LINE 93: Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
LINE 94: delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
LINE 95: kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
LINE 96: allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
LINE 97: said, for the present.
LINE 98: "I must go instantly to my mother," she cried. "I would not on any
LINE 99: account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
LINE 100: from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to
LINE 101: know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
LINE 102: family! how shall I bear so much happiness?"
LINE 103: She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
LINE 104: card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.
LINE 105: Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
LINE 106: with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
LINE 107: previous months of suspense and vexation.
LINE 108: "And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
LINE 109: circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
LINE 110: happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!"
LINE 111: In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
LINE 112: father had been short and to the purpose.
LINE 113: "Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.
LINE 114: "With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."
LINE 115: He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
LINE 116: and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
LINE 117: delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
LINE 118: great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
LINE 119: to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
LINE 120: and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
LINE 121: expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
LINE 122: basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
LINE 123: Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
LINE 124: himself.
LINE 125: It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
LINE 126: Miss Bennet's mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as
LINE 127: made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
LINE 128: her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or
LINE 129: speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
LINE 130: though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
LINE 131: Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
LINE 132: how really happy he was.
LINE 133: Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
LINE 134: visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
LINE 135: turned to his daughter and said,--
LINE 136: "Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."
LINE 137: Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
LINE 138: goodness.
LINE 139: "You are a good girl," he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
LINE 140: thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
LINE 141: doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
LINE 142: each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
LINE 143: easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
LINE 144: always exceed your income."
LINE 145: "I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
LINE 146: unpardonable in _me_."
LINE 147: "Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
LINE 148: talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
LINE 149: more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so
LINE 150: happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
LINE 151: would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
LINE 152: be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
LINE 153: he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
LINE 154: that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that
LINE 155: ever was seen!"
LINE 156: Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
LINE 157: favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger
LINE 158: sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
LINE 159: which she might in future be able to dispense.
LINE 160: Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
LINE 161: begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
LINE 162: Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
LINE 163: coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
LINE 164: supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
LINE 165: detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
LINE 166: himself obliged to accept.
LINE 167: Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
LINE 168: while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but
LINE 169: she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
LINE 170: separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always
LINE 171: attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
LINE 172: when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
LINE 173: "He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he
LINE 174: was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
LINE 175: it possible."
LINE 176: "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for
LINE 177: it?"
LINE 178: "It must have been his sisters' doing. They were certainly no friends to
LINE 179: his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
LINE 180: chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
LINE 181: as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
LINE 182: learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
LINE 183: can never be what we once were to each other."
LINE 184: "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
LINE 185: heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
LINE 186: the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."
LINE 187: "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he
LINE 188: really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent
LINE 189: would have prevented his coming down again?"
LINE 190: "He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
LINE 191: modesty."
LINE 192: This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
LINE 193: the little value he put on his own good qualities.
LINE 194: Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference
LINE 195: of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving
LINE 196: heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
LINE 197: her against him.
LINE 198: "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
LINE 199: Jane. "Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
LINE 200: above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such
LINE 201: another man for you!"
LINE 202: "If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.
LINE 203: Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
LINE 204: happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
LINE 205: good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."
LINE 206: The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
LINE 207: secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and
LINE 208: she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
LINE 209: neighbours in Meryton.
LINE 210: The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
LINE 211: world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
LINE 212: they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
