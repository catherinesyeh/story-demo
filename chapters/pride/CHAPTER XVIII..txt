LINE 1: Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in
LINE 2: vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
LINE 3: doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
LINE 4: meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
LINE 5: might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
LINE 6: usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
LINE 7: that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
LINE 8: might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
LINE 9: dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
LINE 10: pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
LINE 11: was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
LINE 12: pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
LINE 13: who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
LINE 14: the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
LINE 15: smile,
LINE 16: "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
LINE 17: he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."
LINE 18: This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
LINE 19: Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
LINE 20: Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
LINE 21: of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
LINE 22: disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
LINE 23: the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to
LINE 24: make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to
LINE 25: Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and
LINE 26: turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly
LINE 27: surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality
LINE 28: provoked her.
LINE 29: But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
LINE 30: of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
LINE 31: spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
LINE 32: not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to
LINE 33: the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
LINE 34: notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress;
LINE 35: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
LINE 36: apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
LINE 37: aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
LINE 38: partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
LINE 39: him was ecstacy.
LINE 40: She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
LINE 41: Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
LINE 42: were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
LINE 43: her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
LINE 44: her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
LINE 45: knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
LINE 46: immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
LINE 47: mind; Charlotte tried to console her.
LINE 48: "I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
LINE 49: "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To
LINE 50: find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me
LINE 51: such an evil."
LINE 52: When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
LINE 53: hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a
LINE 54: simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
LINE 55: in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
LINE 56: answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
LINE 57: she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
LINE 58: reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
LINE 59: They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
LINE 60: imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
LINE 61: first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
LINE 62: be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
LINE 63: some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent.
LINE 64: After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with
LINE 65: "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about
LINE 66: the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of
LINE 67: the room, or the number of couples."
LINE 68: He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
LINE 69: said.
LINE 70: "Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I
LINE 71: may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
LINE 72: ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."
LINE 73: "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"
LINE 74: "Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
LINE 75: entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of
LINE 76: _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
LINE 77: trouble of saying as little as possible."
LINE 78: "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
LINE 79: imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
LINE 80: "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
LINE 81: similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial,
LINE 82: taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
LINE 83: something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
LINE 84: posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
LINE 85: "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
LINE 86: said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_
LINE 87: think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."
LINE 88: "I must not decide on my own performance."
LINE 89: He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
LINE 90: the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
LINE 91: walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
LINE 92: the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
LINE 93: been forming a new acquaintance."
LINE 94: The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
LINE 95: features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
LINE 96: for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
LINE 97: constrained manner said,
LINE 98: "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his
LINE 99: _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
LINE 100: is less certain."
LINE 101: "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
LINE 102: with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
LINE 103: his life."
LINE 104: Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
LINE 105: that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
LINE 106: through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
LINE 107: Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his
LINE 108: dancing and his partner.
LINE 109: "I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very
LINE 110: superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
LINE 111: first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
LINE 112: disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
LINE 113: especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing
LINE 114: at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place. What congratulations will
LINE 115: then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you,
LINE 116: Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching
LINE 117: converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
LINE 118: The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
LINE 119: William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
LINE 120: eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
LINE 121: Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
LINE 122: he turned to his partner, and said,
LINE 123: "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."
LINE 124: "I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
LINE 125: interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
LINE 126: themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without
LINE 127: success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
LINE 128: "What think you of books?" said he, smiling.
LINE 129: "Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
LINE 130: feelings."
LINE 131: "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
LINE 132: no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."
LINE 133: "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
LINE 134: something else."
LINE 135: "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
LINE 136: with a look of doubt.
LINE 137: "Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
LINE 138: thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
LINE 139: by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
LINE 140: that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
LINE 141: unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
LINE 142: created_."
LINE 143: "I am," said he, with a firm voice.
LINE 144: "And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
LINE 145: "I hope not."
LINE 146: "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
LINE 147: to be secure of judging properly at first."
LINE 148: "May I ask to what these questions tend?"
LINE 149: "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
LINE 150: to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."
LINE 151: "And what is your success?"
LINE 152: She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different
LINE 153: accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."
LINE 154: "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary
LINE 155: greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
LINE 156: not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
LINE 157: fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
LINE 158: "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
LINE 159: opportunity."
LINE 160: "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.
LINE 161: She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
LINE 162: silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for
LINE 163: in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her,
LINE 164: which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
LINE 165: another.
LINE 166: They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with
LINE 167: an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,
LINE 168: "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
LINE 169: Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
LINE 170: thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you,
LINE 171: among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the
LINE 172: late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend,
LINE 173: not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr.
LINE 174: Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he
LINE 175: has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has
LINE 176: treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
LINE 177: particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
LINE 178: blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that
LINE 179: though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his
LINE 180: invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had
LINE 181: taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a
LINE 182: most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.
LINE 183: I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt;
LINE 184: but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."
LINE 185: "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
LINE 186: Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
LINE 187: than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
LINE 188: assure you, he informed me himself."
LINE 189: "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
LINE 190: "Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant."
LINE 191: "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if
LINE 192: you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
LINE 193: nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
LINE 194: Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
LINE 195: inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
LINE 196: such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
LINE 197: marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the
LINE 198: evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment
LINE 199: solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing
LINE 200: else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for
LINE 201: happiness.
LINE 202: "I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
LINE 203: sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
LINE 204: been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
LINE 205: you may be sure of my pardon."
LINE 206: "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
LINE 207: satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
LINE 208: history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
LINE 209: principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
LINE 210: the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
LINE 211: Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
LINE 212: received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his
LINE 213: sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am
LINE 214: afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's
LINE 215: regard."
LINE 216: "Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"
LINE 217: "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
LINE 218: "This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
LINE 219: perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"
LINE 220: "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
LINE 221: them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
LINE 222: him _conditionally_ only."
LINE 223: "I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
LINE 224: "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
LINE 225: Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but
LINE 226: since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
LINE 227: the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
LINE 228: both gentlemen as I did before."
LINE 229: She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
LINE 230: which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
LINE 231: delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
LINE 232: Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
LINE 233: in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
LINE 234: to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
LINE 235: partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and
LINE 236: told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to
LINE 237: make a most important discovery.
LINE 238: "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
LINE 239: in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
LINE 240: gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
LINE 241: this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother
LINE 242: Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
LINE 243: have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
LINE 244: Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made
LINE 245: in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
LINE 246: and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
LINE 247: ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."
LINE 248: "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?"
LINE 249: "Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
LINE 250: I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
LINE 251: assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night."
LINE 252: Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
LINE 253: that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
LINE 254: an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
LINE 255: was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
LINE 256: side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
LINE 257: consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her
LINE 258: with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she
LINE 259: ceased speaking, replied thus,
LINE 260: "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
LINE 261: excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
LINE 262: understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
LINE 263: between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
LINE 264: which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider
LINE 265: the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
LINE 266: in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
LINE 267: same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates
LINE 268: of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look
LINE 269: on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your
LINE 270: advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though
LINE 271: in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and
LINE 272: habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
LINE 273: yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
LINE 274: reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
LINE 275: being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
LINE 276: a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
LINE 277: hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
LINE 278: "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him
LINE 279: expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained
LINE 280: wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied
LINE 281: with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not
LINE 282: discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
LINE 283: abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
LINE 284: end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
LINE 285: Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
LINE 286: "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
LINE 287: reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
LINE 288: me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
LINE 289: that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
LINE 290: certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
LINE 291: handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
LINE 292: As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
LINE 293: her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the
LINE 294: train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
LINE 295: made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
LINE 296: that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
LINE 297: could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of
LINE 298: endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
LINE 299: she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
LINE 300: venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
LINE 301: supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
LINE 302: placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
LINE 303: that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
LINE 304: openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be
LINE 305: soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.
LINE 306: Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of
LINE 307: the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
LINE 308: but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation;
LINE 309: and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
LINE 310: Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
LINE 311: she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
LINE 312: daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
LINE 313: other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
LINE 314: able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
LINE 315: she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
LINE 316: necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
LINE 317: such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
LINE 318: Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She
LINE 319: concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
LINE 320: fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
LINE 321: chance of it.
LINE 322: In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
LINE 323: words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
LINE 324: whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
LINE 325: chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
LINE 326: mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
LINE 327: "What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
LINE 328: sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
LINE 329: nothing _he_ may not like to hear."
LINE 330: "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you
LINE 331: to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
LINE 332: so doing."
LINE 333: Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother
LINE 334: would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed
LINE 335: and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
LINE 336: glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
LINE 337: she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
LINE 338: convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
LINE 339: of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
LINE 340: steady gravity.
LINE 341: At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
LINE 342: had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
LINE 343: likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
LINE 344: Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
LINE 345: tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
LINE 346: had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
LINE 347: preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
LINE 348: entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
LINE 349: complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
LINE 350: opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
LINE 351: Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she
LINE 352: watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
LINE 353: which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
LINE 354: amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be
LINE 355: prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
LINE 356: began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
LINE 357: her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.
LINE 358: She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
LINE 359: talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
LINE 360: signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however
LINE 361: impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
LINE 362: interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
LINE 363: and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,
LINE 364: "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
LINE 365: Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."
LINE 366: Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
LINE 367: Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
LINE 368: her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.
LINE 369: "If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
LINE 370: should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
LINE 371: air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
LINE 372: compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to
LINE 373: assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
LINE 374: music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
LINE 375: rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make
LINE 376: such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not
LINE 377: offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
LINE 378: that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
LINE 379: and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
LINE 380: as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
LINE 381: that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every
LINE 382: body, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot
LINE 383: acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should
LINE 384: omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected
LINE 385: with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,
LINE 386: which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many
LINE 387: stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet
LINE 388: himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having
LINE 389: spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that
LINE 390: he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
LINE 391: To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
LINE 392: expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
LINE 393: have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
LINE 394: finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
LINE 395: that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
LINE 396: feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
LINE 397: must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
LINE 398: have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and
LINE 399: she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
LINE 400: the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
LINE 401: The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teazed by
LINE 402: Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he
LINE 403: could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
LINE 404: power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
LINE 405: somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
LINE 406: He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
LINE 407: that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
LINE 408: her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
LINE 409: the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
LINE 410: her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
LINE 411: good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.
LINE 412: She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice;
LINE 413: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
LINE 414: disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
LINE 415: probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
LINE 416: it.
LINE 417: The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
LINE 418: manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of
LINE 419: an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how
LINE 420: heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
LINE 421: sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
LINE 422: were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
LINE 423: every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a
LINE 424: languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
LINE 425: long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
LINE 426: sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
LINE 427: politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
LINE 428: nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
LINE 429: Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
LINE 430: rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
LINE 431: silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
LINE 432: much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
LINE 433: how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.
LINE 434: When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
LINE 435: civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
LINE 436: addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
LINE 437: he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
LINE 438: without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful
LINE 439: pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
LINE 440: waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
LINE 441: go the next day for a short time.
LINE 442: Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
LINE 443: delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
LINE 444: settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
LINE 445: see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four
LINE 446: months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
LINE 447: with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
LINE 448: Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
LINE 449: man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
LINE 450: was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
