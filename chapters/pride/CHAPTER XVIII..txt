LINE 2: Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
LINE 3: vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
LINE 4: doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of
LINE 5: meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
LINE 6: might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
LINE 7: usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
LINE 8: that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
LINE 9: might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
LINE 10: dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy's
LINE 11: pleasure, in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this
LINE 12: was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
LINE 13: pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
LINE 14: who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
LINE 15: the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
LINE 16: smile,--
LINE 17: "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
LINE 18: he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."
LINE 19: This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
LINE 20: Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
LINE 21: Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
LINE 22: of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
LINE 23: disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
LINE 24: the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
LINE 25: Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
LINE 26: was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
LINE 27: with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
LINE 28: speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
LINE 29: But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
LINE 30: of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
LINE 31: spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she
LINE 32: had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary
LINE 33: transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
LINE 34: particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of
LINE 35: distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and
LINE 36: solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
LINE 37: without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
LINE 38: disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her
LINE 39: release from him was ecstasy.
LINE 40: She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
LINE 41: Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
LINE 42: were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
LINE 43: her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
LINE 44: her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
LINE 45: knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
LINE 46: immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
LINE 47: mind: Charlotte tried to console her.
LINE 48: "I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
LINE 49: "Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
LINE 50: a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
LINE 51: evil."
LINE 52: When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
LINE 53: hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a
LINE 54: simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
LINE 55: in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
LINE 56: answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
LINE 57: she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
LINE 58: reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
LINE 59: They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
LINE 60: imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
LINE 61: first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
LINE 62: would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
LINE 63: she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
LINE 64: silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,
LINE 65: with--
LINE 66: "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the
LINE 67: dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
LINE 68: room, or the number of couples."
LINE 69: He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
LINE 70: said.
LINE 71: "Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I
LINE 72: may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
LINE 73: _now_ we may be silent."
LINE 74: "Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"
LINE 75: "Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
LINE 76: entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
LINE 77: _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
LINE 78: trouble of saying as little as possible."
LINE 79: "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
LINE 80: imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
LINE 81: "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
LINE 82: similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
LINE 83: taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
LINE 84: something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
LINE 85: posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb."
LINE 86: "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
LINE 87: said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
LINE 88: think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly."
LINE 89: "I must not decide on my own performance."
LINE 90: He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
LINE 91: the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
LINE 92: walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
LINE 93: the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
LINE 94: been forming a new acquaintance."
LINE 95: The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
LINE 96: features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
LINE 97: for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
LINE 98: constrained manner said,--
LINE 99: "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
LINE 100: _making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
LINE 101: is less certain."
LINE 102: "He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied Elizabeth,
LINE 103: with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
LINE 104: his life."
LINE 105: Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
LINE 106: that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
LINE 107: through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.
LINE 108: Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
LINE 109: his dancing and his partner.
LINE 110: "I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
LINE 111: superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
LINE 112: first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
LINE 113: disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
LINE 114: especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing
LINE 115: at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will
LINE 116: then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
LINE 117: You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
LINE 118: that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
LINE 119: [Illustration:
LINE 120: "Such very superior dancing is not
LINE 121: often seen."
LINE 122: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
LINE 123: The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
LINE 124: William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
LINE 125: eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and
LINE 126: Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
LINE 127: he turned to his partner, and said,--
LINE 128: "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking
LINE 129: of."
LINE 130: "I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
LINE 131: interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
LINE 132: themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,
LINE 133: and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
LINE 134: "What think you of books?" said he, smiling.
LINE 135: "Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
LINE 136: feelings."
LINE 137: "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
LINE 138: no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions."
LINE 139: "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
LINE 140: something else."
LINE 141: "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
LINE 142: with a look of doubt.
LINE 143: "Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
LINE 144: thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
LINE 145: by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
LINE 146: that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
LINE 147: unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
LINE 148: created_?"
LINE 149: "I am," said he, with a firm voice.
LINE 150: "And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
LINE 151: "I hope not."
LINE 152: "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
LINE 153: to be secure of judging properly at first."
LINE 154: "May I ask to what these questions tend?"
LINE 155: "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
LINE 156: to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."
LINE 157: "And what is your success?"
LINE 158: She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different
LINE 159: accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."
LINE 160: "I can readily believe," answered he, gravely, "that reports may vary
LINE 161: greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
LINE 162: not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
LINE 163: fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
LINE 164: "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
LINE 165: opportunity."
LINE 166: "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.
LINE 167: She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
LINE 168: silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
LINE 169: in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
LINE 170: which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
LINE 171: another.
LINE 172: They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,
LINE 173: with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--
LINE 174: "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?
LINE 175: Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
LINE 176: questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
LINE 177: other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.
LINE 178: Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
LINE 179: implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy's using
LINE 180: him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always
LINE 181: remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a
LINE 182: most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very
LINE 183: well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear
LINE 184: to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
LINE 185: could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
LINE 186: was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.
LINE 187: His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and
LINE 188: I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this
LINE 189: discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his
LINE 190: descent, one could not expect much better."
LINE 191: "His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,"
LINE 192: said Elizabeth, angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing
LINE 193: worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
LINE 194: assure you, he informed me himself."
LINE 195: "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
LINE 196: "Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant."
LINE 197: "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if
LINE 198: you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
LINE 199: nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
LINE 200: Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
LINE 201: inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
LINE 202: such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
LINE 203: marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
LINE 204: Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
LINE 205: for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
LINE 206: way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.
LINE 207: "I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
LINE 208: sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
LINE 209: been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
LINE 210: you may be sure of my pardon."
LINE 211: "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
LINE 212: satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
LINE 213: history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
LINE 214: principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
LINE 215: the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
LINE 216: Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
LINE 217: received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
LINE 218: sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am
LINE 219: afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's
LINE 220: regard."
LINE 221: "Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself."
LINE 222: "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
LINE 223: "This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
LINE 224: perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"
LINE 225: "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
LINE 226: them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
LINE 227: him _conditionally_ only."
LINE 228: "I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly,
LINE 229: "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
LINE 230: Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
LINE 231: since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
LINE 232: the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
LINE 233: both gentlemen as I did before."
LINE 234: She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
LINE 235: which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
LINE 236: delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
LINE 237: Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
LINE 238: in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
LINE 239: to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
LINE 240: partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
LINE 241: and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate
LINE 242: as to make a most important discovery.
LINE 243: "I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
LINE 244: in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the
LINE 245: gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
LINE 246: this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,
LINE 247: Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would
LINE 248: have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
LINE 249: Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
LINE 250: in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
LINE 251: and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
LINE 252: ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."
LINE 253: "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?"
LINE 254: "Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
LINE 255: I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
LINE 256: assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."
LINE 257: Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
LINE 258: that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
LINE 259: an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
LINE 260: was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
LINE 261: side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
LINE 262: consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with
LINE 263: the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
LINE 264: speaking, replied thus,--
LINE 265: "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
LINE 266: excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
LINE 267: understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
LINE 268: between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
LINE 269: which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider
LINE 270: the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
LINE 271: in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
LINE 272: same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the
LINE 273: dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform
LINE 274: what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
LINE 275: your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
LINE 276: though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education
LINE 277: and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
LINE 278: yourself;" and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
LINE 279: reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
LINE 280: being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with
LINE 281: a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
LINE 282: hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology,"
LINE 283: "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed her to see him
LINE 284: expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with
LINE 285: unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,
LINE 286: replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not
LINE 287: discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
LINE 288: abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
LINE 289: end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.
LINE 290: Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
LINE 291: "I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
LINE 292: reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
LINE 293: me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
LINE 294: that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
LINE 295: certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
LINE 296: handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
LINE 297: As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
LINE 298: her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
LINE 299: train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
LINE 300: her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that
LINE 301: very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
LINE 302: bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
LINE 303: even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly
LINE 304: saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
LINE 305: lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,
LINE 306: she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
LINE 307: one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
LINE 308: talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
LINE 309: else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.
LINE 310: Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable
LINE 311: of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such
LINE 312: a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
LINE 313: were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
LINE 314: comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be
LINE 315: certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It
LINE 316: was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
LINE 317: Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
LINE 318: and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
LINE 319: consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
LINE 320: not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary
LINE 321: to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such
LINE 322: occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
LINE 323: Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She
LINE 324: concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
LINE 325: fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
LINE 326: chance of it.
LINE 327: In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
LINE 328: words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
LINE 329: whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
LINE 330: chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
LINE 331: mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
LINE 332: "What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
LINE 333: sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
LINE 334: nothing _he_ may not like to hear."
LINE 335: "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you
LINE 336: to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
LINE 337: so doing."
LINE 338: Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
LINE 339: talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
LINE 340: blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
LINE 341: glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
LINE 342: she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
LINE 343: convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
LINE 344: of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
LINE 345: steady gravity.
LINE 346: At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
LINE 347: had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
LINE 348: likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
LINE 349: Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
LINE 350: tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
LINE 351: had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
LINE 352: preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
LINE 353: entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
LINE 354: complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
LINE 355: opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
LINE 356: Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
LINE 357: she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
LINE 358: which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
LINE 359: amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be
LINE 360: prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
LINE 361: began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
LINE 362: her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.
LINE 363: She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
LINE 364: talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
LINE 365: signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
LINE 366: impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
LINE 367: interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
LINE 368: and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--
LINE 369: "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
LINE 370: Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."
LINE 371: Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
LINE 372: Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
LINE 373: her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
LINE 374: "If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
LINE 375: should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
LINE 376: air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
LINE 377: compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
LINE 378: to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
LINE 379: music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
LINE 380: rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such
LINE 381: an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
LINE 382: offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
LINE 383: that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
LINE 384: and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
LINE 385: as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
LINE 386: that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
LINE 387: everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I
LINE 388: cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who
LINE 389: should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
LINE 390: connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded
LINE 391: his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
LINE 392: room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.
LINE 393: Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for
LINE 394: having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady
LINE 395: Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
LINE 396: To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
LINE 397: expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
LINE 398: have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
LINE 399: finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
LINE 400: that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
LINE 401: feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
LINE 402: must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
LINE 403: have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
LINE 404: she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
LINE 405: the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
LINE 406: The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
LINE 407: Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
LINE 408: could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
LINE 409: power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
LINE 410: somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
LINE 411: room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent
LINE 412: to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
LINE 413: himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining
LINE 414: close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a
LINE 415: project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who
LINE 416: often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation
LINE 417: to herself.
LINE 418: She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's further notice:
LINE 419: though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
LINE 420: disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
LINE 421: probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
LINE 422: it.
LINE 423: The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
LINE 424: manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
LINE 425: hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
LINE 426: heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
LINE 427: sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
LINE 428: were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
LINE 429: every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
LINE 430: languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
LINE 431: speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
LINE 432: sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
LINE 433: politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
LINE 434: nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
LINE 435: Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the
LINE 436: rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
LINE 437: silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
LINE 438: much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
LINE 439: how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.
LINE 440: When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
LINE 441: civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
LINE 442: addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
LINE 443: he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
LINE 444: without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful
LINE 445: pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
LINE 446: waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
LINE 447: go the next day for a short time.
LINE 448: Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
LINE 449: delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
LINE 450: settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
LINE 451: see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
LINE 452: months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought
LINE 453: with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
LINE 454: Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
LINE 455: man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
LINE 456: was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
