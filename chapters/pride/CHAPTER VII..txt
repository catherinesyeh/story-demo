LINE 1: Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
LINE 2: thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in
LINE 3: default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
LINE 4: fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
LINE 5: the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
LINE 6: had left her four thousand pounds.
LINE 7: She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
LINE 8: father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
LINE 9: London in a respectable line of trade.
LINE 10: The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
LINE 11: convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
LINE 12: thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
LINE 13: to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
LINE 14: Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
LINE 15: their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
LINE 16: better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
LINE 17: hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
LINE 18: the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
LINE 19: from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
LINE 20: news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
LINE 21: neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
LINE 22: head quarters.
LINE 23: Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
LINE 24: intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
LINE 25: officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
LINE 26: and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips
LINE 27: visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
LINE 28: unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
LINE 29: Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
LINE 30: mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
LINE 31: an ensign.
LINE 32: After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
LINE 33: Bennet coolly observed,
LINE 34: "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
LINE 35: of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
LINE 36: I am now convinced."
LINE 37: Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
LINE 38: indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
LINE 39: her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
LINE 40: next morning to London.
LINE 41: "I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so
LINE 42: ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
LINE 43: of any body's children, it should not be of my own however."
LINE 44: "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."
LINE 45: "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
LINE 46: "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
LINE 47: had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
LINE 48: so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
LINE 49: foolish."
LINE 50: "My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
LINE 51: their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will
LINE 52: not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
LINE 53: liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart;
LINE 54: and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should
LINE 55: want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel
LINE 56: Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his
LINE 57: regimentals."
LINE 58: "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
LINE 59: Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
LINE 60: came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."
LINE 61: Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
LINE 62: note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
LINE 63: for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
LINE 64: eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
LINE 65: "Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well,
LINE 66: Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."
LINE 67: "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.
LINE 68: "My dear Friend,
LINE 69: "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
LINE 70: me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
LINE 71: lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never
LINE 72: end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
LINE 73: this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
LINE 74: Yours ever,
LINE 75: "CAROLINE BINGLEY."
LINE 76: "With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
LINE 77: _that_."
LINE 78: "Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."
LINE 79: "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.
LINE 80: "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
LINE 81: rain; and then you must stay all night."
LINE 82: "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
LINE 83: they would not offer to send her home."
LINE 84: "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
LINE 85: and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
LINE 86: "I had much rather go in the coach."
LINE 87: "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
LINE 88: wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"
LINE 89: "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
LINE 90: "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
LINE 91: will be answered."
LINE 92: She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
LINE 93: were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
LINE 94: mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
LINE 95: day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
LINE 96: rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
LINE 97: delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
LINE 98: Jane certainly could not come back.
LINE 99: "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet, more than
LINE 100: once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
LINE 101: morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
LINE 102: contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
LINE 103: brought the following note for Elizabeth:
LINE 104: "My dearest Lizzy,
LINE 105: "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
LINE 106: imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
LINE 107: not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
LINE 108: my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
LINE 109: of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache
LINE 110: there is not much the matter with me.
LINE 111: "Yours, &c."
LINE 112: "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
LINE 113: aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she
LINE 114: should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
LINE 115: Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."
LINE 116: "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
LINE 117: trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
LINE 118: there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the
LINE 119: carriage."
LINE 120: Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
LINE 121: the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking
LINE 122: was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
LINE 123: "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
LINE 124: thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
LINE 125: there."
LINE 126: "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."
LINE 127: "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
LINE 128: horses?"
LINE 129: "No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
LINE 130: when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."
LINE 131: "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
LINE 132: impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
LINE 133: exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
LINE 134: "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and
LINE 135: Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set
LINE 136: off together.
LINE 137: "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
LINE 138: see something of Captain Carter before he goes."
LINE 139: In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
LINE 140: of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
LINE 141: field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
LINE 142: over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within
LINE 143: view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
LINE 144: glowing with the warmth of exercise.
LINE 145: She was shewn into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
LINE 146: assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of
LINE 147: surprise.--That she should have walked three miles so early in the day,
LINE 148: in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs.
LINE 149: Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her
LINE 150: in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them;
LINE 151: and in their brother's manners there was something better than
LINE 152: politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very
LINE 153: little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between
LINE 154: admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion,
LINE 155: and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The
LINE 156: latter was thinking only of his breakfast.
LINE 157: Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
LINE 158: Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well
LINE 159: enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
LINE 160: immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
LINE 161: alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
LINE 162: for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
LINE 163: however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together,
LINE 164: could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
LINE 165: extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
LINE 166: her.
LINE 167: When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
LINE 168: began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
LINE 169: solicitude they shewed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
LINE 170: examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
LINE 171: violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
LINE 172: advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
LINE 173: was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
LINE 174: ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
LINE 175: the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
LINE 176: nothing to do elsewhere.
LINE 177: When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very
LINE 178: unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
LINE 179: wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
LINE 180: in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
LINE 181: of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
LINE 182: present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
LINE 183: dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
LINE 184: back a supply of clothes.
