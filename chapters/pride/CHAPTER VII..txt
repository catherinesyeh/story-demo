LINE 2: Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
LINE 3: thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
LINE 4: in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
LINE 5: fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
LINE 6: the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
LINE 7: had left her four thousand pounds.
LINE 8: She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
LINE 9: father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
LINE 10: London in a respectable line of trade.
LINE 11: The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
LINE 12: convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
LINE 13: thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
LINE 14: to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
LINE 15: Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
LINE 16: their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
LINE 17: better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
LINE 18: hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
LINE 19: news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
LINE 20: some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
LINE 21: with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
LINE 22: the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was
LINE 23: the head-quarters.
LINE 24: Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
LINE 25: intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the
LINE 26: officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,
LINE 27: and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips
LINE 28: visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
LINE 29: unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
LINE 30: Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
LINE 31: mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
LINE 32: an ensign.
LINE 33: After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
LINE 34: Bennet coolly observed,--
LINE 35: "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
LINE 36: of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
LINE 37: I am now convinced."
LINE 38: Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
LINE 39: indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
LINE 40: her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
LINE 41: next morning to London.
LINE 42: "I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so
LINE 43: ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
LINE 44: of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."
LINE 45: "If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."
LINE 46: "Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
LINE 47: "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
LINE 48: had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
LINE 49: so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
LINE 50: foolish."
LINE 51: "My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
LINE 52: their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
LINE 53: not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I
LINE 54: liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
LINE 55: heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
LINE 56: should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
LINE 57: Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in
LINE 58: his regimentals."
LINE 59: "Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
LINE 60: Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
LINE 61: came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."
LINE 62: Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
LINE 63: note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
LINE 64: for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
LINE 65: eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--
LINE 66: "Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
LINE 67: Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."
LINE 68: "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.
LINE 69: /* NIND "My dear friend, */
LINE 70: "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
LINE 71: me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
LINE 72: lives; for a whole day's _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
LINE 73: end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
LINE 74: this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
LINE 75: Yours ever,
LINE 76: "CAROLINE BINGLEY."
LINE 77: "With the officers!" cried Lydia: "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
LINE 78: _that_."
LINE 79: "Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet; "that is very unlucky."
LINE 80: "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.
LINE 81: "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
LINE 82: rain; and then you must stay all night."
LINE 83: "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
LINE 84: they would not offer to send her home."
LINE 85: "Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton;
LINE 86: and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
LINE 87: "I had much rather go in the coach."
LINE 88: "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
LINE 89: wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"
LINE 90: [Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]
LINE 91: "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
LINE 92: "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
LINE 93: will be answered."
LINE 94: She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
LINE 95: were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
LINE 96: mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
LINE 97: day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
LINE 98: rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
LINE 99: delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
LINE 100: Jane certainly could not come back.
LINE 101: "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet, more than
LINE 102: once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next
LINE 103: morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
LINE 104: contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
LINE 105: brought the following note for Elizabeth:--
LINE 106: /* NIND "My dearest Lizzie, */
LINE 107: "I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
LINE 108: imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will
LINE 109: not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on
LINE 110: my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
LINE 111: of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a
LINE 112: headache, there is not much the matter with me.
LINE 113: "Yours, etc."
LINE 114: "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
LINE 115: aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
LINE 116: should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
LINE 117: Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."
LINE 118: "Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little
LINE 119: trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays
LINE 120: there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the
LINE 121: carriage."
LINE 122: Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
LINE 123: carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
LINE 124: her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
LINE 125: "How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
LINE 126: thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
LINE 127: there."
LINE 128: "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."
LINE 129: "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
LINE 130: horses?"
LINE 131: "No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,
LINE 132: when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."
LINE 133: "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
LINE 134: impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
LINE 135: exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
LINE 136: "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.
LINE 137: Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
LINE 138: together.
LINE 139: "If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
LINE 140: see something of Captain Carter, before he goes."
LINE 141: In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
LINE 142: of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
LINE 143: field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
LINE 144: over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
LINE 145: within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
LINE 146: glowing with the warmth of exercise.
LINE 147: She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were
LINE 148: assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
LINE 149: That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
LINE 150: dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
LINE 151: Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
LINE 152: for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
LINE 153: brother's manners there was something better than politeness--there was
LINE 154: good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
LINE 155: nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
LINE 156: brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
LINE 157: the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
LINE 158: thinking only of his breakfast.
LINE 159: Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
LINE 160: Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
LINE 161: enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
LINE 162: immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
LINE 163: alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
LINE 164: for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
LINE 165: however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,
LINE 166: could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
LINE 167: extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
LINE 168: her.
LINE 169: When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
LINE 170: began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
LINE 171: solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having
LINE 172: examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
LINE 173: violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
LINE 174: advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
LINE 175: was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
LINE 176: ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
LINE 177: the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
LINE 178: nothing to do elsewhere.
LINE 179: When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
LINE 180: unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
LINE 181: wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
LINE 182: at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
LINE 183: of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
LINE 184: present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
LINE 185: despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
LINE 186: back a supply of clothes.
