LINE 2: Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
LINE 3: her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,
LINE 4: resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
LINE 5: But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
LINE 6: arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the
LINE 7: place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
LINE 8: to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
LINE 9: carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
LINE 10: curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the
LINE 11: livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
LINE 12: to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
LINE 13: expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
LINE 14: of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
LINE 15: of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
LINE 16: the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
LINE 17: that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
LINE 18: a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
LINE 19: newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
LINE 20: Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed
LINE 21: at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
LINE 22: dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
LINE 23: her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
LINE 24: suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
LINE 25: She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
LINE 26: up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
LINE 27: inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
LINE 28: Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
LINE 29: took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
LINE 30: acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
LINE 31: being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
LINE 32: but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
LINE 33: only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
LINE 34: her beyond a monosyllable.
LINE 35: Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
LINE 36: little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
LINE 37: womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there
LINE 38: was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
LINE 39: unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
LINE 40: acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
LINE 41: relieved by discerning such different feelings.
LINE 42: They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was
LINE 43: also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
LINE 44: satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step
LINE 45: was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
LINE 46: Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
LINE 47: felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
LINE 48: cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
LINE 49: inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and
LINE 50: looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
LINE 51: To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
LINE 52: than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
LINE 53: them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
LINE 54: arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
LINE 55: each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from
LINE 56: those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
LINE 57: it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in
LINE 58: doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
LINE 59: evident enough.
LINE 60: Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
LINE 61: feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
LINE 62: make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
LINE 63: feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom
LINE 64: she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.
LINE 65: Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be
LINE 66: pleased.
LINE 67: [Illustration:

LINE 70: In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
LINE 71: how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
LINE 72: like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
LINE 73: former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
LINE 74: that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
LINE 75: though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
LINE 76: behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No
LINE 77: look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing
LINE 78: occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On
LINE 79: this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances
LINE 80: occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted
LINE 81: a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
LINE 82: saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He
LINE 83: observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and
LINE 84: in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long
LINE 85: time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could
LINE 86: reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the
LINE 87: 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."
LINE 88: Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
LINE 89: took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
LINE 90: _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
LINE 91: nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
LINE 92: gave them meaning.
LINE 93: It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but
LINE 94: whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
LINE 95: complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
LINE 96: removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her
LINE 97: that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
LINE 98: however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
LINE 99: day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the
LINE 100: good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would
LINE 101: have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,
LINE 102: but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected
LINE 103: their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the
LINE 104: change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could
LINE 105: hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the
LINE 106: company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
LINE 107: at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
LINE 108: self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could
LINE 109: result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
LINE 110: acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
LINE 111: down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
LINE 112: Rosings.
LINE 113: Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose
LINE 114: to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
LINE 115: their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
LINE 116: at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
LINE 117: diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
LINE 118: readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
LINE 119: how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
LINE 120: acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,
LINE 121: that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
LINE 122: any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
LINE 123: society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
LINE 124: her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
LINE 125: Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
LINE 126: again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
LINE 127: make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
LINE 128: this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
LINE 129: on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
LINE 130: visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
LINE 131: satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
LINE 132: little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
LINE 133: uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
LINE 134: favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
LINE 135: But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
LINE 136: not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
LINE 137: much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
LINE 138: it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
LINE 139: interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
LINE 140: Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
LINE 141: as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
LINE 142: not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
LINE 143: from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference
LINE 144: to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
LINE 145: would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
LINE 146: however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
LINE 147: that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four
LINE 148: years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
LINE 149: hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
LINE 150: their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
LINE 151: nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
LINE 152: it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
LINE 153: where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
LINE 154: was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
LINE 155: With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
LINE 156: there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
LINE 157: son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
LINE 158: fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
LINE 159: him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
LINE 160: As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
LINE 161: the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
LINE 162: long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
LINE 163: she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She
LINE 164: certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
LINE 165: had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
LINE 166: that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
LINE 167: valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
LINE 168: time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
LINE 169: into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
LINE 170: favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
LINE 171: which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
LINE 172: there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be
LINE 173: overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once
LINE 174: loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
LINE 175: petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
LINE 176: unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been
LINE 177: persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
LINE 178: accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
LINE 179: without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
LINE 180: where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
LINE 181: opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such
LINE 182: a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
LINE 183: gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
LINE 184: such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
LINE 185: means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,
LINE 186: she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
LINE 187: welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
LINE 188: depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
LINE 189: that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
LINE 190: possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.
LINE 191: It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
LINE 192: such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very
LINE 193: day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late
LINE 194: breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
LINE 195: some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
LINE 196: would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
LINE 197: morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
LINE 198: she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
LINE 199: Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
LINE 200: renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
LINE 201: some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.
