LINE 1: The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
LINE 2: was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
LINE 3: good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
LINE 4: found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a
LINE 5: wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the
LINE 6: two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
LINE 7: pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
LINE 8: every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
LINE 9: though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
LINE 10: all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was
LINE 11: generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to
LINE 12: _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
LINE 13: which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
LINE 14: way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
LINE 15: was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
LINE 16: united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
LINE 17: uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
LINE 18: suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss
LINE 19: Lucas.
LINE 20: "It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
LINE 21: on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
LINE 22: so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
LINE 23: from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
LINE 24: it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
LINE 25: dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
LINE 26: attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
LINE 27: _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
LINE 28: very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
LINE 29: encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_
LINE 30: affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
LINE 31: may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
LINE 32: "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can
LINE 33: perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
LINE 34: discover it too."
LINE 35: "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."
LINE 36: "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
LINE 37: it, he must find it out."
LINE 38: "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane
LINE 39: meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
LINE 40: always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
LINE 41: every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
LINE 42: therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
LINE 43: attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
LINE 44: in love as much as she chuses."
LINE 45: "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
LINE 46: question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
LINE 47: to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
LINE 48: these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she
LINE 49: cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
LINE 50: reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
LINE 51: dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
LINE 52: and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
LINE 53: enough to make her understand his character."
LINE 54: "Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
LINE 55: only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
LINE 56: remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
LINE 57: evenings may do a great deal."
LINE 58: "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
LINE 59: like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
LINE 60: leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
LINE 61: "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
LINE 62: she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
LINE 63: chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a
LINE 64: twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
LINE 65: the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
LINE 66: ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the
LINE 67: least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
LINE 68: have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
LINE 69: possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
LINE 70: life."
LINE 71: "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
LINE 72: sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
LINE 73: Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
LINE 74: was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
LINE 75: interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
LINE 76: allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
LINE 77: ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
LINE 78: sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
LINE 79: hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
LINE 80: uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
LINE 81: this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
LINE 82: detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
LINE 83: in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
LINE 84: pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
LINE 85: of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
LINE 86: this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made
LINE 87: himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough
LINE 88: to dance with.
LINE 89: He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
LINE 90: with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
LINE 91: drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
LINE 92: assembled.
LINE 93: "What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
LINE 94: conversation with Colonel Forster?"
LINE 95: "That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."
LINE 96: "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
LINE 97: what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
LINE 98: being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
LINE 99: On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
LINE 100: any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
LINE 101: a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
LINE 102: turned to him and said,
LINE 103: "Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
LINE 104: just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
LINE 105: Meryton?"
LINE 106: "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady
LINE 107: energetic."
LINE 108: "You are severe on us."
LINE 109: "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas. "I am going
LINE 110: to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
LINE 111: "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
LINE 112: to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken
LINE 113: a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would
LINE 114: really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
LINE 115: hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
LINE 116: she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
LINE 117: at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of
LINE 118: course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I
LINE 119: shall keep mine to swell my song."
LINE 120: Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
LINE 121: or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
LINE 122: would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
LINE 123: sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
LINE 124: the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
LINE 125: impatient for display.
LINE 126: Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
LINE 127: application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
LINE 128: manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
LINE 129: had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
LINE 130: much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
LINE 131: end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
LINE 132: Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
LINE 133: some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing
LINE 134: at one end of the room.
LINE 135: Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
LINE 136: passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
LINE 137: much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
LINE 138: was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.
LINE 139: "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There
LINE 140: is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first
LINE 141: refinements of polished societies."
LINE 142: "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
LINE 143: amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can
LINE 144: dance."
LINE 145: Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully;" he
LINE 146: continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt
LINE 147: not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."
LINE 148: "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."
LINE 149: "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
LINE 150: you often dance at St. James's?"
LINE 151: "Never, sir."
LINE 152: "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
LINE 153: "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
LINE 154: "You have a house in town, I conclude?"
LINE 155: Mr. Darcy bowed.
LINE 156: "I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of
LINE 157: superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
LINE 158: London would agree with Lady Lucas."
LINE 159: He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to
LINE 160: make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
LINE 161: struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
LINE 162: her,
LINE 163: "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?--Mr. Darcy, you must allow
LINE 164: me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You
LINE 165: cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
LINE 166: And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
LINE 167: extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
LINE 168: drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,
LINE 169: "Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you
LINE 170: not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."
LINE 171: Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her
LINE 172: hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all
LINE 173: shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
LINE 174: "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
LINE 175: the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
LINE 176: amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
LINE 177: for one half hour."
LINE 178: "Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.
LINE 179: "He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
LINE 180: cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
LINE 181: partner?"
LINE 182: Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
LINE 183: injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
LINE 184: complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,
LINE 185: "I can guess the subject of your reverie."
LINE 186: "I should imagine not."
LINE 187: "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
LINE 188: in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
LINE 189: I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the
LINE 190: nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would
LINE 191: I give to hear your strictures on them!"
LINE 192: "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
LINE 193: agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
LINE 194: which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."
LINE 195: Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
LINE 196: would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
LINE 197: Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,
LINE 198: "Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
LINE 199: "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.
LINE 200: How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you
LINE 201: joy?"
LINE 202: "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
LINE 203: imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
LINE 204: to matrimony in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."
LINE 205: "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
LINE 206: absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
LINE 207: of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."
LINE 208: He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
LINE 209: entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her
LINE 210: that all was safe, her wit flowed long.
