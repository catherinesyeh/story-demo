LINE 2: The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
LINE 3: was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the
LINE 4: good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
LINE 5: found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
LINE 6: a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the
LINE 7: two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
LINE 8: pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
LINE 9: everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
LINE 10: though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
LINE 11: in all probability, from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
LINE 12: was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and
LINE 13: to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
LINE 14: which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
LINE 15: way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
LINE 16: was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
LINE 17: united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an
LINE 18: uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
LINE 19: suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss
LINE 20: Lucas.
LINE 21: "It may, perhaps, be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
LINE 22: on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
LINE 23: so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
LINE 24: from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
LINE 25: it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
LINE 26: dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
LINE 27: attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
LINE 28: _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
LINE 29: very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
LINE 30: encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_
LINE 31: affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
LINE 32: may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
LINE 33: "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can
LINE 34: perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
LINE 35: discover it too."
LINE 36: "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."
LINE 37: "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal
LINE 38: it, he must find it out."
LINE 39: "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane
LINE 40: meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
LINE 41: always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
LINE 42: every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
LINE 43: therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
LINE 44: attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
LINE 45: in love as much as she chooses."
LINE 46: "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
LINE 47: question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
LINE 48: to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
LINE 49: these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she
LINE 50: cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
LINE 51: reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
LINE 52: dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
LINE 53: and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite
LINE 54: enough to make her understand his character."
LINE 55: "Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
LINE 56: only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
LINE 57: remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
LINE 58: evenings may do a great deal."
LINE 59: "Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
LINE 60: like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other
LINE 61: leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
LINE 62: "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
LINE 63: she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
LINE 64: chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
LINE 65: twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
LINE 66: the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
LINE 67: ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
LINE 68: least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
LINE 69: have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
LINE 70: possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
LINE 71: life."
LINE 72: "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
LINE 73: sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
LINE 74: Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attention to her sister, Elizabeth
LINE 75: was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
LINE 76: interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
LINE 77: allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the
LINE 78: ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
LINE 79: sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
LINE 80: hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
LINE 81: uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
LINE 82: this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
LINE 83: detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
LINE 84: in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
LINE 85: pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
LINE 86: of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
LINE 87: this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made
LINE 88: himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
LINE 89: to dance with.
LINE 90: He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
LINE 91: with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
LINE 92: drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
LINE 93: assembled.
LINE 94: "What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
LINE 95: conversation with Colonel Forster?"
LINE 96: "That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."
LINE 97: "But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see
LINE 98: what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
LINE 99: being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
LINE 100: [Illustration: "The entreaties of several" [_Copyright 1894 by George
LINE 101: Allen._]]
LINE 102: On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
LINE 103: any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
LINE 104: a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
LINE 105: turned to him and said,--
LINE 106: "Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
LINE 107: just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
LINE 108: Meryton?"
LINE 109: "With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady
LINE 110: energetic."
LINE 111: "You are severe on us."
LINE 112: "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going
LINE 113: to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
LINE 114: "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
LINE 115: to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a
LINE 116: musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
LINE 117: really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
LINE 118: hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
LINE 119: she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
LINE 120: at Mr. Darcy, "There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is
LINE 121: of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and
LINE 122: I shall keep mine to swell my song."
LINE 123: Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
LINE 124: or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
LINE 125: would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
LINE 126: sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
LINE 127: the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
LINE 128: impatient for display.
LINE 129: Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
LINE 130: application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
LINE 131: manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
LINE 132: had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
LINE 133: much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
LINE 134: end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
LINE 135: Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
LINE 136: some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
LINE 137: dancing at one end of the room.
LINE 138: Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
LINE 139: passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
LINE 140: much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
LINE 141: was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--
LINE 142: "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is
LINE 143: nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first
LINE 144: refinements of polished societies."
LINE 145: "Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
LINE 146: the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance."
LINE 147: Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he
LINE 148: continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubt
LINE 149: not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."
LINE 150: "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."
LINE 151: "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
LINE 152: you often dance at St. James's?"
LINE 153: "Never, sir."
LINE 154: "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
LINE 155: "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
LINE 156: "You have a house in town, I conclude?"
LINE 157: Mr. Darcy bowed.
LINE 158: "I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of
LINE 159: superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
LINE 160: London would agree with Lady Lucas."
LINE 161: He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
LINE 162: make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
LINE 163: struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
LINE 164: her,--
LINE 165: "My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
LINE 166: me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
LINE 167: cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you."
LINE 168: And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
LINE 169: extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
LINE 170: drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--
LINE 171: "Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
LINE 172: not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."
LINE 173: Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
LINE 174: her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
LINE 175: all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
LINE 176: "You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
LINE 177: the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
LINE 178: amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
LINE 179: for one half hour."
LINE 180: "Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.
LINE 181: "He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
LINE 182: cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
LINE 183: partner?"
LINE 184: Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured
LINE 185: her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
LINE 186: complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--
LINE 187: "I can guess the subject of your reverie."
LINE 188: "I should imagine not."
LINE 189: "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
LINE 190: evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of
LINE 191: your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
LINE 192: noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
LINE 193: people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"
LINE 194: "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
LINE 195: agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
LINE 196: which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."
LINE 197: Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
LINE 198: would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
LINE 199: Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--
LINE 200: "Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
LINE 201: "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.
LINE 202: How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you
LINE 203: joy?"
LINE 204: "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
LINE 205: imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
LINE 206: to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."
LINE 207: "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
LINE 208: absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
LINE 209: of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."
LINE 210: He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
LINE 211: entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
LINE 212: that all was safe, her wit flowed along.
