LINE 2: As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
LINE 3: aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
LINE 4: a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
LINE 5: conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
LINE 6: girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
LINE 7: that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
LINE 8: the house.
LINE 9: When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
LINE 10: Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
LINE 11: struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
LINE 12: might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
LINE 13: at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
LINE 14: gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
LINE 15: was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
LINE 16: description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
LINE 17: that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
LINE 18: the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
LINE 19: with the housekeeper's room.
LINE 20: In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
LINE 21: with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
LINE 22: improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
LINE 23: gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
LINE 24: listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
LINE 25: heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
LINE 26: soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
LINE 27: and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
LINE 28: their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
LINE 29: interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
LINE 30: The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
LINE 31: Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
LINE 32: of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The
LINE 33: officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
LINE 34: gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
LINE 35: Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
LINE 36: walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
LINE 37: breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
LINE 38: [Illustration:

LINE 41: Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
LINE 42: turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
LINE 43: himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
LINE 44: conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
LINE 45: probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
LINE 46: dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
LINE 47: skill of the speaker.
LINE 48: With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
LINE 49: officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
LINE 50: ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
LINE 51: listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
LINE 52: supplied with coffee and muffin.
LINE 53: When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,
LINE 54: in return, by sitting down to whist.
LINE 55: "I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to
LINE 56: improve myself; for in my situation of life----" Mrs. Philips was very
LINE 57: thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
LINE 58: Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
LINE 59: received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
LINE 60: seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
LINE 61: determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
LINE 62: she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
LINE 63: and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
LINE 64: Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
LINE 65: at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
LINE 66: though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
LINE 67: the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even
LINE 68: mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
LINE 69: relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
LINE 70: Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
LINE 71: a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
LINE 72: "About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
LINE 73: drop, added, "he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
LINE 74: understand."
LINE 75: "Yes," replied Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten
LINE 76: thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of
LINE 77: giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
LINE 78: connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy."
LINE 79: Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
LINE 80: "You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
LINE 81: seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
LINE 82: yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"
LINE 83: "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth, warmly. "I have spent
LINE 84: four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
LINE 85: disagreeable."
LINE 86: "I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
LINE 87: agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
LINE 88: too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to
LINE 89: be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
LINE 90: astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
LINE 91: anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."
LINE 92: "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
LINE 93: neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
LINE 94: Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
LINE 95: him more favourably spoken of by anyone."
LINE 96: "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
LINE 97: interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
LINE 98: their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
LINE 99: world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
LINE 100: high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."
LINE 101: "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
LINE 102: ill-tempered man."
LINE 103: Wickham only shook his head.
LINE 104: "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
LINE 105: likely to be in this country much longer."
LINE 106: "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
LINE 107: was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
LINE 108: not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."
LINE 109: "Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
LINE 110: wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
LINE 111: and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
LINE 112: avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
LINE 113: very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
LINE 114: His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
LINE 115: that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
LINE 116: in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
LINE 117: thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
LINE 118: scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
LINE 119: everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
LINE 120: memory of his father."
LINE 121: Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
LINE 122: all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
LINE 123: Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
LINE 124: neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
LINE 125: had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
LINE 126: very intelligible gallantry.
LINE 127: "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
LINE 128: "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a
LINE 129: most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me
LINE 130: further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
LINE 131: attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.
LINE 132: Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
LINE 133: my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
LINE 134: A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
LINE 135: now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
LINE 136: was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in
LINE 137: possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
LINE 138: were speaking of just now."
LINE 139: "Indeed!"
LINE 140: "Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
LINE 141: living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
LINE 142: I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
LINE 143: and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
LINE 144: elsewhere."
LINE 145: "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be? How could his
LINE 146: will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?"
LINE 147: "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
LINE 148: give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
LINE 149: intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
LINE 150: conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
LINE 151: to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
LINE 152: Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
LINE 153: was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
LINE 154: less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
LINE 155: anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I
LINE 156: may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
LINE 157: freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very
LINE 158: different sort of men, and that he hates me."
LINE 159: "This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."
LINE 160: "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
LINE 161: can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."
LINE 162: Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
LINE 163: ever as he expressed them.
LINE 164: "But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? what can
LINE 165: have induced him to behave so cruelly?"
LINE 166: "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
LINE 167: attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
LINE 168: less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
LINE 169: attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
LINE 170: not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
LINE 171: of preference which was often given me."
LINE 172: "I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
LINE 173: him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
LINE 174: despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
LINE 175: descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
LINE 176: this!"
LINE 177: After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_
LINE 178: remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
LINE 179: his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
LINE 180: must be dreadful."
LINE 181: "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "_I_ can
LINE 182: hardly be just to him."
LINE 183: Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
LINE 184: treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
LINE 185: father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
LINE 186: countenance may vouch for your being amiable." But she contented herself
LINE 187: with--"And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
LINE 188: childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
LINE 189: manner."
LINE 190: "We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
LINE 191: part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
LINE 192: sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
LINE 193: father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,
LINE 194: appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
LINE 195: to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
LINE 196: Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
LINE 197: intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
LINE 198: be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence;
LINE 199: and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
LINE 200: voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it
LINE 201: to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself."
LINE 202: "How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very
LINE 203: pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better
LINE 204: motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
LINE 205: dishonesty I must call it."
LINE 206: "It _is_ wonderful," replied Wickham; "for almost all his actions may be
LINE 207: traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has
LINE 208: connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none
LINE 209: of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
LINE 210: impulses even than pride."
LINE 211: "Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"
LINE 212: "Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
LINE 213: freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
LINE 214: poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his
LINE 215: father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
LINE 216: degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
LINE 217: Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
LINE 218: which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
LINE 219: careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
LINE 220: as the most attentive and best of brothers."
LINE 221: "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"
LINE 222: He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
LINE 223: speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
LINE 224: proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
LINE 225: of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
LINE 226: nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
LINE 227: and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death her
LINE 228: home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
LINE 229: education."
LINE 230: After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
LINE 231: help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--
LINE 232: "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,
LINE 233: who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
LINE 234: be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
LINE 235: know Mr. Bingley?"
LINE 236: "Not at all."
LINE 237: "He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
LINE 238: Darcy is."
LINE 239: "Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
LINE 240: want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
LINE 241: his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
LINE 242: very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride
LINE 243: never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
LINE 244: sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
LINE 245: something for fortune and figure."
LINE 246: The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
LINE 247: the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
LINE 248: Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
LINE 249: made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
LINE 250: but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
LINE 251: her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
LINE 252: that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
LINE 253: make herself uneasy.
LINE 254: "I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
LINE 255: card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
LINE 256: am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
LINE 257: are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady
LINE 258: Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
LINE 259: little matters."
LINE 260: Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
LINE 261: a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations
LINE 262: were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.
LINE 263: "Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a
LINE 264: living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
LINE 265: notice, but he certainly has not known her long."
LINE 266: "You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
LINE 267: were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."
LINE 268: "No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
LINE 269: connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
LINE 270: yesterday."
LINE 271: "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
LINE 272: believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."
LINE 273: This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
LINE 274: Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
LINE 275: affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
LINE 276: self-destined to another.
LINE 277: "Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
LINE 278: daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her
LINE 279: Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
LINE 280: her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
LINE 281: "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
LINE 282: not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked
LINE 283: her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
LINE 284: reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
LINE 285: she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
LINE 286: her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
LINE 287: chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
LINE 288: the first class."
LINE 289: Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
LINE 290: they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
LINE 291: an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
LINE 292: Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of
LINE 293: Mrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to
LINE 294: everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
LINE 295: gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
LINE 296: think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
LINE 297: the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
LINE 298: they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
LINE 299: talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
LINE 300: fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
LINE 301: Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
LINE 302: at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
LINE 303: that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
LINE 304: before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
