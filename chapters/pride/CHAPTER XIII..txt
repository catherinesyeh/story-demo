LINE 2: "I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
LINE 3: breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
LINE 4: because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."
LINE 5: "Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
LINE 6: unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners
LINE 7: are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."
LINE 8: "The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger."
LINE 9: Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
LINE 10: Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly
LINE 11: thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.
LINE 12: But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got
LINE 13: to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this
LINE 14: moment."
LINE 15: "It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
LINE 16: never saw in the whole course of my life."
LINE 17: This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
LINE 18: eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
LINE 19: After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
LINE 20: explained:--"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a
LINE 21: fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,
LINE 22: and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
LINE 23: when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
LINE 24: pleases."
LINE 25: "Oh, my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
LINE 26: Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
LINE 27: in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
LINE 28: children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
LINE 29: to do something or other about it."
LINE 30: Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
LINE 31: They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.
LINE 32: Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
LINE 33: bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
LINE 34: five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
LINE 35: "It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet; "and
LINE 36: nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
LINE 37: But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little
LINE 38: softened by his manner of expressing himself."
LINE 39: "No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of
LINE 40: him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
LINE 41: friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
LINE 42: did before him?"
LINE 43: "Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
LINE 44: head, as you will hear."
LINE 45: /* RIGHT "Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */
LINE 46: "Dear Sir,
LINE 47: "The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
LINE 48: father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the
LINE 49: misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
LINE 50: breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,
LINE 51: fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
LINE 52: on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
LINE 53: at variance."--'There, Mrs. Bennet.'--"My mind, however, is now
LINE 54: made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,
LINE 55: I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
LINE 56: the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis
LINE 57: de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
LINE 58: valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
LINE 59: endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
LINE 60: Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
LINE 61: which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
LINE 62: moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
LINE 63: of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
LINE 64: these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of
LINE 65: good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
LINE 66: being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly
LINE 67: overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
LINE 68: olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
LINE 69: means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
LINE 70: apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
LINE 71: them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should
LINE 72: have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself
LINE 73: the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,
LINE 74: November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your
LINE 75: hospitality till the Saturday se'nnight following, which I can do
LINE 76: without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting
LINE 77: to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other
LINE 78: clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,
LINE 79: with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
LINE 80: well-wisher and friend,
LINE 81: "WILLIAM COLLINS."
LINE 82: "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
LINE 83: said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most
LINE 84: conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will
LINE 85: prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
LINE 86: indulgent as to let him come to us again."
LINE 87: "There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
LINE 88: he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
LINE 89: discourage him."
LINE 90: "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
LINE 91: to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
LINE 92: credit."
LINE 93: Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
LINE 94: Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
LINE 95: his parishioners whenever it were required.
LINE 96: "He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out. There
LINE 97: is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by
LINE 98: apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would
LINE 99: help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?"
LINE 100: "No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
LINE 101: reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
LINE 102: letter which promises well. I am impatient to see him."
LINE 103: "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem
LINE 104: defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
LINE 105: think it is well expressed."
LINE 106: To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
LINE 107: degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
LINE 108: come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
LINE 109: received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
LINE 110: their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
LINE 111: and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
LINE 112: astonished her husband and daughters.
LINE 113: Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
LINE 114: politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
LINE 115: ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
LINE 116: of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,
LINE 117: heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
LINE 118: stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
LINE 119: before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
LINE 120: daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
LINE 121: instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
LINE 122: doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This
LINE 123: gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
LINE 124: Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--
LINE 125: "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
LINE 126: prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
LINE 127: oddly."
LINE 128: "You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."
LINE 129: "Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
LINE 130: must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
LINE 131: I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
LINE 132: will go when once they come to be entailed."
LINE 133: "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
LINE 134: could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
LINE 135: forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
LINE 136: prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,
LINE 137: when we are better acquainted----"
LINE 138: He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
LINE 139: other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
LINE 140: hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
LINE 141: and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
LINE 142: heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
LINE 143: own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
LINE 144: and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
LINE 145: cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
LINE 146: him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good
LINE 147: cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged
LINE 148: pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
LINE 149: herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
LINE 150: quarter of an hour.
