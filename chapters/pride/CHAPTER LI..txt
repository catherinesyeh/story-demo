LINE 2: Their sister's wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
LINE 3: probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet
LINE 4: them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival
LINE 5: was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who
LINE 6: gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
LINE 7: been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
LINE 8: must endure.
LINE 9: They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
LINE 10: them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to
LINE 11: the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
LINE 12: anxious, uneasy.
LINE 13: Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
LINE 14: she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
LINE 15: welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
LINE 16: Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
LINE 17: alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.
LINE 18: Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
LINE 19: so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
LINE 20: opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
LINE 21: enough to provoke him.
LINE 22: Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was
LINE 23: Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned
LINE 24: from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
LINE 25: length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
LINE 26: some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a
LINE 27: great while since she had been there.
LINE 28: Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
LINE 29: were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
LINE 30: exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
LINE 31: claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth
LINE 32: had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
LINE 33: down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the
LINE 34: impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the
LINE 35: cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
LINE 36: colour.
LINE 37: There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
LINE 38: of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
LINE 39: Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
LINE 40: with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
LINE 41: replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
LINE 42: world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
LINE 43: voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
LINE 44: the world.
LINE 45: "Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away:
LINE 46: it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things
LINE 47: enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
LINE 48: I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
LINE 49: thought it would be very good fun if I was."
LINE 50: Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked
LINE 51: expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
LINE 52: which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--
LINE 53: "Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was
LINE 54: afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,
LINE 55: so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass
LINE 56: next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
LINE 57: window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and
LINE 58: smiled like anything."
LINE 59: Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;
LINE 60: and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
LINE 61: the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
LINE 62: anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to
LINE 63: her eldest sister,--
LINE 64: "Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a
LINE 65: married woman."
LINE 66: It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
LINE 67: from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
LINE 68: spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all
LINE 69: their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by
LINE 70: each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
LINE 71: and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
LINE 72: "Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the
LINE 73: breakfast-room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a
LINE 74: charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they
LINE 75: may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the
LINE 76: place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!"
LINE 77: "Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don't
LINE 78: at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"
LINE 79: "Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.
LINE 80: You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at
LINE 81: Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I
LINE 82: will take care to get good partners for them all."
LINE 83: "I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.
LINE 84: "And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
LINE 85: behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
LINE 86: winter is over."
LINE 87: "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
LINE 88: particularly like your way of getting husbands."
LINE 89: Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
LINE 90: had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
LINE 91: his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
LINE 92: No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
LINE 93: she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
LINE 94: having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
LINE 95: all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
LINE 96: think than such as did not.
LINE 97: Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to
LINE 98: find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her
LINE 99: present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
LINE 100: their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
LINE 101: than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
LINE 102: for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
LINE 103: that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
LINE 104: if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
LINE 105: of having a companion.
LINE 106: Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
LINE 107: occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did
LINE 108: everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds
LINE 109: on the first of September than anybody else in the country.
LINE 110: One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
LINE 111: elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--
LINE 112: "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were
LINE 113: not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you
LINE 114: curious to hear how it was managed?"
LINE 115: "No, really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little
LINE 116: said on the subject."
LINE 117: "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
LINE 118: married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
LINE 119: that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
LINE 120: o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
LINE 121: were to meet us at the church.
LINE 122: "Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,
LINE 123: you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should
LINE 124: have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was
LINE 125: dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
LINE 126: sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was
LINE 127: thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether
LINE 128: he would be married in his blue coat.
LINE 129: "Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never
LINE 130: be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
LINE 131: were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
LINE 132: me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
LINE 133: fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was
LINE 134: rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.
LINE 135: "Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
LINE 136: called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you
LINE 137: know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so
LINE 138: frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;
LINE 139: and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,
LINE 140: luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set
LINE 141: out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented
LINE 142: going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as
LINE 143: well."
LINE 144: "Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
LINE 145: "Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!
LINE 146: I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
LINE 147: them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
LINE 148: "If it was to be a secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
LINE 149: subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
LINE 150: "Oh, certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
LINE 151: ask you no questions."
LINE 152: "Thank you," said Lydia; "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
LINE 153: all, and then Wickham would be so angry."
LINE 154: On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
LINE 155: power, by running away.
LINE 156: But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
LINE 157: was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
LINE 158: sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
LINE 159: where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
LINE 160: Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
LINE 161: brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
LINE 162: placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
LINE 163: could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
LINE 164: wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
LINE 165: Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
LINE 166: intended.
LINE 167: "You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to
LINE 168: know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
LINE 169: speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
LINE 170: a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
LINE 171: for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to
LINE 172: think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
LINE 173: ignorance."
LINE 174: "Not that I _shall_, though," she added to herself, and she finished the
LINE 175: letter; "and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
LINE 176: manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
LINE 177: out."
LINE 178: Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
LINE 179: Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of
LINE 180: it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
LINE 181: satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.
