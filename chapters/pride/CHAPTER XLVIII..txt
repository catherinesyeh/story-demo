LINE 2: The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
LINE 3: morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
LINE 4: His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
LINE 5: dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
LINE 6: They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
LINE 7: send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
LINE 8: Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
LINE 9: When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
LINE 10: information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
LINE 11: to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to
LINE 12: the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
LINE 13: security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.
LINE 14: Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
LINE 15: days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
LINE 16: her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
LINE 17: great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
LINE 18: visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
LINE 19: cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
LINE 20: reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
LINE 21: she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
LINE 22: them.
LINE 23: All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
LINE 24: before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
LINE 25: to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
LINE 26: the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
LINE 27: Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and
LINE 28: everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
LINE 29: appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
LINE 30: half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
LINE 31: her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still
LINE 32: less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
LINE 33: come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before
LINE 34: entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
LINE 35: news of them.
LINE 36: Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a
LINE 37: letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately
LINE 38: found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.
LINE 39: That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but
LINE 40: without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
LINE 41: determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
LINE 42: thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
LINE 43: coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
LINE 44: did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
LINE 45: eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.
LINE 46: Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and
LINE 47: promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this
LINE 48: effect:--
LINE 49: "I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
LINE 50: possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
LINE 51: whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
LINE 52: know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there
LINE 53: were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such
LINE 54: a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
LINE 55: nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
LINE 56: his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps
LINE 57: Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
LINE 58: other person."
LINE 59: Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
LINE 60: her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
LINE 61: information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.
LINE 62: She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father
LINE 63: and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,
LINE 64: however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to
LINE 65: give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
LINE 66: it, the application was a something to look forward to.
LINE 67: Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
LINE 68: part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was
LINE 69: the first grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
LINE 70: whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
LINE 71: succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
LINE 72: But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
LINE 73: their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
LINE 74: had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
LINE 75: she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
LINE 76: letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
LINE 77: follows:--
LINE 78: /* "My dear Sir, */
LINE 79: "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
LINE 80: in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
LINE 81: suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
LINE 82: from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and
LINE 83: myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
LINE 84: family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
LINE 85: kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No
LINE 86: arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
LINE 87: a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
LINE 88: must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent's mind. The
LINE 89: death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
LINE 90: this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
LINE 91: suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
LINE 92: of behaviour in your
LINE 93: [Illustration:
LINE 94: "To whom I have related the affair"
LINE 95: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
LINE 96: daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,
LINE 97: at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,
LINE 98: I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
LINE 99: bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
LINE 100: age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in
LINE 101: which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by
LINE 102: Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.
LINE 103: They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one
LINE 104: daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
LINE 105: who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
LINE 106: themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,
LINE 107: moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain
LINE 108: event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been
LINE 109: involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,
LINE 110: my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
LINE 111: your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
LINE 112: reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.
LINE 113: "I am, dear sir," etc., etc.
LINE 114: Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
LINE 115: Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
LINE 116: It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up
LINE 117: any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His
LINE 118: former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
LINE 119: militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
LINE 120: with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out
LINE 121: as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own
LINE 122: finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
LINE 123: his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations; for it had just transpired
LINE 124: that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
LINE 125: Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
LINE 126: necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the
LINE 127: town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner
LINE 128: did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;
LINE 129: Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly
LINE 130: unexpected; I had not an idea of it."
LINE 131: Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
LINE 132: father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
LINE 133: spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
LINE 134: his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family and
LINE 135: leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
LINE 136: for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
LINE 137: not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
LINE 138: what her anxiety for his life had been before.
LINE 139: "What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he
LINE 140: will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
LINE 141: and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
LINE 142: As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
LINE 143: and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet
LINE 144: came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
LINE 145: journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
LINE 146: Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
LINE 147: Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
LINE 148: His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
LINE 149: and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of
LINE 150: their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
LINE 151: Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
LINE 152: Pemberley.
LINE 153: The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
LINE 154: the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
LINE 155: fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time
LINE 156: tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
LINE 157: that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
LINE 158: Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
LINE 159: one sleepless night out of two.
LINE 160: When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
LINE 161: philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
LINE 162: habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
LINE 163: away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
LINE 164: it.
LINE 165: It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
LINE 166: Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
LINE 167: expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
LINE 168: nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
LINE 169: and I ought to feel it."
LINE 170: "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.
LINE 171: "You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to
LINE 172: fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
LINE 173: been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
LINE 174: It will pass away soon enough."
LINE 175: "Do you suppose them to be in London?"
LINE 176: "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"
LINE 177: "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.
LINE 178: "She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there
LINE 179: will probably be of some duration."
LINE 180: Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no
LINE 181: ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,
LINE 182: considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."
LINE 183: They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
LINE 184: tea.
LINE 185: "This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an
LINE 186: elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
LINE 187: library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
LINE 188: I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away."
LINE 189: "I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty, fretfully. "If _I_
LINE 190: should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."
LINE 191: "_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,
LINE 192: for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and
LINE 193: you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house
LINE 194: again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
LINE 195: prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
LINE 196: never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
LINE 197: minutes of every day in a rational manner."
LINE 198: Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
LINE 199: "Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
LINE 200: girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
LINE 201: them."
