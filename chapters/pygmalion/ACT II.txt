LINE 1: Next day at 11 a.m. Higgins's laboratory in Wimpole Street. It is a
LINE 2: room on the first floor, looking on the street, and was meant for the
LINE 3: drawing-room. The double doors are in the middle of the back hall; and
LINE 4: persons entering find in the corner to their right two tall file
LINE 5: cabinets at right angles to one another against the walls. In this
LINE 6: corner stands a flat writing-table, on which are a phonograph, a
LINE 7: laryngoscope, a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows, a set of lamp
LINE 8: chimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a gas plug in the
LINE 9: wall by an indiarubber tube, several tuning-forks of different sizes, a
LINE 10: life-size image of half a human head, showing in section the vocal
LINE 11: organs, and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the
LINE 12: phonograph.
LINE 13: Further down the room, on the same side, is a fireplace, with a
LINE 14: comfortable leather-covered easy-chair at the side of the hearth
LINE 15: nearest the door, and a coal-scuttle. There is a clock on the
LINE 16: mantelpiece. Between the fireplace and the phonograph table is a stand
LINE 17: for newspapers.
LINE 18: On the other side of the central door, to the left of the visitor, is a
LINE 19: cabinet of shallow drawers. On it is a telephone and the telephone
LINE 20: directory. The corner beyond, and most of the side wall, is occupied by
LINE 21: a grand piano, with the keyboard at the end furthest from the door, and
LINE 22: a bench for the player extending the full length of the keyboard. On
LINE 23: the piano is a dessert dish heaped with fruit and sweets, mostly
LINE 24: chocolates.
LINE 25: The middle of the room is clear. Besides the easy chair, the piano
LINE 26: bench, and two chairs at the phonograph table, there is one stray
LINE 27: chair. It stands near the fireplace. On the walls, engravings; mostly
LINE 28: Piranesis and mezzotint portraits. No paintings.
LINE 29: Pickering is seated at the table, putting down some cards and a
LINE 30: tuning-fork which he has been using. Higgins is standing up near him,
LINE 31: closing two or three file drawers which are hanging out. He appears in
LINE 32: the morning light as a robust, vital, appetizing sort of man of forty
LINE 33: or thereabouts, dressed in a professional-looking black frock-coat with
LINE 34: a white linen collar and black silk tie. He is of the energetic,
LINE 35: scientific type, heartily, even violently interested in everything that
LINE 36: can be studied as a scientific subject, and careless about himself and
LINE 37: other people, including their feelings. He is, in fact, but for his
LINE 38: years and size, rather like a very impetuous baby "taking notice"
LINE 39: eagerly and loudly, and requiring almost as much watching to keep him
LINE 40: out of unintended mischief. His manner varies from genial bullying when
LINE 41: he is in a good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong; but
LINE 42: he is so entirely frank and void of malice that he remains likeable
LINE 43: even in his least reasonable moments.
LINE 44: HIGGINS [as he shuts the last drawer] Well, I think that's the whole
LINE 45: show.
LINE 46: PICKERING. It's really amazing. I haven't taken half of it in, you know.
LINE 47: HIGGINS. Would you like to go over any of it again?
LINE 48: PICKERING [rising and coming to the fireplace, where he plants himself
LINE 49: with his back to the fire] No, thank you; not now. I'm quite done up
LINE 50: for this morning.
LINE 51: HIGGINS [following him, and standing beside him on his left] Tired of
LINE 52: listening to sounds?
LINE 53: PICKERING. Yes. It's a fearful strain. I rather fancied myself because
LINE 54: I can pronounce twenty-four distinct vowel sounds; but your hundred and
LINE 55: thirty beat me. I can't hear a bit of difference between most of them.
LINE 56: HIGGINS [chuckling, and going over to the piano to eat sweets] Oh, that
LINE 57: comes with practice. You hear no difference at first; but you keep on
LINE 58: listening, and presently you find they're all as different as A from B.
LINE 59: [Mrs. Pearce looks in: she is Higgins's housekeeper] What's the matter?
LINE 60: MRS. PEARCE [hesitating, evidently perplexed] A young woman wants to
LINE 61: see you, sir.
LINE 62: HIGGINS. A young woman! What does she want?
LINE 63: MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, she says you'll be glad to see her when you
LINE 64: know what she's come about. She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common
LINE 65: indeed. I should have sent her away, only I thought perhaps you wanted
LINE 66: her to talk into your machines. I hope I've not done wrong; but really
LINE 67: you see such queer people sometimes—you'll excuse me, I'm sure, sir—
LINE 68: HIGGINS. Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Pearce. Has she an interesting
LINE 69: accent?
LINE 70: MRS. PEARCE. Oh, something dreadful, sir, really. I don't know how you
LINE 71: can take an interest in it.
LINE 72: HIGGINS [to Pickering] Let's have her up. Show her up, Mrs. Pearce [he
LINE 73: rushes across to his working table and picks out a cylinder to use on
LINE 74: the phonograph].
LINE 75: MRS. PEARCE [only half resigned to it] Very well, sir. It's for you to
LINE 76: say. [She goes downstairs].
LINE 77: HIGGINS. This is rather a bit of luck. I'll show you how I make
LINE 78: records. We'll set her talking; and I'll take it down first in Bell's
LINE 79: visible Speech; then in broad Romic; and then we'll get her on the
LINE 80: phonograph so that you can turn her on as often as you like with the
LINE 81: written transcript before you.
LINE 82: MRS. PEARCE [returning] This is the young woman, sir.
LINE 83: The flower girl enters in state. She has a hat with three ostrich
LINE 84: feathers, orange, sky-blue, and red. She has a nearly clean apron, and
LINE 85: the shoddy coat has been tidied a little. The pathos of this deplorable
LINE 86: figure, with its innocent vanity and consequential air, touches
LINE 87: Pickering, who has already straightened himself in the presence of Mrs.
LINE 88: Pearce. But as to Higgins, the only distinction he makes between men
LINE 89: and women is that when he is neither bullying nor exclaiming to the
LINE 90: heavens against some featherweight cross, he coaxes women as a child
LINE 91: coaxes its nurse when it wants to get anything out of her.
LINE 92: HIGGINS [brusquely, recognizing her with unconcealed disappointment,
LINE 93: and at once, baby-like, making an intolerable grievance of it] Why,
LINE 94: this is the girl I jotted down last night. She's no use: I've got all
LINE 95: the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo; and I'm not going to
LINE 96: waste another cylinder on it. [To the girl] Be off with you: I don't
LINE 97: want you.
LINE 98: THE FLOWER GIRL. Don't you be so saucy. You ain't heard what I come for
LINE 99: yet. [To Mrs. Pearce, who is waiting at the door for further
LINE 100: instruction] Did you tell him I come in a taxi?
LINE 101: MRS. PEARCE. Nonsense, girl! what do you think a gentleman like Mr.
LINE 102: Higgins cares what you came in?
LINE 103: THE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, we are proud! He ain't above giving lessons, not
LINE 104: him: I heard him say so. Well, I ain't come here to ask for any
LINE 105: compliment; and if my money's not good enough I can go elsewhere.
LINE 106: HIGGINS. Good enough for what?
LINE 107: THE FLOWER GIRL. Good enough for ye—oo. Now you know, don't you? I'm
LINE 108: come to have lessons, I am. And to pay for em too: make no mistake.
LINE 109: HIGGINS [stupent] WELL!!! [Recovering his breath with a gasp] What do
LINE 110: you expect me to say to you?
LINE 111: THE FLOWER GIRL. Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit
LINE 112: down, I think. Don't I tell you I'm bringing you business?
LINE 113: HIGGINS. Pickering: shall we ask this baggage to sit down or shall we
LINE 114: throw her out of the window?
LINE 115: THE FLOWER GIRL [running away in terror to the piano, where she turns
LINE 116: at bay] Ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—ow—oo! [Wounded and whimpering] I won't be
LINE 117: called a baggage when I've offered to pay like any lady.
LINE 118: Motionless, the two men stare at her from the other side of the room,
LINE 119: amazed.
LINE 120: PICKERING [gently] What is it you want, my girl?
LINE 121: THE FLOWER GIRL. I want to be a lady in a flower shop stead of selling
LINE 122: at the corner of Tottenham Court Road. But they won't take me unless I
LINE 123: can talk more genteel. He said he could teach me. Well, here I am ready
LINE 124: to pay him—not asking any favor—and he treats me as if I was dirt.
LINE 125: MRS. PEARCE. How can you be such a foolish ignorant girl as to think
LINE 126: you could afford to pay Mr. Higgins?
LINE 127: THE FLOWER GIRL. Why shouldn't I? I know what lessons cost as well as
LINE 128: you do; and I'm ready to pay.
LINE 129: HIGGINS. How much?
LINE 130: THE FLOWER GIRL [coming back to him, triumphant] Now you're talking! I
LINE 131: thought you'd come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit
LINE 132: of what you chucked at me last night. [Confidentially] You'd had a drop
LINE 133: in, hadn't you?
LINE 134: HIGGINS [peremptorily] Sit down.
LINE 135: THE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, if you're going to make a compliment of it—
LINE 136: HIGGINS [thundering at her] Sit down.
LINE 137: MRS. PEARCE [severely] Sit down, girl. Do as you're told. [She places
LINE 138: the stray chair near the hearthrug between Higgins and Pickering, and
LINE 139: stands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down].
LINE 140: THE FLOWER GIRL. Ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—oo! [She stands, half rebellious,
LINE 141: half bewildered].
LINE 142: PICKERING [very courteous] Won't you sit down?
LINE 143: LIZA [coyly] Don't mind if I do. [She sits down. Pickering returns to
LINE 144: the hearthrug].
LINE 145: HIGGINS. What's your name?
LINE 146: THE FLOWER GIRL. Liza Doolittle.
LINE 147: HIGGINS [declaiming gravely]
LINE 148: Eliza, Elizabeth, Betsy and Bess,
LINE 149: They went to the woods to get a bird's nes':
LINE 150: PICKERING. They found a nest with four eggs in it:
LINE 151: HIGGINS. They took one apiece, and left three in it.
LINE 152: They laugh heartily at their own wit.
LINE 153: LIZA. Oh, don't be silly.
LINE 154: MRS. PEARCE. You mustn't speak to the gentleman like that.
LINE 155: LIZA. Well, why won't he speak sensible to me?
LINE 156: HIGGINS. Come back to business. How much do you propose to pay me for
LINE 157: the lessons?
LINE 158: LIZA. Oh, I know what's right. A lady friend of mine gets French
LINE 159: lessons for eighteenpence an hour from a real French gentleman. Well,
LINE 160: you wouldn't have the face to ask me the same for teaching me my own
LINE 161: language as you would for French; so I won't give more than a shilling.
LINE 162: Take it or leave it.
LINE 163: HIGGINS [walking up and down the room, rattling his keys and his cash
LINE 164: in his pockets] You know, Pickering, if you consider a shilling, not as
LINE 165: a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income, it works
LINE 166: out as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy guineas from a millionaire.
LINE 167: PICKERING. How so?
LINE 168: HIGGINS. Figure it out. A millionaire has about 150 pounds a day. She
LINE 169: earns about half-a-crown.
LINE 170: LIZA [haughtily] Who told you I only—
LINE 171: HIGGINS [continuing] She offers me two-fifths of her day's income for a
LINE 172: lesson. Two-fifths of a millionaire's income for a day would be
LINE 173: somewhere about 60 pounds. It's handsome. By George, it's enormous!
LINE 174: it's the biggest offer I ever had.
LINE 175: LIZA [rising, terrified] Sixty pounds! What are you talking about? I
LINE 176: never offered you sixty pounds. Where would I get—
LINE 177: HIGGINS. Hold your tongue.
LINE 178: LIZA [weeping] But I ain't got sixty pounds. Oh—
LINE 179: MRS. PEARCE. Don't cry, you silly girl. Sit down. Nobody is going to
LINE 180: touch your money.
LINE 181: HIGGINS. Somebody is going to touch you, with a broomstick, if you
LINE 182: don't stop snivelling. Sit down.
LINE 183: LIZA [obeying slowly] Ah—ah—ah—ow—oo—o! One would think you was my
LINE 184: father.
LINE 185: HIGGINS. If I decide to teach you, I'll be worse than two fathers to
LINE 186: you. Here [he offers her his silk handkerchief]!
LINE 187: LIZA. What's this for?
LINE 188: HIGGINS. To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part of your face that feels
LINE 189: moist. Remember: that's your handkerchief; and that's your sleeve.
LINE 190: Don't mistake the one for the other if you wish to become a lady in a
LINE 191: shop.
LINE 192: Liza, utterly bewildered, stares helplessly at him.
LINE 193: MRS. PEARCE. It's no use talking to her like that, Mr. Higgins: she
LINE 194: doesn't understand you. Besides, you're quite wrong: she doesn't do it
LINE 195: that way at all [she takes the handkerchief].
LINE 196: LIZA [snatching it] Here! You give me that handkerchief. He give it to
LINE 197: me, not to you.
LINE 198: PICKERING [laughing] He did. I think it must be regarded as her
LINE 199: property, Mrs. Pearce.
LINE 200: MRS. PEARCE [resigning herself] Serve you right, Mr. Higgins.
LINE 201: PICKERING. Higgins: I'm interested. What about the ambassador's garden
LINE 202: party? I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you make that
LINE 203: good. I'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment you can't do it.
LINE 204: And I'll pay for the lessons.
LINE 205: LIZA. Oh, you are real good. Thank you, Captain.
LINE 206: HIGGINS [tempted, looking at her] It's almost irresistible. She's so
LINE 207: deliciously low—so horribly dirty—
LINE 208: LIZA [protesting extremely] Ah—ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—oooo!!! I ain't
LINE 209: dirty: I washed my face and hands afore I come, I did.
LINE 210: PICKERING. You're certainly not going to turn her head with flattery,
LINE 211: Higgins.
LINE 212: MRS. PEARCE [uneasy] Oh, don't say that, sir: there's more ways than
LINE 213: one of turning a girl's head; and nobody can do it better than Mr.
LINE 214: Higgins, though he may not always mean it. I do hope, sir, you won't
LINE 215: encourage him to do anything foolish.
LINE 216: HIGGINS [becoming excited as the idea grows on him] What is life but a
LINE 217: series of inspired follies? The difficulty is to find them to do. Never
LINE 218: lose a chance: it doesn't come every day. I shall make a duchess of
LINE 219: this draggletailed guttersnipe.
LINE 220: LIZA [strongly deprecating this view of her] Ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—oo!
LINE 221: HIGGINS [carried away] Yes: in six months—in three if she has a good
LINE 222: ear and a quick tongue—I'll take her anywhere and pass her off as
LINE 223: anything. We'll start today: now! this moment! Take her away and clean
LINE 224: her, Mrs. Pearce. Monkey Brand, if it won't come off any other way. Is
LINE 225: there a good fire in the kitchen?
LINE 226: MRS. PEARCE [protesting]. Yes; but—
LINE 227: HIGGINS [storming on] Take all her clothes off and burn them. Ring up
LINE 228: Whiteley or somebody for new ones. Wrap her up in brown paper till they
LINE 229: come.
LINE 230: LIZA. You're no gentleman, you're not, to talk of such things. I'm a
LINE 231: good girl, I am; and I know what the like of you are, I do.
LINE 232: HIGGINS. We want none of your Lisson Grove prudery here, young woman.
LINE 233: You've got to learn to behave like a duchess. Take her away, Mrs.
LINE 234: Pearce. If she gives you any trouble wallop her.
LINE 235: LIZA [springing up and running between Pickering and Mrs. Pearce for
LINE 236: protection] No! I'll call the police, I will.
LINE 237: MRS. PEARCE. But I've no place to put her.
LINE 238: HIGGINS. Put her in the dustbin.
LINE 239: LIZA. Ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—oo!
LINE 240: PICKERING. Oh come, Higgins! be reasonable.
LINE 241: MRS. PEARCE [resolutely] You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins: really
LINE 242: you must. You can't walk over everybody like this.
LINE 243: Higgins, thus scolded, subsides. The hurricane is succeeded by a zephyr
LINE 244: of amiable surprise.
LINE 245: HIGGINS [with professional exquisiteness of modulation] I walk over
LINE 246: everybody! My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering, I never had the
LINE 247: slightest intention of walking over anyone. All I propose is that we
LINE 248: should be kind to this poor girl. We must help her to prepare and fit
LINE 249: herself for her new station in life. If I did not express myself
LINE 250: clearly it was because I did not wish to hurt her delicacy, or yours.
LINE 251: Liza, reassured, steals back to her chair.
LINE 252: MRS. PEARCE [to Pickering] Well, did you ever hear anything like that,
LINE 253: sir?
LINE 254: PICKERING [laughing heartily] Never, Mrs. Pearce: never.
LINE 255: HIGGINS [patiently] What's the matter?
LINE 256: MRS. PEARCE. Well, the matter is, sir, that you can't take a girl up
LINE 257: like that as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach.
LINE 258: HIGGINS. Why not?
LINE 259: MRS. PEARCE. Why not! But you don't know anything about her. What about
LINE 260: her parents? She may be married.
LINE 261: LIZA. Garn!
LINE 262: HIGGINS. There! As the girl very properly says, Garn! Married indeed!
LINE 263: Don't you know that a woman of that class looks a worn out drudge of
LINE 264: fifty a year after she's married.
LINE 265: LIZA. Who'd marry me?
LINE 266: HIGGINS [suddenly resorting to the most thrillingly beautiful low tones
LINE 267: in his best elocutionary style] By George, Eliza, the streets will be
LINE 268: strewn with the bodies of men shooting themselves for your sake before
LINE 269: I've done with you.
LINE 270: MRS. PEARCE. Nonsense, sir. You mustn't talk like that to her.
LINE 271: LIZA [rising and squaring herself determinedly] I'm going away. He's
LINE 272: off his chump, he is. I don't want no balmies teaching me.
LINE 273: HIGGINS [wounded in his tenderest point by her insensibility to his
LINE 274: elocution] Oh, indeed! I'm mad, am I? Very well, Mrs. Pearce: you
LINE 275: needn't order the new clothes for her. Throw her out.
LINE 276: LIZA [whimpering] Nah—ow. You got no right to touch me.
LINE 277: MRS. PEARCE. You see now what comes of being saucy. [Indicating the
LINE 278: door] This way, please.
LINE 279: LIZA [almost in tears] I didn't want no clothes. I wouldn't have taken
LINE 280: them [she throws away the handkerchief]. I can buy my own clothes.
LINE 281: HIGGINS [deftly retrieving the handkerchief and intercepting her on her
LINE 282: reluctant way to the door] You're an ungrateful wicked girl. This is my
LINE 283: return for offering to take you out of the gutter and dress you
LINE 284: beautifully and make a lady of you.
LINE 285: MRS. PEARCE. Stop, Mr. Higgins. I won't allow it. It's you that are
LINE 286: wicked. Go home to your parents, girl; and tell them to take better
LINE 287: care of you.
LINE 288: LIZA. I ain't got no parents. They told me I was big enough to earn my
LINE 289: own living and turned me out.
LINE 290: MRS. PEARCE. Where's your mother?
LINE 291: LIZA. I ain't got no mother. Her that turned me out was my sixth
LINE 292: stepmother. But I done without them. And I'm a good girl, I am.
LINE 293: HIGGINS. Very well, then, what on earth is all this fuss about? The
LINE 294: girl doesn't belong to anybody—is no use to anybody but me. [He goes
LINE 295: to Mrs. Pearce and begins coaxing]. You can adopt her, Mrs. Pearce: I'm
LINE 296: sure a daughter would be a great amusement to you. Now don't make any
LINE 297: more fuss. Take her downstairs; and—
LINE 298: MRS. PEARCE. But what's to become of her? Is she to be paid anything?
LINE 299: Do be sensible, sir.
LINE 300: HIGGINS. Oh, pay her whatever is necessary: put it down in the
LINE 301: housekeeping book. [Impatiently] What on earth will she want with
LINE 302: money? She'll have her food and her clothes. She'll only drink if you
LINE 303: give her money.
LINE 304: LIZA [turning on him] Oh you are a brute. It's a lie: nobody ever saw
LINE 305: the sign of liquor on me. [She goes back to her chair and plants
LINE 306: herself there defiantly].
LINE 307: PICKERING [in good-humored remonstrance] Does it occur to you, Higgins,
LINE 308: that the girl has some feelings?
LINE 309: HIGGINS [looking critically at her] Oh no, I don't think so. Not any
LINE 310: feelings that we need bother about. [Cheerily] Have you, Eliza?
LINE 311: LIZA. I got my feelings same as anyone else.
LINE 312: HIGGINS [to Pickering, reflectively] You see the difficulty?
LINE 313: PICKERING. Eh? What difficulty?
LINE 314: HIGGINS. To get her to talk grammar. The mere pronunciation is easy
LINE 315: enough.
LINE 316: LIZA. I don't want to talk grammar. I want to talk like a lady.
LINE 317: MRS. PEARCE. Will you please keep to the point, Mr. Higgins. I want to
LINE 318: know on what terms the girl is to be here. Is she to have any wages?
LINE 319: And what is to become of her when you've finished your teaching? You
LINE 320: must look ahead a little.
LINE 321: HIGGINS [impatiently] What's to become of her if I leave her in the
LINE 322: gutter? Tell me that, Mrs. Pearce.
LINE 323: MRS. PEARCE. That's her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins.
LINE 324: HIGGINS. Well, when I've done with her, we can throw her back into the
LINE 325: gutter; and then it will be her own business again; so that's all right.
LINE 326: LIZA. Oh, you've no feeling heart in you: you don't care for nothing
LINE 327: but yourself [she rises and takes the floor resolutely]. Here! I've had
LINE 328: enough of this. I'm going [making for the door]. You ought to be
LINE 329: ashamed of yourself, you ought.
LINE 330: HIGGINS [snatching a chocolate cream from the piano, his eyes suddenly
LINE 331: beginning to twinkle with mischief] Have some chocolates, Eliza.
LINE 332: LIZA [halting, tempted] How do I know what might be in them? I've heard
LINE 333: of girls being drugged by the like of you.
LINE 334: Higgins whips out his penknife; cuts a chocolate in two; puts one half
LINE 335: into his mouth and bolts it; and offers her the other half.
LINE 336: HIGGINS. Pledge of good faith, Eliza. I eat one half you eat the other.
LINE 337: [Liza opens her mouth to retort: he pops the half chocolate into it].
LINE 338: You shall have boxes of them, barrels of them, every day. You shall
LINE 339: live on them. Eh?
LINE 340: LIZA [who has disposed of the chocolate after being nearly choked by
LINE 341: it] I wouldn't have ate it, only I'm too ladylike to take it out of my
LINE 342: mouth.
LINE 343: HIGGINS. Listen, Eliza. I think you said you came in a taxi.
LINE 344: LIZA. Well, what if I did? I've as good a right to take a taxi as
LINE 345: anyone else.
LINE 346: HIGGINS. You have, Eliza; and in future you shall have as many taxis as
LINE 347: you want. You shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every
LINE 348: day. Think of that, Eliza.
LINE 349: MRS. PEARCE. Mr. Higgins: you're tempting the girl. It's not right. She
LINE 350: should think of the future.
LINE 351: HIGGINS. At her age! Nonsense! Time enough to think of the future when
LINE 352: you haven't any future to think of. No, Eliza: do as this lady does:
LINE 353: think of other people's futures; but never think of your own. Think of
LINE 354: chocolates, and taxis, and gold, and diamonds.
LINE 355: LIZA. No: I don't want no gold and no diamonds. I'm a good girl, I am.
LINE 356: [She sits down again, with an attempt at dignity].
LINE 357: HIGGINS. You shall remain so, Eliza, under the care of Mrs. Pearce. And
LINE 358: you shall marry an officer in the Guards, with a beautiful moustache:
LINE 359: the son of a marquis, who will disinherit him for marrying you, but
LINE 360: will relent when he sees your beauty and goodness—
LINE 361: PICKERING. Excuse me, Higgins; but I really must interfere. Mrs. Pearce
LINE 362: is quite right. If this girl is to put herself in your hands for six
LINE 363: months for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly
LINE 364: what she's doing.
LINE 365: HIGGINS. How can she? She's incapable of understanding anything.
LINE 366: Besides, do any of us understand what we are doing? If we did, would we
LINE 367: ever do it?
LINE 368: PICKERING. Very clever, Higgins; but not sound sense. [To Eliza] Miss
LINE 369: Doolittle—
LINE 370: LIZA [overwhelmed] Ah—ah—ow—oo!
LINE 371: HIGGINS. There! That's all you get out of Eliza. Ah—ah—ow—oo! No use
LINE 372: explaining. As a military man you ought to know that. Give her her
LINE 373: orders: that's what she wants. Eliza: you are to live here for the next
LINE 374: six months, learning how to speak beautifully, like a lady in a
LINE 375: florist's shop. If you're good and do whatever you're told, you shall
LINE 376: sleep in a proper bedroom, and have lots to eat, and money to buy
LINE 377: chocolates and take rides in taxis. If you're naughty and idle you will
LINE 378: sleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles, and be walloped by
LINE 379: Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick. At the end of six months you shall go to
LINE 380: Buckingham Palace in a carriage, beautifully dressed. If the King finds
LINE 381: out you're not a lady, you will be taken by the police to the Tower of
LINE 382: London, where your head will be cut off as a warning to other
LINE 383: presumptuous flower girls. If you are not found out, you shall have a
LINE 384: present of seven-and-sixpence to start life with as a lady in a shop.
LINE 385: If you refuse this offer you will be a most ungrateful and wicked girl;
LINE 386: and the angels will weep for you. [To Pickering] Now are you satisfied,
LINE 387: Pickering? [To Mrs. Pearce] Can I put it more plainly and fairly, Mrs.
LINE 388: Pearce?
LINE 389: MRS. PEARCE [patiently] I think you'd better let me speak to the girl
LINE 390: properly in private. I don't know that I can take charge of her or
LINE 391: consent to the arrangement at all. Of course I know you don't mean her
LINE 392: any harm; but when you get what you call interested in people's
LINE 393: accents, you never think or care what may happen to them or you. Come
LINE 394: with me, Eliza.
LINE 395: HIGGINS. That's all right. Thank you, Mrs. Pearce. Bundle her off to
LINE 396: the bath-room.
LINE 397: LIZA [rising reluctantly and suspiciously] You're a great bully, you
LINE 398: are. I won't stay here if I don't like. I won't let nobody wallop me. I
LINE 399: never asked to go to Bucknam Palace, I didn't. I was never in trouble
LINE 400: with the police, not me. I'm a good girl—
LINE 401: MRS. PEARCE. Don't answer back, girl. You don't understand the
LINE 402: gentleman. Come with me. [She leads the way to the door, and holds it
LINE 403: open for Eliza].
LINE 404: LIZA [as she goes out] Well, what I say is right. I won't go near the
LINE 405: king, not if I'm going to have my head cut off. If I'd known what I was
LINE 406: letting myself in for, I wouldn't have come here. I always been a good
LINE 407: girl; and I never offered to say a word to him; and I don't owe him
LINE 408: nothing; and I don't care; and I won't be put upon; and I have my
LINE 409: feelings the same as anyone else—
LINE 410: Mrs. Pearce shuts the door; and Eliza's plaints are no longer audible.
LINE 411: Pickering comes from the hearth to the chair and sits astride it with
LINE 412: his arms on the back.
LINE 413: PICKERING. Excuse the straight question, Higgins. Are you a man of good
LINE 414: character where women are concerned?
LINE 415: HIGGINS [moodily] Have you ever met a man of good character where women
LINE 416: are concerned?
LINE 417: PICKERING. Yes: very frequently.
LINE 418: HIGGINS [dogmatically, lifting himself on his hands to the level of the
LINE 419: piano, and sitting on it with a bounce] Well, I haven't. I find that
LINE 420: the moment I let a woman make friends with me, she becomes jealous,
LINE 421: exacting, suspicious, and a damned nuisance. I find that the moment I
LINE 422: let myself make friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical.
LINE 423: Women upset everything. When you let them into your life, you find that
LINE 424: the woman is driving at one thing and you're driving at another.
LINE 425: PICKERING. At what, for example?
LINE 426: HIGGINS [coming off the piano restlessly] Oh, Lord knows! I suppose the
LINE 427: woman wants to live her own life; and the man wants to live his; and
LINE 428: each tries to drag the other on to the wrong track. One wants to go
LINE 429: north and the other south; and the result is that both have to go east,
LINE 430: though they both hate the east wind. [He sits down on the bench at the
LINE 431: keyboard]. So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor, and likely to remain
LINE 432: so.
LINE 433: PICKERING [rising and standing over him gravely] Come, Higgins! You
LINE 434: know what I mean. If I'm to be in this business I shall feel
LINE 435: responsible for that girl. I hope it's understood that no advantage is
LINE 436: to be taken of her position.
LINE 437: HIGGINS. What! That thing! Sacred, I assure you. [Rising to explain]
LINE 438: You see, she'll be a pupil; and teaching would be impossible unless
LINE 439: pupils were sacred. I've taught scores of American millionairesses how
LINE 440: to speak English: the best looking women in the world. I'm seasoned.
LINE 441: They might as well be blocks of wood. I might as well be a block of
LINE 442: wood. It's—
LINE 443: Mrs. Pearce opens the door. She has Eliza's hat in her hand. Pickering
LINE 444: retires to the easy-chair at the hearth and sits down.
LINE 445: HIGGINS [eagerly] Well, Mrs. Pearce: is it all right?
LINE 446: MRS. PEARCE [at the door] I just wish to trouble you with a word, if I
LINE 447: may, Mr. Higgins.
LINE 448: HIGGINS. Yes, certainly. Come in. [She comes forward]. Don't burn that,
LINE 449: Mrs. Pearce. I'll keep it as a curiosity. [He takes the hat].
LINE 450: MRS. PEARCE. Handle it carefully, sir, please. I had to promise her not
LINE 451: to burn it; but I had better put it in the oven for a while.
LINE 452: HIGGINS [putting it down hastily on the piano] Oh! thank you. Well,
LINE 453: what have you to say to me?
LINE 454: PICKERING. Am I in the way?
LINE 455: MRS. PEARCE. Not at all, sir. Mr. Higgins: will you please be very
LINE 456: particular what you say before the girl?
LINE 457: HIGGINS [sternly] Of course. I'm always particular about what I say.
LINE 458: Why do you say this to me?
LINE 459: MRS. PEARCE [unmoved] No, sir: you're not at all particular when you've
LINE 460: mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient. Now it doesn't
LINE 461: matter before me: I'm used to it. But you really must not swear before
LINE 462: the girl.
LINE 463: HIGGINS [indignantly] I swear! [Most emphatically] I never swear. I
LINE 464: detest the habit. What the devil do you mean?
LINE 465: MRS. PEARCE [stolidly] That's what I mean, sir. You swear a great deal
LINE 466: too much. I don't mind your damning and blasting, and what the devil
LINE 467: and where the devil and who the devil—
LINE 468: HIGGINS. Really! Mrs. Pearce: this language from your lips!
LINE 469: MRS. PEARCE [not to be put off]—but there is a certain word I must ask
LINE 470: you not to use. The girl has just used it herself because the bath was
LINE 471: too hot. It begins with the same letter as bath. She knows no better:
LINE 472: she learnt it at her mother's knee. But she must not hear it from your
LINE 473: lips.
LINE 474: HIGGINS [loftily] I cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it,
LINE 475: Mrs. Pearce. [She looks at him steadfastly. He adds, hiding an uneasy
LINE 476: conscience with a judicial air] Except perhaps in a moment of extreme
LINE 477: and justifiable excitement.
LINE 478: MRS. PEARCE. Only this morning, sir, you applied it to your boots, to
LINE 479: the butter, and to the brown bread.
LINE 480: HIGGINS. Oh, that! Mere alliteration, Mrs. Pearce, natural to a poet.
LINE 481: MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, whatever you choose to call it, I beg you not
LINE 482: to let the girl hear you repeat it.
LINE 483: HIGGINS. Oh, very well, very well. Is that all?
LINE 484: MRS. PEARCE. No, sir. We shall have to be very particular with this
LINE 485: girl as to personal cleanliness.
LINE 486: HIGGINS. Certainly. Quite right. Most important.
LINE 487: MRS. PEARCE. I mean not to be slovenly about her dress or untidy in
LINE 488: leaving things about.
LINE 489: HIGGINS [going to her solemnly] Just so. I intended to call your
LINE 490: attention to that [He passes on to Pickering, who is enjoying the
LINE 491: conversation immensely]. It is these little things that matter,
LINE 492: Pickering. Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of
LINE 493: themselves is as true of personal habits as of money. [He comes to
LINE 494: anchor on the hearthrug, with the air of a man in an unassailable
LINE 495: position].
LINE 496: MRS. PEARCE. Yes, sir. Then might I ask you not to come down to
LINE 497: breakfast in your dressing-gown, or at any rate not to use it as a
LINE 498: napkin to the extent you do, sir. And if you would be so good as not to
LINE 499: eat everything off the same plate, and to remember not to put the
LINE 500: porridge saucepan out of your hand on the clean tablecloth, it would be
LINE 501: a better example to the girl. You know you nearly choked yourself with
LINE 502: a fishbone in the jam only last week.
LINE 503: HIGGINS [routed from the hearthrug and drifting back to the piano] I
LINE 504: may do these things sometimes in absence of mind; but surely I don't do
LINE 505: them habitually. [Angrily] By the way: my dressing-gown smells most
LINE 506: damnably of benzine.
LINE 507: MRS. PEARCE. No doubt it does, Mr. Higgins. But if you will wipe your
LINE 508: fingers—
LINE 509: HIGGINS [yelling] Oh very well, very well: I'll wipe them in my hair in
LINE 510: future.
LINE 511: MRS. PEARCE. I hope you're not offended, Mr. Higgins.
LINE 512: HIGGINS [shocked at finding himself thought capable of an unamiable
LINE 513: sentiment] Not at all, not at all. You're quite right, Mrs. Pearce: I
LINE 514: shall be particularly careful before the girl. Is that all?
LINE 515: MRS. PEARCE. No, sir. Might she use some of those Japanese dresses you
LINE 516: brought from abroad? I really can't put her back into her old things.
LINE 517: HIGGINS. Certainly. Anything you like. Is that all?
LINE 518: MRS. PEARCE. Thank you, sir. That's all. [She goes out].
LINE 519: HIGGINS. You know, Pickering, that woman has the most extraordinary
LINE 520: ideas about me. Here I am, a shy, diffident sort of man. I've never
LINE 521: been able to feel really grown-up and tremendous, like other chaps. And
LINE 522: yet she's firmly persuaded that I'm an arbitrary overbearing bossing
LINE 523: kind of person. I can't account for it.
LINE 524: Mrs. Pearce returns.
LINE 525: MRS. PEARCE. If you please, sir, the trouble's beginning already.
LINE 526: There's a dustman downstairs, Alfred Doolittle, wants to see you. He
LINE 527: says you have his daughter here.
LINE 528: PICKERING [rising] Phew! I say! [He retreats to the hearthrug].
LINE 529: HIGGINS [promptly] Send the blackguard up.
LINE 530: MRS. PEARCE. Oh, very well, sir. [She goes out].
LINE 531: PICKERING. He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.
LINE 532: HIGGINS. Nonsense. Of course he's a blackguard.
LINE 533: PICKERING. Whether he is or not, I'm afraid we shall have some trouble
LINE 534: with him.
LINE 535: HIGGINS [confidently] Oh no: I think not. If there's any trouble he
LINE 536: shall have it with me, not I with him. And we are sure to get something
LINE 537: interesting out of him.
LINE 538: PICKERING. About the girl?
LINE 539: HIGGINS. No. I mean his dialect.
LINE 540: PICKERING. Oh!
LINE 541: MRS. PEARCE [at the door] Doolittle, sir. [She admits Doolittle and
LINE 542: retires].
LINE 543: Alfred Doolittle is an elderly but vigorous dustman, clad in the
LINE 544: costume of his profession, including a hat with a back brim covering
LINE 545: his neck and shoulders. He has well marked and rather interesting
LINE 546: features, and seems equally free from fear and conscience. He has a
LINE 547: remarkably expressive voice, the result of a habit of giving vent to
LINE 548: his feelings without reserve. His present pose is that of wounded honor
LINE 549: and stern resolution.
LINE 550: DOOLITTLE [at the door, uncertain which of the two gentlemen is his
LINE 551: man] Professor Higgins?
LINE 552: HIGGINS. Here. Good morning. Sit down.
LINE 553: DOOLITTLE. Morning, Governor. [He sits down magisterially] I come about
LINE 554: a very serious matter, Governor.
LINE 555: HIGGINS [to Pickering] Brought up in Hounslow. Mother Welsh, I should
LINE 556: think. [Doolittle opens his mouth, amazed. Higgins continues] What do
LINE 557: you want, Doolittle?
LINE 558: DOOLITTLE [menacingly] I want my daughter: that's what I want. See?
LINE 559: HIGGINS. Of course you do. You're her father, aren't you? You don't
LINE 560: suppose anyone else wants her, do you? I'm glad to see you have some
LINE 561: spark of family feeling left. She's upstairs. Take her away at once.
LINE 562: DOOLITTLE [rising, fearfully taken aback] What!
LINE 563: HIGGINS. Take her away. Do you suppose I'm going to keep your daughter
LINE 564: for you?
LINE 565: DOOLITTLE [remonstrating] Now, now, look here, Governor. Is this
LINE 566: reasonable? Is it fair to take advantage of a man like this? The girl
LINE 567: belongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in? [He sits down again].
LINE 568: HIGGINS. Your daughter had the audacity to come to my house and ask me
LINE 569: to teach her how to speak properly so that she could get a place in a
LINE 570: flower-shop. This gentleman and my housekeeper have been here all the
LINE 571: time. [Bullying him] How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail
LINE 572: me? You sent her here on purpose.
LINE 573: DOOLITTLE [protesting] No, Governor.
LINE 574: HIGGINS. You must have. How else could you possibly know that she is
LINE 575: here?
LINE 576: DOOLITTLE. Don't take a man up like that, Governor.
LINE 577: HIGGINS. The police shall take you up. This is a plant—a plot to
LINE 578: extort money by threats. I shall telephone for the police [he goes
LINE 579: resolutely to the telephone and opens the directory].
LINE 580: DOOLITTLE. Have I asked you for a brass farthing? I leave it to the
LINE 581: gentleman here: have I said a word about money?
LINE 582: HIGGINS [throwing the book aside and marching down on Doolittle with a
LINE 583: poser] What else did you come for?
LINE 584: DOOLITTLE [sweetly] Well, what would a man come for? Be human, governor.
LINE 585: HIGGINS [disarmed] Alfred: did you put her up to it?
LINE 586: DOOLITTLE. So help me, Governor, I never did. I take my Bible oath I
LINE 587: ain't seen the girl these two months past.
LINE 588: HIGGINS. Then how did you know she was here?
LINE 589: DOOLITTLE ["most musical, most melancholy"] I'll tell you, Governor, if
LINE 590: you'll only let me get a word in. I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
LINE 591: to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.
LINE 592: HIGGINS. Pickering: this chap has a certain natural gift of rhetoric.
LINE 593: Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild. "I'm willing to tell
LINE 594: you: I'm wanting to tell you: I'm waiting to tell you." Sentimental
LINE 595: rhetoric! That's the Welsh strain in him. It also accounts for his
LINE 596: mendacity and dishonesty.
LINE 597: PICKERING. Oh, PLEASE, Higgins: I'm west country myself. [To Doolittle]
LINE 598: How did you know the girl was here if you didn't send her?
LINE 599: DOOLITTLE. It was like this, Governor. The girl took a boy in the taxi
LINE 600: to give him a jaunt. Son of her landlady, he is. He hung about on the
LINE 601: chance of her giving him another ride home. Well, she sent him back for
LINE 602: her luggage when she heard you was willing for her to stop here. I met
LINE 603: the boy at the corner of Long Acre and Endell Street.
LINE 604: HIGGINS. Public house. Yes?
LINE 605: DOOLITTLE. The poor man's club, Governor: why shouldn't I?
LINE 606: PICKERING. Do let him tell his story, Higgins.
LINE 607: DOOLITTLE. He told me what was up. And I ask you, what was my feelings
LINE 608: and my duty as a father? I says to the boy, "You bring me the luggage,"
LINE 609: I says—
LINE 610: PICKERING. Why didn't you go for it yourself?
LINE 611: DOOLITTLE. Landlady wouldn't have trusted me with it, Governor. She's
LINE 612: that kind of woman: you know. I had to give the boy a penny afore he
LINE 613: trusted me with it, the little swine. I brought it to her just to
LINE 614: oblige you like, and make myself agreeable. That's all.
LINE 615: HIGGINS. How much luggage?
LINE 616: DOOLITTLE. Musical instrument, Governor. A few pictures, a trifle of
LINE 617: jewelry, and a bird-cage. She said she didn't want no clothes. What was
LINE 618: I to think from that, Governor? I ask you as a parent what was I to
LINE 619: think?
LINE 620: HIGGINS. So you came to rescue her from worse than death, eh?
LINE 621: DOOLITTLE [appreciatively: relieved at being understood] Just so,
LINE 622: Governor. That's right.
LINE 623: PICKERING. But why did you bring her luggage if you intended to take
LINE 624: her away?
LINE 625: DOOLITTLE. Have I said a word about taking her away? Have I now?
LINE 626: HIGGINS [determinedly] You're going to take her away, double quick. [He
LINE 627: crosses to the hearth and rings the bell].
LINE 628: DOOLITTLE [rising] No, Governor. Don't say that. I'm not the man to
LINE 629: stand in my girl's light. Here's a career opening for her, as you might
LINE 630: say; and—
LINE 631: Mrs. Pearce opens the door and awaits orders.
LINE 632: HIGGINS. Mrs. Pearce: this is Eliza's father. He has come to take her
LINE 633: away. Give her to him. [He goes back to the piano, with an air of
LINE 634: washing his hands of the whole affair].
LINE 635: DOOLITTLE. No. This is a misunderstanding. Listen here—
LINE 636: MRS. PEARCE. He can't take her away, Mr. Higgins: how can he? You told
LINE 637: me to burn her clothes.
LINE 638: DOOLITTLE. That's right. I can't carry the girl through the streets
LINE 639: like a blooming monkey, can I? I put it to you.
LINE 640: HIGGINS. You have put it to me that you want your daughter. Take your
LINE 641: daughter. If she has no clothes go out and buy her some.
LINE 642: DOOLITTLE [desperate] Where's the clothes she come in? Did I burn them
LINE 643: or did your missus here?
LINE 644: MRS. PEARCE. I am the housekeeper, if you please. I have sent for some
LINE 645: clothes for your girl. When they come you can take her away. You can
LINE 646: wait in the kitchen. This way, please.
LINE 647: Doolittle, much troubled, accompanies her to the door; then hesitates;
LINE 648: finally turns confidentially to Higgins.
LINE 649: DOOLITTLE. Listen here, Governor. You and me is men of the world, ain't
LINE 650: we?
LINE 651: HIGGINS. Oh! Men of the world, are we? You'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.
LINE 652: MRS. PEARCE. I think so, indeed, sir. [She goes, with dignity].
LINE 653: PICKERING. The floor is yours, Mr. Doolittle.
LINE 654: DOOLITTLE [to Pickering] I thank you, Governor. [To Higgins, who takes
LINE 655: refuge on the piano bench, a little overwhelmed by the proximity of his
LINE 656: visitor; for Doolittle has a professional flavor of dust about him].
LINE 657: Well, the truth is, I've taken a sort of fancy to you, Governor; and if
LINE 658: you want the girl, I'm not so set on having her back home again but
LINE 659: what I might be open to an arrangement. Regarded in the light of a
LINE 660: young woman, she's a fine handsome girl. As a daughter she's not worth
LINE 661: her keep; and so I tell you straight. All I ask is my rights as a
LINE 662: father; and you're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for
LINE 663: nothing; for I can see you're one of the straight sort, Governor. Well,
LINE 664: what's a five pound note to you? And what's Eliza to me? [He returns to
LINE 665: his chair and sits down judicially].
LINE 666: PICKERING. I think you ought to know, Doolittle, that Mr. Higgins's
LINE 667: intentions are entirely honorable.
LINE 668: DOOLITTLE. Course they are, Governor. If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask
LINE 669: fifty.
LINE 670: HIGGINS [revolted] Do you mean to say, you callous rascal, that you
LINE 671: would sell your daughter for 50 pounds?
LINE 672: DOOLITTLE. Not in a general way I wouldn't; but to oblige a gentleman
LINE 673: like you I'd do a good deal, I do assure you.
LINE 674: PICKERING. Have you no morals, man?
LINE 675: DOOLITTLE [unabashed] Can't afford them, Governor. Neither could you if
LINE 676: you was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, you know. But if Liza
LINE 677: is going to have a bit out of this, why not me too?
LINE 678: HIGGINS [troubled] I don't know what to do, Pickering. There can be no
LINE 679: question that as a matter of morals it's a positive crime to give this
LINE 680: chap a farthing. And yet I feel a sort of rough justice in his claim.
LINE 681: DOOLITTLE. That's it, Governor. That's all I say. A father's heart, as
LINE 682: it were.
LINE 683: PICKERING. Well, I know the feeling; but really it seems hardly right—
LINE 684: DOOLITTLE. Don't say that, Governor. Don't look at it that way. What am
LINE 685: I, Governors both? I ask you, what am I? I'm one of the undeserving
LINE 686: poor: that's what I am. Think of what that means to a man. It means
LINE 687: that he's up agen middle class morality all the time. If there's
LINE 688: anything going, and I put in for a bit of it, it's always the same
LINE 689: story: "You're undeserving; so you can't have it." But my needs is as
LINE 690: great as the most deserving widow's that ever got money out of six
LINE 691: different charities in one week for the death of the same husband. I
LINE 692: don't need less than a deserving man: I need more. I don't eat less
LINE 693: hearty than him; and I drink a lot more. I want a bit of amusement,
LINE 694: cause I'm a thinking man. I want cheerfulness and a song and a band
LINE 695: when I feel low. Well, they charge me just the same for everything as
LINE 696: they charge the deserving. What is middle class morality? Just an
LINE 697: excuse for never giving me anything. Therefore, I ask you, as two
LINE 698: gentlemen, not to play that game on me. I'm playing straight with you.
LINE 699: I ain't pretending to be deserving. I'm undeserving; and I mean to go
LINE 700: on being undeserving. I like it; and that's the truth. Will you take
LINE 701: advantage of a man's nature to do him out of the price of his own
LINE 702: daughter what he's brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his
LINE 703: brow until she's growed big enough to be interesting to you two
LINE 704: gentlemen? Is five pounds unreasonable? I put it to you; and I leave it
LINE 705: to you.
LINE 706: HIGGINS [rising, and going over to Pickering] Pickering: if we were to
LINE 707: take this man in hand for three months, he could choose between a seat
LINE 708: in the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.
LINE 709: PICKERING. What do you say to that, Doolittle?
LINE 710: DOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, thank you kindly. I've heard all the
LINE 711: preachers and all the prime ministers—for I'm a thinking man and game
LINE 712: for politics or religion or social reform same as all the other
LINE 713: amusements—and I tell you it's a dog's life anyway you look at it.
LINE 714: Undeserving poverty is my line. Taking one station in society with
LINE 715: another, it's—it's—well, it's the only one that has any ginger in it,
LINE 716: to my taste.
LINE 717: HIGGINS. I suppose we must give him a fiver.
LINE 718: PICKERING. He'll make a bad use of it, I'm afraid.
LINE 719: DOOLITTLE. Not me, Governor, so help me I won't. Don't you be afraid
LINE 720: that I'll save it and spare it and live idle on it. There won't be a
LINE 721: penny of it left by Monday: I'll have to go to work same as if I'd
LINE 722: never had it. It won't pauperize me, you bet. Just one good spree for
LINE 723: myself and the missus, giving pleasure to ourselves and employment to
LINE 724: others, and satisfaction to you to think it's not been throwed away.
LINE 725: You couldn't spend it better.
LINE 726: HIGGINS [taking out his pocket book and coming between Doolittle and
LINE 727: the piano] This is irresistible. Let's give him ten. [He offers two
LINE 728: notes to the dustman].
LINE 729: DOOLITTLE. No, Governor. She wouldn't have the heart to spend ten; and
LINE 730: perhaps I shouldn't neither. Ten pounds is a lot of money: it makes a
LINE 731: man feel prudent like; and then goodbye to happiness. You give me what
LINE 732: I ask you, Governor: not a penny more, and not a penny less.
LINE 733: PICKERING. Why don't you marry that missus of yours? I rather draw the
LINE 734: line at encouraging that sort of immorality.
LINE 735: DOOLITTLE. Tell her so, Governor: tell her so. I'm willing. It's me
LINE 736: that suffers by it. I've no hold on her. I got to be agreeable to her.
LINE 737: I got to give her presents. I got to buy her clothes something sinful.
LINE 738: I'm a slave to that woman, Governor, just because I'm not her lawful
LINE 739: husband. And she knows it too. Catch her marrying me! Take my advice,
LINE 740: Governor: marry Eliza while she's young and don't know no better. If
LINE 741: you don't you'll be sorry for it after. If you do, she'll be sorry for
LINE 742: it after; but better you than her, because you're a man, and she's only
LINE 743: a woman and don't know how to be happy anyhow.
LINE 744: HIGGINS. Pickering: if we listen to this man another minute, we shall
LINE 745: have no convictions left. [To Doolittle] Five pounds I think you said.
LINE 746: DOOLITTLE. Thank you kindly, Governor.
LINE 747: HIGGINS. You're sure you won't take ten?
LINE 748: DOOLITTLE. Not now. Another time, Governor.
LINE 749: HIGGINS [handing him a five-pound note] Here you are.
LINE 750: DOOLITTLE. Thank you, Governor. Good morning.
LINE 751: [He hurries to the door, anxious to get away with his booty. When he
LINE 752: opens it he is confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young
LINE 753: Japanese lady in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with
LINE 754: small white jasmine blossoms. Mrs. Pearce is with her. He gets out of
LINE 755: her way deferentially and apologizes]. Beg pardon, miss.
LINE 756: THE JAPANESE LADY. Garn! Don't you know your own daughter?
LINE 757: DOOLITTLE {exclaiming Bly me! it's Eliza!
LINE 758: HIGGINS {simul- What's that! This!
LINE 759: PICKERING {taneously By Jove!
LINE 760: LIZA. Don't I look silly?
LINE 761: HIGGINS. Silly?
LINE 762: MRS. PEARCE [at the door] Now, Mr. Higgins, please don't say anything
LINE 763: to make the girl conceited about herself.
LINE 764: HIGGINS [conscientiously] Oh! Quite right, Mrs. Pearce. [To Eliza] Yes:
LINE 765: damned silly.
LINE 766: MRS. PEARCE. Please, sir.
LINE 767: HIGGINS [correcting himself] I mean extremely silly.
LINE 768: LIZA. I should look all right with my hat on. [She takes up her hat;
LINE 769: puts it on; and walks across the room to the fireplace with a
LINE 770: fashionable air].
LINE 771: HIGGINS. A new fashion, by George! And it ought to look horrible!
LINE 772: DOOLITTLE [with fatherly pride] Well, I never thought she'd clean up as
LINE 773: good looking as that, Governor. She's a credit to me, ain't she?
LINE 774: LIZA. I tell you, it's easy to clean up here. Hot and cold water on
LINE 775: tap, just as much as you like, there is. Woolly towels, there is; and a
LINE 776: towel horse so hot, it burns your fingers. Soft brushes to scrub
LINE 777: yourself, and a wooden bowl of soap smelling like primroses. Now I know
LINE 778: why ladies is so clean. Washing's a treat for them. Wish they saw what
LINE 779: it is for the like of me!
LINE 780: HIGGINS. I'm glad the bath-room met with your approval.
LINE 781: LIZA. It didn't: not all of it; and I don't care who hears me say it.
LINE 782: Mrs. Pearce knows.
LINE 783: HIGGINS. What was wrong, Mrs. Pearce?
LINE 784: MRS. PEARCE [blandly] Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn't matter.
LINE 785: LIZA. I had a good mind to break it. I didn't know which way to look.
LINE 786: But I hung a towel over it, I did.
LINE 787: HIGGINS. Over what?
LINE 788: MRS. PEARCE. Over the looking-glass, sir.
LINE 789: HIGGINS. Doolittle: you have brought your daughter up too strictly.
LINE 790: DOOLITTLE. Me! I never brought her up at all, except to give her a lick
LINE 791: of a strap now and again. Don't put it on me, Governor. She ain't
LINE 792: accustomed to it, you see: that's all. But she'll soon pick up your
LINE 793: free-and-easy ways.
LINE 794: LIZA. I'm a good girl, I am; and I won't pick up no free and easy ways.
LINE 795: HIGGINS. Eliza: if you say again that you're a good girl, your father
LINE 796: shall take you home.
LINE 797: LIZA. Not him. You don't know my father. All he come here for was to
LINE 798: touch you for some money to get drunk on.
LINE 799: DOOLITTLE. Well, what else would I want money for? To put into the
LINE 800: plate in church, I suppose. [She puts out her tongue at him. He is so
LINE 801: incensed by this that Pickering presently finds it necessary to step
LINE 802: between them]. Don't you give me none of your lip; and don't let me
LINE 803: hear you giving this gentleman any of it neither, or you'll hear from
LINE 804: me about it. See?
LINE 805: HIGGINS. Have you any further advice to give her before you go,
LINE 806: Doolittle? Your blessing, for instance.
LINE 807: DOOLITTLE. No, Governor: I ain't such a mug as to put up my children to
LINE 808: all I know myself. Hard enough to hold them in without that. If you
LINE 809: want Eliza's mind improved, Governor, you do it yourself with a strap.
LINE 810: So long, gentlemen. [He turns to go].
LINE 811: HIGGINS [impressively] Stop. You'll come regularly to see your
LINE 812: daughter. It's your duty, you know. My brother is a clergyman; and he
LINE 813: could help you in your talks with her.
LINE 814: DOOLITTLE [evasively] Certainly. I'll come, Governor. Not just this
LINE 815: week, because I have a job at a distance. But later on you may depend
LINE 816: on me. Afternoon, gentlemen. Afternoon, ma'am. [He takes off his hat to
LINE 817: Mrs. Pearce, who disdains the salutation and goes out. He winks at
LINE 818: Higgins, thinking him probably a fellow sufferer from Mrs. Pearce's
LINE 819: difficult disposition, and follows her].
LINE 820: LIZA. Don't you believe the old liar. He'd as soon you set a bull-dog
LINE 821: on him as a clergyman. You won't see him again in a hurry.
LINE 822: HIGGINS. I don't want to, Eliza. Do you?
LINE 823: LIZA. Not me. I don't want never to see him again, I don't. He's a
LINE 824: disgrace to me, he is, collecting dust, instead of working at his trade.
LINE 825: PICKERING. What is his trade, Eliza?
LINE 826: LIZA. Talking money out of other people's pockets into his own. His
LINE 827: proper trade's a navvy; and he works at it sometimes too—for
LINE 828: exercise—and earns good money at it. Ain't you going to call me Miss
LINE 829: Doolittle any more?
LINE 830: PICKERING. I beg your pardon, Miss Doolittle. It was a slip of the
LINE 831: tongue.
LINE 832: LIZA. Oh, I don't mind; only it sounded so genteel. I should just like
LINE 833: to take a taxi to the corner of Tottenham Court Road and get out there
LINE 834: and tell it to wait for me, just to put the girls in their place a bit.
LINE 835: I wouldn't speak to them, you know.
LINE 836: PICKERING. Better wait til we get you something really fashionable.
LINE 837: HIGGINS. Besides, you shouldn't cut your old friends now that you have
LINE 838: risen in the world. That's what we call snobbery.
LINE 839: LIZA. You don't call the like of them my friends now, I should hope.
LINE 840: They've took it out of me often enough with their ridicule when they
LINE 841: had the chance; and now I mean to get a bit of my own back. But if I'm
LINE 842: to have fashionable clothes, I'll wait. I should like to have some.
LINE 843: Mrs. Pearce says you're going to give me some to wear in bed at night
LINE 844: different to what I wear in the daytime; but it do seem a waste of
LINE 845: money when you could get something to show. Besides, I never could
LINE 846: fancy changing into cold things on a winter night.
LINE 847: MRS. PEARCE [coming back] Now, Eliza. The new things have come for you
LINE 848: to try on.
LINE 849: LIZA. Ah—ow—oo—ooh! [She rushes out].
LINE 850: MRS. PEARCE [following her] Oh, don't rush about like that, girl [She
LINE 851: shuts the door behind her].
LINE 852: HIGGINS. Pickering: we have taken on a stiff job.
LINE 853: PICKERING [with conviction] Higgins: we have.
