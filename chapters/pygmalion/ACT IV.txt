LINE 1: The Wimpole Street laboratory. Midnight. Nobody in the room. The clock
LINE 2: on the mantelpiece strikes twelve. The fire is not alight: it is a
LINE 3: summer night.
LINE 4: Presently Higgins and Pickering are heard on the stairs.
LINE 5: HIGGINS [calling down to Pickering] I say, Pick: lock up, will you. I
LINE 6: shan't be going out again.
LINE 7: PICKERING. Right. Can Mrs. Pearce go to bed? We don't want anything
LINE 8: more, do we?
LINE 9: HIGGINS. Lord, no!
LINE 10: Eliza opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak,
LINE 11: brilliant evening dress, and diamonds, with fan, flowers, and all
LINE 12: accessories. She comes to the hearth, and switches on the electric
LINE 13: lights there. She is tired: her pallor contrasts strongly with her dark
LINE 14: eyes and hair; and her expression is almost tragic. She takes off her
LINE 15: cloak; puts her fan and flowers on the piano; and sits down on the
LINE 16: bench, brooding and silent. Higgins, in evening dress, with overcoat
LINE 17: and hat, comes in, carrying a smoking jacket which he has picked up
LINE 18: downstairs. He takes off the hat and overcoat; throws them carelessly
LINE 19: on the newspaper stand; disposes of his coat in the same way; puts on
LINE 20: the smoking jacket; and throws himself wearily into the easy-chair at
LINE 21: the hearth. Pickering, similarly attired, comes in. He also takes off
LINE 22: his hat and overcoat, and is about to throw them on Higgins's when he
LINE 23: hesitates.
LINE 24: PICKERING. I say: Mrs. Pearce will row if we leave these things lying
LINE 25: about in the drawing-room.
LINE 26: HIGGINS. Oh, chuck them over the bannisters into the hall. She'll find
LINE 27: them there in the morning and put them away all right. She'll think we
LINE 28: were drunk.
LINE 29: PICKERING. We are, slightly. Are there any letters?
LINE 30: HIGGINS. I didn't look. [Pickering takes the overcoats and hats and
LINE 31: goes down stairs. Higgins begins half singing half yawning an air from
LINE 32: La Fanciulla del Golden West. Suddenly he stops and exclaims] I wonder
LINE 33: where the devil my slippers are!
LINE 34: Eliza looks at him darkly; then leaves the room.
LINE 35: Higgins yawns again, and resumes his song. Pickering returns, with the
LINE 36: contents of the letter-box in his hand.
LINE 37: PICKERING. Only circulars, and this coroneted billet-doux for you. [He
LINE 38: throws the circulars into the fender, and posts himself on the
LINE 39: hearthrug, with his back to the grate].
LINE 40: HIGGINS [glancing at the billet-doux] Money-lender. [He throws the
LINE 41: letter after the circulars].
LINE 42: Eliza returns with a pair of large down-at-heel slippers. She places
LINE 43: them on the carpet before Higgins, and sits as before without a word.
LINE 44: HIGGINS [yawning again] Oh Lord! What an evening! What a crew! What a
LINE 45: silly tomfoollery! [He raises his shoe to unlace it, and catches sight
LINE 46: of the slippers. He stops unlacing and looks at them as if they had
LINE 47: appeared there of their own accord]. Oh! they're there, are they?
LINE 48: PICKERING [stretching himself] Well, I feel a bit tired. It's been a
LINE 49: long day. The garden party, a dinner party, and the opera! Rather too
LINE 50: much of a good thing. But you've won your bet, Higgins. Eliza did the
LINE 51: trick, and something to spare, eh?
LINE 52: HIGGINS [fervently] Thank God it's over!
LINE 53: Eliza flinches violently; but they take no notice of her; and she
LINE 54: recovers herself and sits stonily as before.
LINE 55: PICKERING. Were you nervous at the garden party? I was. Eliza didn't
LINE 56: seem a bit nervous.
LINE 57: HIGGINS. Oh, she wasn't nervous. I knew she'd be all right. No, it's
LINE 58: the strain of putting the job through all these months that has told on
LINE 59: me. It was interesting enough at first, while we were at the phonetics;
LINE 60: but after that I got deadly sick of it. If I hadn't backed myself to do
LINE 61: it I should have chucked the whole thing up two months ago. It was a
LINE 62: silly notion: the whole thing has been a bore.
LINE 63: PICKERING. Oh come! the garden party was frightfully exciting. My heart
LINE 64: began beating like anything.
LINE 65: HIGGINS. Yes, for the first three minutes. But when I saw we were going
LINE 66: to win hands down, I felt like a bear in a cage, hanging about doing
LINE 67: nothing. The dinner was worse: sitting gorging there for over an hour,
LINE 68: with nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable woman to talk to! I tell
LINE 69: you, Pickering, never again for me. No more artificial duchesses. The
LINE 70: whole thing has been simple purgatory.
LINE 71: PICKERING. You've never been broken in properly to the social routine.
LINE 72: [Strolling over to the piano] I rather enjoy dipping into it
LINE 73: occasionally myself: it makes me feel young again. Anyhow, it was a
LINE 74: great success: an immense success. I was quite frightened once or twice
LINE 75: because Eliza was doing it so well. You see, lots of the real people
LINE 76: can't do it at all: they're such fools that they think style comes by
LINE 77: nature to people in their position; and so they never learn. There's
LINE 78: always something professional about doing a thing superlatively well.
LINE 79: HIGGINS. Yes: that's what drives me mad: the silly people don't know
LINE 80: their own silly business. [Rising] However, it's over and done with;
LINE 81: and now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.
LINE 82: Eliza's beauty becomes murderous.
LINE 83: PICKERING. I think I shall turn in too. Still, it's been a great
LINE 84: occasion: a triumph for you. Good-night. [He goes].
LINE 85: HIGGINS [following him] Good-night. [Over his shoulder, at the door]
LINE 86: Put out the lights, Eliza; and tell Mrs. Pearce not to make coffee for
LINE 87: me in the morning: I'll take tea. [He goes out].
LINE 88: Eliza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises and
LINE 89: walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights. By the time she
LINE 90: gets there she is on the point of screaming. She sits down in Higgins's
LINE 91: chair and holds on hard to the arms. Finally she gives way and flings
LINE 92: herself furiously on the floor raging.
LINE 93: HIGGINS [in despairing wrath outside] What the devil have I done with
LINE 94: my slippers? [He appears at the door].
LINE 95: LIZA [snatching up the slippers, and hurling them at him one after the
LINE 96: other with all her force] There are your slippers. And there. Take your
LINE 97: slippers; and may you never have a day's luck with them!
LINE 98: HIGGINS [astounded] What on earth—! [He comes to her]. What's the
LINE 99: matter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?
LINE 100: LIZA [breathless] Nothing wrong—with YOU. I've won your bet for you,
LINE 101: haven't I? That's enough for you. _I_ don't matter, I suppose.
LINE 102: HIGGINS. YOU won my bet! You! Presumptuous insect! _I_ won it. What did
LINE 103: you throw those slippers at me for?
LINE 104: LIZA. Because I wanted to smash your face. I'd like to kill you, you
LINE 105: selfish brute. Why didn't you leave me where you picked me out of—in
LINE 106: the gutter? You thank God it's all over, and that now you can throw me
LINE 107: back again there, do you? [She crisps her fingers, frantically].
LINE 108: HIGGINS [looking at her in cool wonder] The creature IS nervous, after
LINE 109: all.
LINE 110: LIZA [gives a suffocated scream of fury, and instinctively darts her
LINE 111: nails at his face]!!
LINE 112: HIGGINS [catching her wrists] Ah! would you? Claws in, you cat. How
LINE 113: dare you show your temper to me? Sit down and be quiet. [He throws her
LINE 114: roughly into the easy-chair].
LINE 115: LIZA [crushed by superior strength and weight] What's to become of me?
LINE 116: What's to become of me?
LINE 117: HIGGINS. How the devil do I know what's to become of you? What does it
LINE 118: matter what becomes of you?
LINE 119: LIZA. You don't care. I know you don't care. You wouldn't care if I was
LINE 120: dead. I'm nothing to you—not so much as them slippers.
LINE 121: HIGGINS [thundering] THOSE slippers.
LINE 122: LIZA [with bitter submission] Those slippers. I didn't think it made
LINE 123: any difference now.
LINE 124: A pause. Eliza hopeless and crushed. Higgins a little uneasy.
LINE 125: HIGGINS [in his loftiest manner] Why have you begun going on like this?
LINE 126: May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?
LINE 127: LIZA. No.
LINE 128: HIGGINS. Has anybody behaved badly to you? Colonel Pickering? Mrs.
LINE 129: Pearce? Any of the servants?
LINE 130: LIZA. No.
LINE 131: HIGGINS. I presume you don't pretend that I have treated you badly.
LINE 132: LIZA. No.
LINE 133: HIGGINS. I am glad to hear it. [He moderates his tone]. Perhaps you're
LINE 134: tired after the strain of the day. Will you have a glass of champagne?
LINE 135: [He moves towards the door].
LINE 136: LIZA. No. [Recollecting her manners] Thank you.
LINE 137: HIGGINS [good-humored again] This has been coming on you for some days.
LINE 138: I suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the garden party.
LINE 139: But that's all over now. [He pats her kindly on the shoulder. She
LINE 140: writhes]. There's nothing more to worry about.
LINE 141: LIZA. No. Nothing more for you to worry about. [She suddenly rises and
LINE 142: gets away from him by going to the piano bench, where she sits and
LINE 143: hides her face]. Oh God! I wish I was dead.
LINE 144: HIGGINS [staring after her in sincere surprise] Why? in heaven's name,
LINE 145: why? [Reasonably, going to her] Listen to me, Eliza. All this
LINE 146: irritation is purely subjective.
LINE 147: LIZA. I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.
LINE 148: HIGGINS. It's only imagination. Low spirits and nothing else. Nobody's
LINE 149: hurting you. Nothing's wrong. You go to bed like a good girl and sleep
LINE 150: it off. Have a little cry and say your prayers: that will make you
LINE 151: comfortable.
LINE 152: LIZA. I heard YOUR prayers. "Thank God it's all over!"
LINE 153: HIGGINS [impatiently] Well, don't you thank God it's all over? Now you
LINE 154: are free and can do what you like.
LINE 155: LIZA [pulling herself together in desperation] What am I fit for? What
LINE 156: have you left me fit for? Where am I to go? What am I to do? What's to
LINE 157: become of me?
LINE 158: HIGGINS [enlightened, but not at all impressed] Oh, that's what's
LINE 159: worrying you, is it? [He thrusts his hands into his pockets, and walks
LINE 160: about in his usual manner, rattling the contents of his pockets, as if
LINE 161: condescending to a trivial subject out of pure kindness]. I shouldn't
LINE 162: bother about it if I were you. I should imagine you won't have much
LINE 163: difficulty in settling yourself, somewhere or other, though I hadn't
LINE 164: quite realized that you were going away. [She looks quickly at him: he
LINE 165: does not look at her, but examines the dessert stand on the piano and
LINE 166: decides that he will eat an apple]. You might marry, you know. [He
LINE 167: bites a large piece out of the apple, and munches it noisily]. You see,
LINE 168: Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel.
LINE 169: Most men are the marrying sort (poor devils!); and you're not
LINE 170: bad-looking; it's quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes—not now,
LINE 171: of course, because you're crying and looking as ugly as the very devil;
LINE 172: but when you're all right and quite yourself, you're what I should call
LINE 173: attractive. That is, to the people in the marrying line, you
LINE 174: understand. You go to bed and have a good nice rest; and then get up
LINE 175: and look at yourself in the glass; and you won't feel so cheap.
LINE 176: Eliza again looks at him, speechless, and does not stir.
LINE 177: The look is quite lost on him: he eats his apple with a dreamy
LINE 178: expression of happiness, as it is quite a good one.
LINE 179: HIGGINS [a genial afterthought occurring to him] I daresay my mother
LINE 180: could find some chap or other who would do very well—
LINE 181: LIZA. We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
LINE 182: HIGGINS [waking up] What do you mean?
LINE 183: LIZA. I sold flowers. I didn't sell myself. Now you've made a lady of
LINE 184: me I'm not fit to sell anything else. I wish you'd left me where you
LINE 185: found me.
LINE 186: HIGGINS [slinging the core of the apple decisively into the grate]
LINE 187: Tosh, Eliza. Don't you insult human relations by dragging all this cant
LINE 188: about buying and selling into it. You needn't marry the fellow if you
LINE 189: don't like him.
LINE 190: LIZA. What else am I to do?
LINE 191: HIGGINS. Oh, lots of things. What about your old idea of a florist's
LINE 192: shop? Pickering could set you up in one: he's lots of money.
LINE 193: [Chuckling] He'll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing
LINE 194: today; and that, with the hire of the jewellery, will make a big hole
LINE 195: in two hundred pounds. Why, six months ago you would have thought it
LINE 196: the millennium to have a flower shop of your own. Come! you'll be all
LINE 197: right. I must clear off to bed: I'm devilish sleepy. By the way, I came
LINE 198: down for something: I forget what it was.
LINE 199: LIZA. Your slippers.
LINE 200: HIGGINS. Oh yes, of course. You shied them at me. [He picks them up,
LINE 201: and is going out when she rises and speaks to him].
LINE 202: LIZA. Before you go, sir—
LINE 203: HIGGINS [dropping the slippers in his surprise at her calling him sir]
LINE 204: Eh?
LINE 205: LIZA. Do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?
LINE 206: HIGGINS [coming back into the room as if her question were the very
LINE 207: climax of unreason] What the devil use would they be to Pickering?
LINE 208: LIZA. He might want them for the next girl you pick up to experiment on.
LINE 209: HIGGINS [shocked and hurt] Is THAT the way you feel towards us?
LINE 210: LIZA. I don't want to hear anything more about that. All I want to know
LINE 211: is whether anything belongs to me. My own clothes were burnt.
LINE 212: HIGGINS. But what does it matter? Why need you start bothering about
LINE 213: that in the middle of the night?
LINE 214: LIZA. I want to know what I may take away with me. I don't want to be
LINE 215: accused of stealing.
LINE 216: HIGGINS [now deeply wounded] Stealing! You shouldn't have said that,
LINE 217: Eliza. That shows a want of feeling.
LINE 218: LIZA. I'm sorry. I'm only a common ignorant girl; and in my station I
LINE 219: have to be careful. There can't be any feelings between the like of you
LINE 220: and the like of me. Please will you tell me what belongs to me and what
LINE 221: doesn't?
LINE 222: HIGGINS [very sulky] You may take the whole damned houseful if you
LINE 223: like. Except the jewels. They're hired. Will that satisfy you? [He
LINE 224: turns on his heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon].
LINE 225: LIZA [drinking in his emotion like nectar, and nagging him to provoke a
LINE 226: further supply] Stop, please. [She takes off her jewels]. Will you take
LINE 227: these to your room and keep them safe? I don't want to run the risk of
LINE 228: their being missing.
LINE 229: HIGGINS [furious] Hand them over. [She puts them into his hands]. If
LINE 230: these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I'd ram them down your
LINE 231: ungrateful throat. [He perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets,
LINE 232: unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the
LINE 233: chains].
LINE 234: LIZA [taking a ring off] This ring isn't the jeweler's: it's the one
LINE 235: you bought me in Brighton. I don't want it now. [Higgins dashes the
LINE 236: ring violently into the fireplace, and turns on her so threateningly
LINE 237: that she crouches over the piano with her hands over her face, and
LINE 238: exclaims] Don't you hit me.
LINE 239: HIGGINS. Hit you! You infamous creature, how dare you accuse me of such
LINE 240: a thing? It is you who have hit me. You have wounded me to the heart.
LINE 241: LIZA [thrilling with hidden joy] I'm glad. I've got a little of my own
LINE 242: back, anyhow.
LINE 243: HIGGINS [with dignity, in his finest professional style] You have
LINE 244: caused me to lose my temper: a thing that has hardly ever happened to
LINE 245: me before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to bed.
LINE 246: LIZA [pertly] You'd better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the
LINE 247: coffee; for she won't be told by me.
LINE 248: HIGGINS [formally] Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and damn you;
LINE 249: and damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned knowledge and
LINE 250: the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe. [He
LINE 251: goes out with impressive decorum, and spoils it by slamming the door
LINE 252: savagely].
LINE 253: Eliza smiles for the first time; expresses her feelings by a wild
LINE 254: pantomime in which an imitation of Higgins's exit is confused with her
LINE 255: own triumph; and finally goes down on her knees on the hearthrug to
LINE 256: look for the ring.
