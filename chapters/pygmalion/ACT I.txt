LINE 1: Covent Garden at 11.15 p.m. Torrents of heavy summer rain. Cab whistles
LINE 2: blowing frantically in all directions. Pedestrians running for shelter
LINE 3: into the market and under the portico of St. Paul's Church, where there
LINE 4: are already several people, among them a lady and her daughter in
LINE 5: evening dress. They are all peering out gloomily at the rain, except
LINE 6: one man with his back turned to the rest, who seems wholly preoccupied
LINE 7: with a notebook in which he is writing busily.
LINE 8: The church clock strikes the first quarter.
LINE 9: THE DAUGHTER [in the space between the central pillars, close to the
LINE 10: one on her left] I'm getting chilled to the bone. What can Freddy be
LINE 11: doing all this time? He's been gone twenty minutes.
LINE 12: THE MOTHER [on her daughter's right] Not so long. But he ought to have
LINE 13: got us a cab by this.
LINE 14: A BYSTANDER [on the lady's right] He won't get no cab not until
LINE 15: half-past eleven, missus, when they come back after dropping their
LINE 16: theatre fares.
LINE 17: THE MOTHER. But we must have a cab. We can't stand here until half-past
LINE 18: eleven. It's too bad.
LINE 19: THE BYSTANDER. Well, it ain't my fault, missus.
LINE 20: THE DAUGHTER. If Freddy had a bit of gumption, he would have got one at
LINE 21: the theatre door.
LINE 22: THE MOTHER. What could he have done, poor boy?
LINE 23: THE DAUGHTER. Other people got cabs. Why couldn't he?
LINE 24: Freddy rushes in out of the rain from the Southampton Street side, and
LINE 25: comes between them closing a dripping umbrella. He is a young man of
LINE 26: twenty, in evening dress, very wet around the ankles.
LINE 27: THE DAUGHTER. Well, haven't you got a cab?
LINE 28: FREDDY. There's not one to be had for love or money.
LINE 29: THE MOTHER. Oh, Freddy, there must be one. You can't have tried.
LINE 30: THE DAUGHTER. It's too tiresome. Do you expect us to go and get one
LINE 31: ourselves?
LINE 32: FREDDY. I tell you they're all engaged. The rain was so sudden: nobody
LINE 33: was prepared; and everybody had to take a cab. I've been to Charing
LINE 34: Cross one way and nearly to Ludgate Circus the other; and they were all
LINE 35: engaged.
LINE 36: THE MOTHER. Did you try Trafalgar Square?
LINE 37: FREDDY. There wasn't one at Trafalgar Square.
LINE 38: THE DAUGHTER. Did you try?
LINE 39: FREDDY. I tried as far as Charing Cross Station. Did you expect me to
LINE 40: walk to Hammersmith?
LINE 41: THE DAUGHTER. You haven't tried at all.
LINE 42: THE MOTHER. You really are very helpless, Freddy. Go again; and don't
LINE 43: come back until you have found a cab.
LINE 44: FREDDY. I shall simply get soaked for nothing.
LINE 45: THE DAUGHTER. And what about us? Are we to stay here all night in this
LINE 46: draught, with next to nothing on. You selfish pig—
LINE 47: FREDDY. Oh, very well: I'll go, I'll go. [He opens his umbrella and
LINE 48: dashes off Strandwards, but comes into collision with a flower girl,
LINE 49: who is hurrying in for shelter, knocking her basket out of her hands. A
LINE 50: blinding flash of lightning, followed instantly by a rattling peal of
LINE 51: thunder, orchestrates the incident]
LINE 52: THE FLOWER GIRL. Nah then, Freddy: look wh' y' gowin, deah.
LINE 53: FREDDY. Sorry [he rushes off].
LINE 54: THE FLOWER GIRL [picking up her scattered flowers and replacing them in
LINE 55: the basket] There's menners f' yer! Te-oo banches o voylets trod into
LINE 56: the mad. [She sits down on the plinth of the column, sorting her
LINE 57: flowers, on the lady's right. She is not at all an attractive person.
LINE 58: She is perhaps eighteen, perhaps twenty, hardly older. She wears a
LINE 59: little sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust
LINE 60: and soot of London and has seldom if ever been brushed. Her hair needs
LINE 61: washing rather badly: its mousy color can hardly be natural. She wears
LINE 62: a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to
LINE 63: her waist. She has a brown skirt with a coarse apron. Her boots are
LINE 64: much the worse for wear. She is no doubt as clean as she can afford to
LINE 65: be; but compared to the ladies she is very dirty. Her features are no
LINE 66: worse than theirs; but their condition leaves something to be desired;
LINE 67: and she needs the services of a dentist].
LINE 68: THE MOTHER. How do you know that my son's name is Freddy, pray?
LINE 69: THE FLOWER GIRL. Ow, eez ye-ooa san, is e? Wal, fewd dan y' de-ooty
LINE 70: bawmz a mather should, eed now bettern to spawl a pore gel's flahrzn
LINE 71: than ran awy atbaht pyin. Will ye-oo py me f'them? [Here, with
LINE 72: apologies, this desperate attempt to represent her dialect without a
LINE 73: phonetic alphabet must be abandoned as unintelligible outside London.]
LINE 74: THE DAUGHTER. Do nothing of the sort, mother. The idea!
LINE 75: THE MOTHER. Please allow me, Clara. Have you any pennies?
LINE 76: THE DAUGHTER. No. I've nothing smaller than sixpence.
LINE 77: THE FLOWER GIRL [hopefully] I can give you change for a tanner, kind
LINE 78: lady.
LINE 79: THE MOTHER [to Clara] Give it to me. [Clara parts reluctantly]. Now [to
LINE 80: the girl] This is for your flowers.
LINE 81: THE FLOWER GIRL. Thank you kindly, lady.
LINE 82: THE DAUGHTER. Make her give you the change. These things are only a
LINE 83: penny a bunch.
LINE 84: THE MOTHER. Do hold your tongue, Clara. [To the girl]. You can keep the
LINE 85: change.
LINE 86: THE FLOWER GIRL. Oh, thank you, lady.
LINE 87: THE MOTHER. Now tell me how you know that young gentleman's name.
LINE 88: THE FLOWER GIRL. I didn't.
LINE 89: THE MOTHER. I heard you call him by it. Don't try to deceive me.
LINE 90: THE FLOWER GIRL [protesting] Who's trying to deceive you? I called him
LINE 91: Freddy or Charlie same as you might yourself if you was talking to a
LINE 92: stranger and wished to be pleasant. [She sits down beside her basket].
LINE 93: THE DAUGHTER. Sixpence thrown away! Really, mamma, you might have
LINE 94: spared Freddy that. [She retreats in disgust behind the pillar].
LINE 95: An elderly gentleman of the amiable military type rushes into shelter,
LINE 96: and closes a dripping umbrella. He is in the same plight as Freddy,
LINE 97: very wet about the ankles. He is in evening dress, with a light
LINE 98: overcoat. He takes the place left vacant by the daughter's retirement.
LINE 99: THE GENTLEMAN. Phew!
LINE 100: THE MOTHER [to the gentleman] Oh, sir, is there any sign of its
LINE 101: stopping?
LINE 102: THE GENTLEMAN. I'm afraid not. It started worse than ever about two
LINE 103: minutes ago. [He goes to the plinth beside the flower girl; puts up his
LINE 104: foot on it; and stoops to turn down his trouser ends].
LINE 105: THE MOTHER. Oh, dear! [She retires sadly and joins her daughter].
LINE 106: THE FLOWER GIRL [taking advantage of the military gentleman's proximity
LINE 107: to establish friendly relations with him]. If it's worse it's a sign
LINE 108: it's nearly over. So cheer up, Captain; and buy a flower off a poor
LINE 109: girl.
LINE 110: THE GENTLEMAN. I'm sorry, I haven't any change.
LINE 111: THE FLOWER GIRL. I can give you change, Captain,
LINE 112: THE GENTLEMEN. For a sovereign? I've nothing less.
LINE 113: THE FLOWER GIRL. Garn! Oh do buy a flower off me, Captain. I can change
LINE 114: half-a-crown. Take this for tuppence.
LINE 115: THE GENTLEMAN. Now don't be troublesome: there's a good girl. [Trying
LINE 116: his pockets] I really haven't any change—Stop: here's three hapence,
LINE 117: if that's any use to you [he retreats to the other pillar].
LINE 118: THE FLOWER GIRL [disappointed, but thinking three halfpence better than
LINE 119: nothing] Thank you, sir.
LINE 120: THE BYSTANDER [to the girl] You be careful: give him a flower for it.
LINE 121: There's a bloke here behind taking down every blessed word you're
LINE 122: saying. [All turn to the man who is taking notes].
LINE 123: THE FLOWER GIRL [springing up terrified] I ain't done nothing wrong by
LINE 124: speaking to the gentleman. I've a right to sell flowers if I keep off
LINE 125: the kerb. [Hysterically] I'm a respectable girl: so help me, I never
LINE 126: spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me. [General hubbub,
LINE 127: mostly sympathetic to the flower girl, but deprecating her excessive
LINE 128: sensibility. Cries of Don't start hollerin. Who's hurting you? Nobody's
LINE 129: going to touch you. What's the good of fussing? Steady on. Easy, easy,
LINE 130: etc., come from the elderly staid spectators, who pat her comfortingly.
LINE 131: Less patient ones bid her shut her head, or ask her roughly what is
LINE 132: wrong with her. A remoter group, not knowing what the matter is, crowd
LINE 133: in and increase the noise with question and answer: What's the row?
LINE 134: What she do? Where is he? A tec taking her down. What! him? Yes: him
LINE 135: over there: Took money off the gentleman, etc. The flower girl,
LINE 136: distraught and mobbed, breaks through them to the gentleman, crying
LINE 137: mildly] Oh, sir, don't let him charge me. You dunno what it means to
LINE 138: me. They'll take away my character and drive me on the streets for
LINE 139: speaking to gentlemen. They—
LINE 140: THE NOTE TAKER [coming forward on her right, the rest crowding after
LINE 141: him] There, there, there, there! Who's hurting you, you silly girl?
LINE 142: What do you take me for?
LINE 143: THE BYSTANDER. It's all right: he's a gentleman: look at his boots.
LINE 144: [Explaining to the note taker] She thought you was a copper's nark, sir.
LINE 145: THE NOTE TAKER [with quick interest] What's a copper's nark?
LINE 146: THE BYSTANDER [inept at definition] It's a—well, it's a copper's nark,
LINE 147: as you might say. What else would you call it? A sort of informer.
LINE 148: THE FLOWER GIRL [still hysterical] I take my Bible oath I never said a
LINE 149: word—
LINE 150: THE NOTE TAKER [overbearing but good-humored] Oh, shut up, shut up. Do
LINE 151: I look like a policeman?
LINE 152: THE FLOWER GIRL [far from reassured] Then what did you take down my
LINE 153: words for? How do I know whether you took me down right? You just show
LINE 154: me what you've wrote about me. [The note taker opens his book and holds
LINE 155: it steadily under her nose, though the pressure of the mob trying to
LINE 156: read it over his shoulders would upset a weaker man]. What's that? That
LINE 157: ain't proper writing. I can't read that.
LINE 158: THE NOTE TAKER. I can. [Reads, reproducing her pronunciation exactly]
LINE 159: "Cheer ap, Keptin; n' haw ya flahr orf a pore gel."
LINE 160: THE FLOWER GIRL [much distressed] It's because I called him Captain. I
LINE 161: meant no harm. [To the gentleman] Oh, sir, don't let him lay a charge
LINE 162: agen me for a word like that. You—
LINE 163: THE GENTLEMAN. Charge! I make no charge. [To the note taker] Really,
LINE 164: sir, if you are a detective, you need not begin protecting me against
LINE 165: molestation by young women until I ask you. Anybody could see that the
LINE 166: girl meant no harm.
LINE 167: THE BYSTANDERS GENERALLY [demonstrating against police espionage]
LINE 168: Course they could. What business is it of yours? You mind your own
LINE 169: affairs. He wants promotion, he does. Taking down people's words! Girl
LINE 170: never said a word to him. What harm if she did? Nice thing a girl can't
LINE 171: shelter from the rain without being insulted, etc., etc., etc. [She is
LINE 172: conducted by the more sympathetic demonstrators back to her plinth,
LINE 173: where she resumes her seat and struggles with her emotion].
LINE 174: THE BYSTANDER. He ain't a tec. He's a blooming busybody: that's what he
LINE 175: is. I tell you, look at his boots.
LINE 176: THE NOTE TAKER [turning on him genially] And how are all your people
LINE 177: down at Selsey?
LINE 178: THE BYSTANDER [suspiciously] Who told you my people come from Selsey?
LINE 179: THE NOTE TAKER. Never you mind. They did. [To the girl] How do you come
LINE 180: to be up so far east? You were born in Lisson Grove.
LINE 181: THE FLOWER GIRL [appalled] Oh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson
LINE 182: Grove? It wasn't fit for a pig to live in; and I had to pay
LINE 183: four-and-six a week. [In tears] Oh, boo—hoo—oo—
LINE 184: THE NOTE TAKER. Live where you like; but stop that noise.
LINE 185: THE GENTLEMAN [to the girl] Come, come! he can't touch you: you have a
LINE 186: right to live where you please.
LINE 187: A SARCASTIC BYSTANDER [thrusting himself between the note taker and the
LINE 188: gentleman] Park Lane, for instance. I'd like to go into the Housing
LINE 189: Question with you, I would.
LINE 190: THE FLOWER GIRL [subsiding into a brooding melancholy over her basket,
LINE 191: and talking very low-spiritedly to herself] I'm a good girl, I am.
LINE 192: THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER [not attending to her] Do you know where _I_
LINE 193: come from?
LINE 194: THE NOTE TAKER [promptly] Hoxton.
LINE 195: Titterings. Popular interest in the note taker's performance increases.
LINE 196: THE SARCASTIC ONE [amazed] Well, who said I didn't? Bly me! You know
LINE 197: everything, you do.
LINE 198: THE FLOWER GIRL [still nursing her sense of injury] Ain't no call to
LINE 199: meddle with me, he ain't.
LINE 200: THE BYSTANDER [to her] Of course he ain't. Don't you stand it from him.
LINE 201: [To the note taker] See here: what call have you to know about people
LINE 202: what never offered to meddle with you? Where's your warrant?
LINE 203: SEVERAL BYSTANDERS [encouraged by this seeming point of law] Yes:
LINE 204: where's your warrant?
LINE 205: THE FLOWER GIRL. Let him say what he likes. I don't want to have no
LINE 206: truck with him.
LINE 207: THE BYSTANDER. You take us for dirt under your feet, don't you? Catch
LINE 208: you taking liberties with a gentleman!
LINE 209: THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. Yes: tell HIM where he come from if you want
LINE 210: to go fortune-telling.
LINE 211: THE NOTE TAKER. Cheltenham, Harrow, Cambridge, and India.
LINE 212: THE GENTLEMAN. Quite right. [Great laughter. Reaction in the note
LINE 213: taker's favor. Exclamations of He knows all about it. Told him proper.
LINE 214: Hear him tell the toff where he come from? etc.]. May I ask, sir, do
LINE 215: you do this for your living at a music hall?
LINE 216: THE NOTE TAKER. I've thought of that. Perhaps I shall some day.
LINE 217: The rain has stopped; and the persons on the outside of the crowd begin
LINE 218: to drop off.
LINE 219: THE FLOWER GIRL [resenting the reaction] He's no gentleman, he ain't,
LINE 220: to interfere with a poor girl.
LINE 221: THE DAUGHTER [out of patience, pushing her way rudely to the front and
LINE 222: displacing the gentleman, who politely retires to the other side of the
LINE 223: pillar] What on earth is Freddy doing? I shall get pneumonia if I stay
LINE 224: in this draught any longer.
LINE 225: THE NOTE TAKER [to himself, hastily making a note of her pronunciation
LINE 226: of "monia"] Earlscourt.
LINE 227: THE DAUGHTER [violently] Will you please keep your impertinent remarks
LINE 228: to yourself?
LINE 229: THE NOTE TAKER. Did I say that out loud? I didn't mean to. I beg your
LINE 230: pardon. Your mother's Epsom, unmistakeably.
LINE 231: THE MOTHER [advancing between her daughter and the note taker] How very
LINE 232: curious! I was brought up in Largelady Park, near Epsom.
LINE 233: THE NOTE TAKER [uproariously amused] Ha! ha! What a devil of a name!
LINE 234: Excuse me. [To the daughter] You want a cab, do you?
LINE 235: THE DAUGHTER. Don't dare speak to me.
LINE 236: THE MOTHER. Oh, please, please Clara. [Her daughter repudiates her with
LINE 237: an angry shrug and retires haughtily.] We should be so grateful to you,
LINE 238: sir, if you found us a cab. [The note taker produces a whistle]. Oh,
LINE 239: thank you. [She joins her daughter]. The note taker blows a piercing
LINE 240: blast.
LINE 241: THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. There! I knowed he was a plain-clothes copper.
LINE 242: THE BYSTANDER. That ain't a police whistle: that's a sporting whistle.
LINE 243: THE FLOWER GIRL [still preoccupied with her wounded feelings] He's no
LINE 244: right to take away my character. My character is the same to me as any
LINE 245: lady's.
LINE 246: THE NOTE TAKER. I don't know whether you've noticed it; but the rain
LINE 247: stopped about two minutes ago.
LINE 248: THE BYSTANDER. So it has. Why didn't you say so before? and us losing
LINE 249: our time listening to your silliness. [He walks off towards the Strand].
LINE 250: THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER. I can tell where you come from. You come from
LINE 251: Anwell. Go back there.
LINE 252: THE NOTE TAKER [helpfully] _H_anwell.
LINE 253: THE SARCASTIC BYSTANDER [affecting great distinction of speech] Thenk
LINE 254: you, teacher. Haw haw! So long [he touches his hat with mock respect
LINE 255: and strolls off].
LINE 256: THE FLOWER GIRL. Frightening people like that! How would he like it
LINE 257: himself.
LINE 258: THE MOTHER. It's quite fine now, Clara. We can walk to a motor bus.
LINE 259: Come. [She gathers her skirts above her ankles and hurries off towards
LINE 260: the Strand].
LINE 261: THE DAUGHTER. But the cab—[her mother is out of hearing]. Oh, how
LINE 262: tiresome! [She follows angrily].
LINE 263: All the rest have gone except the note taker, the gentleman, and the
LINE 264: flower girl, who sits arranging her basket, and still pitying herself
LINE 265: in murmurs.
LINE 266: THE FLOWER GIRL. Poor girl! Hard enough for her to live without being
LINE 267: worrited and chivied.
LINE 268: THE GENTLEMAN [returning to his former place on the note taker's left]
LINE 269: How do you do it, if I may ask?
LINE 270: THE NOTE TAKER. Simply phonetics. The science of speech. That's my
LINE 271: profession; also my hobby. Happy is the man who can make a living by
LINE 272: his hobby! You can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue. I
LINE 273: can place any man within six miles. I can place him within two miles in
LINE 274: London. Sometimes within two streets.
LINE 275: THE FLOWER GIRL. Ought to be ashamed of himself, unmanly coward!
LINE 276: THE GENTLEMAN. But is there a living in that?
LINE 277: THE NOTE TAKER. Oh yes. Quite a fat one. This is an age of upstarts.
LINE 278: Men begin in Kentish Town with 80 pounds a year, and end in Park Lane
LINE 279: with a hundred thousand. They want to drop Kentish Town; but they give
LINE 280: themselves away every time they open their mouths. Now I can teach
LINE 281: them—
LINE 282: THE FLOWER GIRL. Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl—
LINE 283: THE NOTE TAKER [explosively] Woman: cease this detestable boohooing
LINE 284: instantly; or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.
LINE 285: THE FLOWER GIRL [with feeble defiance] I've a right to be here if I
LINE 286: like, same as you.
LINE 287: THE NOTE TAKER. A woman who utters such depressing and disgusting
LINE 288: sounds has no right to be anywhere—no right to live. Remember that you
LINE 289: are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech:
LINE 290: that your native language is the language of Shakespear and Milton and
LINE 291: The Bible; and don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.
LINE 292: THE FLOWER GIRL [quite overwhelmed, and looking up at him in mingled
LINE 293: wonder and deprecation without daring to raise her head]
LINE 294: Ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—oo!
LINE 295: THE NOTE TAKER [whipping out his book] Heavens! what a sound! [He
LINE 296: writes; then holds out the book and reads, reproducing her vowels
LINE 297: exactly] Ah—ah—ah—ow—ow—ow—oo!
LINE 298: THE FLOWER GIRL [tickled by the performance, and laughing in spite of
LINE 299: herself] Garn!
LINE 300: THE NOTE TAKER. You see this creature with her kerbstone English: the
LINE 301: English that will keep her in the gutter to the end of her days. Well,
LINE 302: sir, in three months I could pass that girl off as a duchess at an
LINE 303: ambassador's garden party. I could even get her a place as lady's maid
LINE 304: or shop assistant, which requires better English. That's the sort of
LINE 305: thing I do for commercial millionaires. And on the profits of it I do
LINE 306: genuine scientific work in phonetics, and a little as a poet on
LINE 307: Miltonic lines.
LINE 308: THE GENTLEMAN. I am myself a student of Indian dialects; and—
LINE 309: THE NOTE TAKER [eagerly] Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the
LINE 310: author of Spoken Sanscrit?
LINE 311: THE GENTLEMAN. I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?
LINE 312: THE NOTE TAKER. Henry Higgins, author of Higgins's Universal Alphabet.
LINE 313: PICKERING [with enthusiasm] I came from India to meet you.
LINE 314: HIGGINS. I was going to India to meet you.
LINE 315: PICKERING. Where do you live?
LINE 316: HIGGINS. 27A Wimpole Street. Come and see me tomorrow.
LINE 317: PICKERING. I'm at the Carlton. Come with me now and let's have a jaw
LINE 318: over some supper.
LINE 319: HIGGINS. Right you are.
LINE 320: THE FLOWER GIRL [to Pickering, as he passes her] Buy a flower, kind
LINE 321: gentleman. I'm short for my lodging.
LINE 322: PICKERING. I really haven't any change. I'm sorry [he goes away].
LINE 323: HIGGINS [shocked at girl's mendacity] Liar. You said you could change
LINE 324: half-a-crown.
LINE 325: THE FLOWER GIRL [rising in desperation] You ought to be stuffed with
LINE 326: nails, you ought. [Flinging the basket at his feet] Take the whole
LINE 327: blooming basket for sixpence.
LINE 328: The church clock strikes the second quarter.
LINE 329: HIGGINS [hearing in it the voice of God, rebuking him for his Pharisaic
LINE 330: want of charity to the poor girl] A reminder. [He raises his hat
LINE 331: solemnly; then throws a handful of money into the basket and follows
LINE 332: Pickering].
LINE 333: THE FLOWER GIRL [picking up a half-crown] Ah—ow—ooh! [Picking up a
LINE 334: couple of florins] Aaah—ow—ooh! [Picking up several coins]
LINE 335: Aaaaaah—ow—ooh! [Picking up a half-sovereign]
LINE 336: Aasaaaaaaaaah—ow—ooh!!!
LINE 337: FREDDY [springing out of a taxicab] Got one at last. Hallo! [To the
LINE 338: girl] Where are the two ladies that were here?
LINE 339: THE FLOWER GIRL. They walked to the bus when the rain stopped.
LINE 340: FREDDY. And left me with a cab on my hands. Damnation!
LINE 341: THE FLOWER GIRL [with grandeur] Never you mind, young man. I'm going
LINE 342: home in a taxi. [She sails off to the cab. The driver puts his hand
LINE 343: behind him and holds the door firmly shut against her. Quite
LINE 344: understanding his mistrust, she shows him her handful of money].
LINE 345: Eightpence ain't no object to me, Charlie. [He grins and opens the
LINE 346: door]. Angel Court, Drury Lane, round the corner of Micklejohn's oil
LINE 347: shop. Let's see how fast you can make her hop it. [She gets in and
LINE 348: pulls the door to with a slam as the taxicab starts].
LINE 349: FREDDY. Well, I'm dashed!
