LINE 1: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground:
LINE 2: (1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4)
LINE 3: open ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground;
LINE 4: (7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.
LINE 5: 2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive
LINE 6: ground.
LINE 7: [So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and anxious
LINE 8: to see their wives and children, are likely to seize the opportunity
LINE 9: afforded by a battle and scatter in every direction. "In their
LINE 10: advance," observes Tu Mu, "they will lack the valor of desperation, and
LINE 11: when they retreat, they will find harbors of refuge."]
LINE 12: 3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great
LINE 13: distance, it is facile ground.
LINE 14: [Li Ch'uan and Ho Shih say "because of the facility for retreating,"
LINE 15: and the other commentators give similar explanations. Tu Mu remarks:
LINE 16: "When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and
LINE 17: bridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no
LINE 18: hankering after home."]
LINE 19: 4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either
LINE 20: side, is contentious ground.
LINE 21: [Tu Mu defines the ground as ground "to be contended for." Ts'ao Kung
LINE 22: says: "ground on which the few and the weak can defeat the many and the
LINE 23: strong," such as "the neck of a pass," instanced by Li Ch'uan. Thus,
LINE 24: Thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it,
LINE 25: even for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in
LINE 26: check and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.:
LINE 27: "For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is
LINE 28: nothing better than a narrow pass." When Lu Kuang was returning from
LINE 29: his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far
LINE 30: as I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou,
LINE 31: taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch'in, plotted
LINE 32: against him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han,
LINE 33: governor of Kao-ch'ang, counseled him, saying: "Lu Kuang is fresh from
LINE 34: his victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and
LINE 35: mettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we
LINE 36: shall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan.
LINE 37: Let us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass,
LINE 38: thus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are
LINE 39: prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or
LINE 40: if you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a
LINE 41: stand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and
LINE 42: resource of Tzŭ-fang himself would be expended in vain against the
LINE 43: enormous strength of these two positions." Liang Hsi, refusing to act
LINE 44: on this advice, was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader.]
LINE 45: 5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.
LINE 46: [There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this
LINE 47: type of ground. Ts'ao Kung says it means "ground covered with a network
LINE 48: of roads," like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: "ground on which
LINE 49: intercommunication is easy."]
LINE 50: 6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,
LINE 51: [Ts'au Kung defines this as: "Our country adjoining the enemy's and a
LINE 52: third country conterminous with both." Meng Shih instances the small
LINE 53: principality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch'i, on
LINE 54: the west by Chin, and on the south by Ch'u.]
LINE 55: so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,
LINE 56: [The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most
LINE 57: of them to become his allies.]
LINE 58: is ground of intersecting highways.
LINE 59: 7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country,
LINE 60: leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.
LINE 61: [Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that "when an army has reached
LINE 62: such a point, its situation is serious."]
LINE 63: 8. Mountain forests,
LINE 64: [Or simply "forests."]
LINE 65: rugged steeps, marshes and fens—all country that is hard to traverse:
LINE 66: this is difficult ground.
LINE 67: 9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can
LINE 68: only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy
LINE 69: would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in
LINE 70: ground.
LINE 71: 10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting
LINE 72: without delay, is desperate ground.
LINE 73: [The situation, as pictured by Ts'ao Kung, is very similar to the
LINE 74: "hemmed-in ground" except that here escape is no longer possible: "A
LINE 75: lofty mountain in front, a large river behind, advance impossible,
LINE 76: retreat blocked." Ch'en Hao says: "to be on 'desperate ground' is like
LINE 77: sitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house." Tu Mu
LINE 78: quotes from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus
LINE 79: entrapped: "Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid
LINE 80: of local guides:—it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy's
LINE 81: mercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a pathway so
LINE 82: perilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots
LINE 83: carried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut off behind, no
LINE 84: choice but to proceed in single file. Then, before there is time to
LINE 85: range our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy is overwhelming
LINE 86: strength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take
LINE 87: a breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a
LINE 88: pitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us
LINE 89: has a moment's respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days
LINE 90: and months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain
LINE 91: the enemy's attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute
LINE 92: of water and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life,
LINE 93: the horses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of
LINE 94: strength and skill unavailing, the pass so narrow that a single man
LINE 95: defending it can check the onset of ten thousand; all means of offense
LINE 96: in the hands of the enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by
LINE 97: ourselves:—in this terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant
LINE 98: soldiers and the keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with
LINE 99: the slightest effect?" Students of Greek history may be reminded of the
LINE 100: awful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians
LINE 101: under Nicias and Demonsthenes. [See Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.].]
LINE 102: 11. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt
LINE 103: not. On contentious ground, attack not.
LINE 104: [But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous
LINE 105: position first. So Ts'ao Kung. Li Ch'uan and others, however, suppose
LINE 106: the meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that
LINE 107: it would be sheer madness to attack. In the _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_, when the
LINE 108: King of Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tzŭ replies:
LINE 109: "The rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession
LINE 110: have the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is
LINE 111: secured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by
LINE 112: pretending to flee—show your banners and sound your drums—make a dash
LINE 113: for other places that he cannot afford to lose—trail brushwood and
LINE 114: raise a dust—confound his ears and eyes—detach a body of your best
LINE 115: troops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will
LINE 116: sally forth to the rescue."]
LINE 117: 12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way.
LINE 118: [Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking
LINE 119: force itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available
LINE 120: here. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts'ao Kung's
LINE 121: brief note: "Draw closer together"—i.e., see that a portion of your own
LINE 122: army is not cut off.]
LINE 123: On ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.
LINE 124: [Or perhaps, "form alliances with neighbouring states."]
LINE 125: 13. On serious ground, gather in plunder.
LINE 126: [On this, Li Ch'uan has the following delicious note: "When an army
LINE 127: penetrates far into the enemy's country, care must be taken not to
LINE 128: alienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han
LINE 129: Emperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch'in territory was marked by no
LINE 130: violation of women or looting of valuables. [Nota bene: this was in 207
LINE 131: B.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that
LINE 132: entered Peking in 1900 A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the
LINE 133: present passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not
LINE 134: 'plunder,' but 'do not plunder.'" Alas, I fear that in this instance
LINE 135: the worthy commentator's feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least,
LINE 136: has no such illusions. He says: "When encamped on 'serious ground,'
LINE 137: there being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility
LINE 138: of retreat, one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by
LINE 139: bringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the
LINE 140: enemy."]
LINE 141: In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.
LINE 142: [Or, in the words of VIII. § 2, "do not encamp.]
LINE 143: 14. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.
LINE 144: [Ts'au Kung says: "Try the effect of some unusual artifice;" and Tu Yu
LINE 145: amplifies this by saying: "In such a position, some scheme must be
LINE 146: devised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in
LINE 147: deluding the enemy, the peril may be escaped." This is exactly what
LINE 148: happened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the
LINE 149: mountains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by
LINE 150: the dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his
LINE 151: foes was remarkably like that which T'ien Tan had also employed with
LINE 152: success exactly 62 years before. [See IX. § 24, note.] When night came
LINE 153: on, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and
LINE 154: set on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the
LINE 155: mountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The
LINE 156: strange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and
LINE 157: discomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and
LINE 158: Hannibal's army passed safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III.
LINE 159: 93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.]
LINE 160: On desperate ground, fight.
LINE 161: [For, as Chia Lin remarks: "if you fight with all your might, there is
LINE 162: a chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your
LINE 163: corner."]
LINE 164: 15. Those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a
LINE 165: wedge between the enemy's front and rear;
LINE 166: [More literally, "cause the front and rear to lose touch with each
LINE 167: other."]
LINE 168: to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to
LINE 169: hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from
LINE 170: rallying their men.
LINE 171: 16. When the enemy's men were scattered, they prevented them from
LINE 172: concentrating; even when their forces were united, they managed to keep
LINE 173: them in disorder.
LINE 174: 17. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when
LINE 175: otherwise, they stopped still.
LINE 176: [Mei Yao-ch'en connects this with the foregoing: "Having succeeded in
LINE 177: thus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward in order to secure
LINE 178: any advantage to be gained; if there was no advantage to be gained,
LINE 179: they would remain where they were."]
LINE 180: 18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly
LINE 181: array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: "Begin
LINE 182: by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be
LINE 183: amenable to your will."
LINE 184: [Opinions differ as to what Sun Tzŭ had in mind. Ts'ao Kung thinks it
LINE 185: is "some strategical advantage on which the enemy is depending." Tu Mu
LINE 186: says: "The three things which an enemy is anxious to do, and on the
LINE 187: accomplishment of which his success depends, are: (1) to capture our
LINE 188: favourable positions; (2) to ravage our cultivated land; (3) to guard
LINE 189: his own communications." Our object then must be to thwart his plans in
LINE 190: these three directions and thus render him helpless. [Cf. III. § 3.] By
LINE 191: boldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw the other
LINE 192: side on the defensive.]
LINE 193: 19. Rapidity is the essence of war:
LINE 194: [According to Tu Mu, "this is a summary of leading principles in
LINE 195: warfare," and he adds: "These are the profoundest truths of military
LINE 196: science, and the chief business of the general." The following
LINE 197: anecdotes, told by Ho Shih, shows the importance attached to speed by
LINE 198: two of China's greatest generals. In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of
LINE 199: Hsin-ch'eng under the Wei Emperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to
LINE 200: the House of Shu, and had entered into correspondence with Chu-ko
LINE 201: Liang, Prime Minister of that State. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then
LINE 202: military governor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta's treachery, he
LINE 203: at once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having
LINE 204: previously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import.
LINE 205: Ssu-ma's officers came to him and said: "If Meng Ta has leagued himself
LINE 206: with Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we
LINE 207: make a move." Ssu-ma I replied: "Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we
LINE 208: ought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and
LINE 209: before he has thrown off the mask." Then, by a series of forced
LINE 210: marches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch'eng with in a
LINE 211: space of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to
LINE 212: Chu-ko Liang: "Wan is 1200 _li_ from here. When the news of my revolt
LINE 213: reaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it
LINE 214: will be a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time
LINE 215: my city will be well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come
LINE 216: himself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth
LINE 217: troubling about." The next letter, however, was filled with
LINE 218: consternation: "Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my
LINE 219: allegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous
LINE 220: rapidity is this!" A fortnight later, Hsin- ch'eng had fallen and Meng
LINE 221: Ta had lost his head. [See _Chin Shu_, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li
LINE 222: Ching was sent from K'uei-chou in Ssu-ch'uan to reduce the successful
LINE 223: rebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou
LINE 224: Fu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood, Hsiao
LINE 225: Hsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come down
LINE 226: through the gorges, and consequently made no preparations. But Li Ching
LINE 227: embarked his army without loss of time, and was just about to start
LINE 228: when the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until
LINE 229: the river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching
LINE 230: replied: "To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount
LINE 231: importance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to
LINE 232: strike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army
LINE 233: together. If we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we
LINE 234: shall appear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the
LINE 235: thunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against
LINE 236: it. [See VII. § 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if
LINE 237: he gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in
LINE 238: such a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full
LINE 239: fruits of victory will be ours." All came about as he predicted, and
LINE 240: Hsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people
LINE 241: should be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of death.]
LINE 242: take advantage of the enemy's unreadiness, make your way by unexpected
LINE 243: routes, and attack unguarded spots.
LINE 244: 20. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading
LINE 245: force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be
LINE 246: the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail
LINE 247: against you.
LINE 248: 21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with
LINE 249: food.
LINE 250: [Cf. _supra_, § 13. Li Ch'uan does not venture on a note here.]
LINE 251: 22. Carefully study the well-being of your men,
LINE 252: [For "well-being", Wang Hsi means, "Pet them, humor them, give them
LINE 253: plenty of food and drink, and look after them generally."]
LINE 254: and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your
LINE 255: strength.
LINE 256: [Ch'en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous
LINE 257: general Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the
LINE 258: success of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch'u State, where a
LINE 259: universal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the
LINE 260: temper of his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained
LINE 261: strictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch'u general try to force a
LINE 262: battle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not
LINE 263: come out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the
LINE 264: affection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be
LINE 265: well fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for
LINE 266: bathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them
LINE 267: into a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told
LINE 268: off certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves.
LINE 269: The answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting
LINE 270: the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were
LINE 271: engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been
LINE 272: strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for
LINE 273: fighting. By this time the Ch'u army, after repeating their challenge
LINE 274: again and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch'in
LINE 275: general immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the
LINE 276: battle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly
LINE 277: afterwards, the whole of Ch'u was conquered by Ch'in, and the king
LINE 278: Fu-ch'u led into captivity.]
LINE 279: Keep your army continually on the move,
LINE 280: [In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has
LINE 281: struck me, however, that the true reading might be "link your army
LINE 282: together."]
LINE 283: and devise unfathomable plans.
LINE 284: 23. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and
LINE 285: they will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is
LINE 286: nothing they may not achieve.
LINE 287: [Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 3): "If one man were to
LINE 288: run amok with a sword in the market-place, and everybody else tried to
LINE 289: get our of his way, I should not allow that this man alone had courage
LINE 290: and that all the rest were contemptible cowards. The truth is, that a
LINE 291: desperado and a man who sets some value on his life do not meet on even
LINE 292: terms."]
LINE 293: Officers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.
LINE 294: [Chang Yu says: "If they are in an awkward place together, they will
LINE 295: surely exert their united strength to get out of it."]
LINE 296: 24. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there
LINE 297: is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart
LINE 298: of a hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no
LINE 299: help for it, they will fight hard.
LINE 300: 25. Thus, without waiting to be marshalled, the soldiers will be
LINE 301: constantly on the _qui vive;_ without waiting to be asked, they will do
LINE 302: your will;
LINE 303: [Literally, "without asking, you will get."]
LINE 304: without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders,
LINE 305: they can be trusted.
LINE 306: 26. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious
LINE 307: doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.
LINE 308: [The superstitious, "bound in to saucy doubts and fears," degenerate
LINE 309: into cowards and "die many times before their deaths." Tu Mu quotes
LINE 310: Huang Shih-kung: "'Spells and incantations should be strictly
LINE 311: forbidden, and no officer allowed to inquire by divination into the
LINE 312: fortunes of an army, for fear the soldiers' minds should be seriously
LINE 313: perturbed.' The meaning is," he continues, "that if all doubts and
LINE 314: scruples are discarded, your men will never falter in their resolution
LINE 315: until they die."]
LINE 316: 27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because
LINE 317: they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it
LINE 318: is not because they are disinclined to longevity.
LINE 319: [Chang Yu has the best note on this passage: "Wealth and long life are
LINE 320: things for which all men have a natural inclination. Hence, if they
LINE 321: burn or fling away valuables, and sacrifice their own lives, it is not
LINE 322: that they dislike them, but simply that they have no choice." Sun Tzŭ
LINE 323: is slyly insinuating that, as soldiers are but human, it is for the
LINE 324: general to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not
LINE 325: thrown in their way.]
LINE 326: 28. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,
LINE 327: [The word in the Chinese is "snivel." This is taken to indicate more
LINE 328: genuine grief than tears alone.]
LINE 329: those sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting
LINE 330: the tears run down their cheeks.
LINE 331: [Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts'ao Kung says, "all
LINE 332: have embraced the firm resolution to do or die." We may remember that
LINE 333: the heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike in showing their
LINE 334: emotion. Chang Yu alludes to the mournful parting at the I River
LINE 335: between Ching K'o and his friends, when the former was sent to attempt
LINE 336: the life of the King of Ch'in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C.
LINE 337: The tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and
LINE 338: uttered the following lines: "The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the
LINE 339: burn; Your champion is going—Not to return." [1] ]
LINE 340: But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage
LINE 341: of a Chu or a Kuei.
LINE 342: [Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and
LINE 343: contemporary with Sun Tzŭ himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang,
LINE 344: better known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with
LINE 345: a dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a
LINE 346: banquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to
LINE 347: pieces by the king's bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero
LINE 348: referred to, Ts'ao Kuei (or Ts'ao Mo), performed the exploit which has
LINE 349: made his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice
LINE 350: defeated by Ch'i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering
LINE 351: a large slice of territory, when Ts'ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung,
LINE 352: the Duke of Ch'i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger
LINE 353: against his chest. None of the duke's retainers dared to move a muscle,
LINE 354: and Ts'ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu
LINE 355: was being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker
LINE 356: state. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent,
LINE 357: whereupon Ts'ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his
LINE 358: place amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed
LINE 359: color. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate
LINE 360: the bargain, but his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him
LINE 361: the impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold
LINE 362: stroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched
LINE 363: battles.]
LINE 364: 29. The skilful tactician may be likened to the _shuai-jan_. Now the
LINE 365: _shuai-jan_ is a snake that is found in the Ch'ang mountains.
LINE 366: ["_Shuai-jan_" means "suddenly" or "rapidly," and the snake in question
LINE 367: was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through
LINE 368: this passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the
LINE 369: sense of "military manœuvers."]
LINE 370: Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its
LINE 371: tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and
LINE 372: you will be attacked by head and tail both.
LINE 373: 30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_,
LINE 374: [That is, as Mei Yao-ch'en says, "Is it possible to make the front and
LINE 375: rear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as
LINE 376: though they were part of a single living body?"]
LINE 377: I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are
LINE 378: enemies;
LINE 379: [Cf. VI. § 21.]
LINE 380: yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a
LINE 381: storm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand
LINE 382: helps the right.
LINE 383: [The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of
LINE 384: common peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound
LINE 385: together as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet
LINE 386: it is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of
LINE 387: cooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.]
LINE 388: 31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of
LINE 389: horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.
LINE 390: [These quaint devices to prevent one's army from running away recall
LINE 391: the Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the
LINE 392: battle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one
LINE 393: spot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tzŭ, to
LINE 394: render flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed
LINE 395: unless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a
LINE 396: spirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be
LINE 397: learned from the _shuai-jan_.]
LINE 398: 32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard
LINE 399: of courage which all must reach.
LINE 400: [Literally, "level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of]
LINE 401: one." If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it
LINE 402: follows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be
LINE 403: of the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain
LINE 404: standard. Wellington's seemingly ungrateful description of his army at
LINE 405: Waterloo as "the worst he had ever commanded" meant no more than that
LINE 406: it was deficient in this important particular—unity of spirit and
LINE 407: courage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept
LINE 408: those troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the
LINE 409: day.]
LINE 410: 33. How to make the best of both strong and weak—that is a question
LINE 411: involving the proper use of ground.
LINE 412: [Mei Yao-ch'en's paraphrase is: "The way to eliminate the differences
LINE 413: of strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize
LINE 414: accidental features of the ground." Less reliable troops, if posted in
LINE 415: strong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more
LINE 416: exposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority
LINE 417: in stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: "With all respect to the
LINE 418: text books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to
LINE 419: think that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no
LINE 420: means sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions…
LINE 421: and to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are
LINE 422: defending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural
LINE 423: features." [2] ]
LINE 424: 34. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were
LINE 425: leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.
LINE 426: [Tu Mu says: "The simile has reference to the ease with which he does
LINE 427: it."]
LINE 428: 35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure
LINE 429: secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.
LINE 430: 36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports
LINE 431: and appearances,
LINE 432: [Literally, "to deceive their eyes and ears."]
LINE 433: and thus keep them in total ignorance.
LINE 434: [Ts'ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: "The troops must
LINE 435: not be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only
LINE 436: rejoice with you over their happy outcome." "To mystify, mislead, and
LINE 437: surprise the enemy," is one of the first principles in war, as had been
LINE 438: frequently pointed out. But how about the other process—the
LINE 439: mystification of one's own men? Those who may think that Sun Tzŭ is
LINE 440: over-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson's
LINE 441: remarks on Stonewall Jackson's Valley campaign: "The infinite pains,"
LINE 442: he says, "with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most
LINE 443: trusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his
LINE 444: thoughts, a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless"—etc.
LINE 445: etc. [3] In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the _Hou Han
LINE 446: Shu_, "Pan Ch'ao took the field with 25,000 men from Khotan and other
LINE 447: Central Asian states with the object of crushing Yarkand. The King of
LINE 448: Kutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place
LINE 449: with an army drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t'ou,
LINE 450: totaling 50,000 men. Pan Ch'ao summoned his officers and also the King
LINE 451: of Khotan to a council of war, and said: 'Our forces are now
LINE 452: outnumbered and unable to make head against the enemy. The best plan,
LINE 453: then, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different
LINE 454: direction. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route,
LINE 455: and I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the
LINE 456: evening drum has sounded and then start.' Pan Ch'ao now secretly
LINE 457: released the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha
LINE 458: was thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set
LINE 459: off at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch'ao's retreat
LINE 460: in the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in
LINE 461: order to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as Pan Ch'ao knew that
LINE 462: the two chieftains had gone, he called his divisions together, got them
LINE 463: well in hand, and at cock-crow hurled them against the army of Yarkand,
LINE 464: as it lay encamped. The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion,
LINE 465: and were closely pursued by Pan Ch'ao. Over 5000 heads were brought
LINE 466: back as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and
LINE 467: cattle and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating,
LINE 468: Kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces. From
LINE 469: that time forward, Pan Ch'ao's prestige completely overawed the
LINE 470: countries of the west." In this case, we see that the Chinese general
LINE 471: not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but
LINE 472: actually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive
LINE 473: the enemy.]
LINE 474: 37. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,
LINE 475: [Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice.]
LINE 476: he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.
LINE 477: [Chang Yu, in a quotation from another work, says: "The axiom, that war
LINE 478: is based on deception, does not apply only to deception of the enemy.
LINE 479: You must deceive even your own soldiers. Make them follow you, but
LINE 480: without letting them know why."]
LINE 481: By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the
LINE 482: enemy from anticipating his purpose.
LINE 483: 38. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has
LINE 484: climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He
LINE 485: carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.
LINE 486: [Literally, "releases the spring" (see V. § 15), that is, takes some
LINE 487: decisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return—like
LINE 488: Hsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a river. Ch'en Hao,
LINE 489: followed by Chia Lin, understands the words less well as "puts forth
LINE 490: every artifice at his command."]
LINE 491: 39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd
LINE 492: driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and
LINE 493: none knows whither he is going.
LINE 494: [Tu Mu says: "The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or
LINE 495: retreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and
LINE 496: conquering."]
LINE 497: 40. To muster his host and bring it into danger:—this may be termed the
LINE 498: business of the general.
LINE 499: [Sun Tzŭ means that after mobilization there should be no delay in
LINE 500: aiming a blow at the enemy's heart. Note how he returns again and again
LINE 501: to this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was
LINE 502: no doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the
LINE 503: armies of today.]
LINE 504: 41. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground;
LINE 505: [Chang Yu says: "One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules
LINE 506: for the nine varieties of ground."]
LINE 507: the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental
LINE 508: laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be
LINE 509: studied.
LINE 510: 42. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that
LINE 511: penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means
LINE 512: dispersion.
LINE 513: [Cf. _supra_, § 20.]
LINE 514: 43. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across
LINE 515: neighbourhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.
LINE 516: [This "ground" is curiously mentioned in VIII. § 2, but it does not
LINE 517: figure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X.
LINE 518: One's first impulse would be to translate it distant ground," but this,
LINE 519: if we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here.
LINE 520: Mei Yao-ch'en says it is "a position not far enough advanced to be
LINE 521: called 'facile,' and not near enough to home to be 'dispersive,' but
LINE 522: something between the two." Wang Hsi says: "It is ground separated from
LINE 523: home by an interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in
LINE 524: order to reach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business
LINE 525: there quickly." He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which
LINE 526: is the reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.]
LINE 527: When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is
LINE 528: one of intersecting highways.
LINE 529: 44. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.
LINE 530: When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.
LINE 531: 45. When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow
LINE 532: passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of
LINE 533: refuge at all, it is desperate ground.
LINE 534: 46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity
LINE 535: of purpose.
LINE 536: [This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the
LINE 537: defensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. _supra_, § 11.]
LINE 538: On facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between
LINE 539: all parts of my army.
LINE 540: [As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible
LINE 541: contingencies: "(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden
LINE 542: attack on the part of the enemy." Cf. VII. § 17. Mei Yao-ch'en says:
LINE 543: "On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an
LINE 544: encampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications."]
LINE 545: 47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.
LINE 546: [This is Ts'ao Kung's interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: "We
LINE 547: must quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach
LINE 548: the goal." That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way
LINE 549: apart. Mei Yao-ch'en offers another equally plausible explanation:
LINE 550: "Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we
LINE 551: are behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute
LINE 552: its possession." Ch'en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy
LINE 553: has had time to select his own ground, quotes VI. § 1, where Sun Tzŭ
LINE 554: warns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the
LINE 555: situation is rather vaguely expressed: "If there is a favourable
LINE 556: position lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to
LINE 557: occupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make
LINE 558: a fight for it, you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body,
LINE 559: and victory will be assured." It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat
LINE 560: the army of Ch'in. (See p. 57.)]
LINE 561: 48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On
LINE 562: ground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.
LINE 563: 49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of
LINE 564: supplies.
LINE 565: [The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as
LINE 566: one might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.]
LINE 567: On difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.
LINE 568: 50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.
LINE 569: [Meng Shih says: "To make it seem that I meant to defend the position,
LINE 570: whereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy's
LINE 571: lines." Mei Yao-ch'en says: "in order to make my soldiers fight with
LINE 572: desperation." Wang Hsi says, "fearing lest my men be tempted to run
LINE 573: away." Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. § 36, where
LINE 574: it is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards
LINE 575: Emperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under
LINE 576: Erh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small,
LINE 577: consisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The
LINE 578: lines of investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps
LINE 579: being left at certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to
LINE 580: escape, actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets
LINE 581: himself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped
LINE 582: together. As soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing
LINE 583: for it but to conquer or die, their spirits rose to an extraordinary
LINE 584: pitch of exaltation, and they charged with such desperate ferocity that
LINE 585: the opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught.]
LINE 586: On desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness
LINE 587: of saving their lives.
LINE 588: Tu Yu says: "Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores
LINE 589: and provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and
LINE 590: make it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to
LINE 591: the death." Mei Yao-ch'en says: "The only chance of life lies in giving
LINE 592: up all hope of it." This concludes what Sun Tzŭ has to say about
LINE 593: "grounds" and the "variations" corresponding to them. Reviewing the
LINE 594: passages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be
LINE 595: struck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is
LINE 596: treated. Sun Tzŭ begins abruptly in VIII. § 2 to enumerate "variations"
LINE 597: before touching on "grounds" at all, but only mentions five, namely
LINE 598: nos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included
LINE 599: in it. A few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion
LINE 600: of chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six
LINE 601: variations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though
LINE 602: the first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next
LINE 603: chapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par
LINE 604: excellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down
LINE 605: to § 14. In §§ 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2,
LINE 606: 8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed
LINE 607: in chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once
LINE 608: more from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7,
LINE 609: being different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to
LINE 610: account for the present state of Sun Tzŭ's text, a few suggestive facts
LINE 611: maybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title,
LINE 612: should deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is
LINE 613: an abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds.
LINE 614: Several of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two
LINE 615: distinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the
LINE 616: chapter is disproportionate, being double that of any other except IX.
LINE 617: I do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the
LINE 618: general conclusion that Sun Tzŭ's work cannot have come down to us in
LINE 619: the shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective
LINE 620: and probably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has
LINE 621: either been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.]
LINE 622: 51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate
LINE 623: resistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,
LINE 624: and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.
LINE 625: [Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch'ao's devoted followers in 73
LINE 626: A.D. The story runs thus in the _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47: "When Pan Ch'ao
LINE 627: arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at
LINE 628: first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his
LINE 629: behavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.
LINE 630: Pan Ch'ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: 'Have you
LINE 631: noticed,' he said, 'that Kuang's polite intentions are on the wane?
LINE 632: This must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians,
LINE 633: and that consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with
LINE 634: which side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly
LINE 635: wise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to
LINE 636: pass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!' Thereupon
LINE 637: he called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and
LINE 638: set a trap for him, saying: 'Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu
LINE 639: who arrived some day ago?' The man was so taken aback that between
LINE 640: surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch'ao,
LINE 641: keeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a
LINE 642: general gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began
LINE 643: drinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a
LINE 644: little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them
LINE 645: thus: 'Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region,
LINE 646: anxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it
LINE 647: happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom
LINE 648: only a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy
LINE 649: extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this
LINE 650: envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the
LINE 651: Hsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert.
LINE 652: What are we to do?' With one accord, the officers replied: 'Standing as
LINE 653: we do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life
LINE 654: and death.' For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. § 1,
LINE 655: note.]
LINE 656: 52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are
LINE 657: acquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the
LINE 658: march unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains
LINE 659: and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We
LINE 660: shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make
LINE 661: use of local guides.
LINE 662: [These three sentences are repeated from VII. §§ 12-14—in order to
LINE 663: emphasize their importance, the commentators seem to think. I prefer to
LINE 664: regard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the
LINE 665: following words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tzŭ might have added
LINE 666: that there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their
LINE 667: treachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):
LINE 668: Hannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the
LINE 669: neighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be
LINE 670: occupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of
LINE 671: Latin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of
LINE 672: Casinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that
LINE 673: direction, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost
LINE 674: arrived.]
LINE 675: 53. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles
LINE 676: does not befit a warlike prince.
LINE 677: 54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship
LINE 678: shows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He
LINE 679: overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining
LINE 680: against him.
LINE 681: [Mei Tao-ch'en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so
LINE 682: much affected by the Chinese: "In attacking a powerful state, if you
LINE 683: can divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you
LINE 684: have a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you
LINE 685: overawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if
LINE 686: the neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy's allies will be
LINE 687: prevented from joining her." The following gives a stronger meaning:
LINE 688: "If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to
LINE 689: summon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain
LINE 690: from massing their forces." Ch'en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in
LINE 691: quite another way. The former says: "Powerful though a prince may be,
LINE 692: if he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops,
LINE 693: and must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with
LINE 694: this, and with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries
LINE 695: to intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated." Chang Yu puts his
LINE 696: view thus: "If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will
LINE 697: be discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our
LINE 698: display of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the
LINE 699: other chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us."]
LINE 700: 55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor
LINE 701: does he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret
LINE 702: designs, keeping his antagonists in awe.
LINE 703: [The train of thought, as said by Li Ch'uan, appears to be this: Secure
LINE 704: against a combination of his enemies, "he can afford to reject
LINE 705: entangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his
LINE 706: prestige enable him to dispense with external friendships."]
LINE 707: Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.
LINE 708: [This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch'in State
LINE 709: became a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which
LINE 710: the famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final
LINE 711: triumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note,
LINE 712: thinks that Sun Tzŭ is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded
LINE 713: selfishness and haughty isolation.]
LINE 714: 56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule,
LINE 715: [Wu Tzŭ (ch. 3) less wisely says: "Let advance be richly rewarded and
LINE 716: retreat be heavily punished."]
LINE 717: issue orders
LINE 718: [Literally, "hang" or post up."]
LINE 719: without regard to previous arrangements;
LINE 720: ["In order to prevent treachery," says Wang Hsi. The general meaning is
LINE 721: made clear by Ts'ao Kung's quotation from the _Ssu-ma Fa:_ "Give
LINE 722: instructions only on sighting the enemy; give rewards when you see
LINE 723: deserving deeds." Ts'ao Kung's paraphrase: "The final instructions you
LINE 724: give to your army should not correspond with those that have been
LINE 725: previously posted up." Chang Yu simplifies this into "your arrangements
LINE 726: should not be divulged beforehand." And Chia Lin says: "there should be
LINE 727: no fixity in your rules and arrangements." Not only is there danger in
LINE 728: letting your plans be known, but war often necessitates the entire
LINE 729: reversal of them at the last moment.]
LINE 730: and you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do
LINE 731: with but a single man.
LINE 732: [Cf. _supra_, § 34.]
LINE 733: 57. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know
LINE 734: your design.
LINE 735: [Literally, "do not tell them words;" i.e. do not give your reasons for
LINE 736: any order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to "give no
LINE 737: reasons" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a
LINE 738: general than to a judge.]
LINE 739: When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them
LINE 740: nothing when the situation is gloomy.
LINE 741: 58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it
LINE 742: into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.
LINE 743: [These words of Sun Tzŭ were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of
LINE 744: the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already
LINE 745: alluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,
LINE 746: and halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the
LINE 747: enemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body
LINE 748: of 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red
LINE 749: flag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles
LINE 750: and keep a secret watch on the enemy. "When the men of Chao see me in
LINE 751: full flight," Han Hsin said, "they will abandon their fortifications
LINE 752: and give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down
LINE 753: the Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead."
LINE 754: Turning then to his other officers, he remarked: "Our adversary holds a
LINE 755: strong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he
LINE 756: sees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I
LINE 757: should turn back and escape through the mountains." So saying, he first
LINE 758: of all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them
LINE 759: to form in line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this
LINE 760: manœuver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time
LINE 761: it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo's
LINE 762: flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately
LINE 763: engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time;
LINE 764: until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and
LINE 765: banner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where
LINE 766: another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them
LINE 767: and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but
LINE 768: the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was
LINE 769: fighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the
LINE 770: 2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao
LINE 771: following up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls,
LINE 772: tore up the enemy's flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the
LINE 773: Chao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags
LINE 774: struck them with terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and
LINE 775: overpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of
LINE 776: their leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on
LINE 777: them from both sides and completed the rout, killing a number and
LINE 778: capturing the rest, amongst whom was King Ya himself…. After the
LINE 779: battle, some of Han Hsin's officers came to him and said: "In the _Art
LINE 780: of War_ we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a
LINE 781: river or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun
LINE 782: Tzŭ and T'ai Kung. See IX § 9, and note.] You, on the contrary, ordered
LINE 783: us to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under these
LINE 784: conditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?" The general
LINE 785: replied: "I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of War with
LINE 786: sufficient care. Is it not written there: 'Plunge your army into
LINE 787: desperate straits and it will come off in safety; place it in deadly
LINE 788: peril and it will survive'? Had I taken the usual course, I should
LINE 789: never have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the
LINE 790: Military Classic—'Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off
LINE 791: to fight.' [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun
LINE 792: Tzŭ.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were
LINE 793: obliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow
LINE 794: his own discretion, there would have been a general _débandade_, and it
LINE 795: would have been impossible to do anything with them." The officers
LINE 796: admitted the force of his argument, and said: "These are higher tactics
LINE 797: than we should have been capable of." [See _Ch'ien Han Shu_, ch. 34,
LINE 798: ff. 4, 5.] ]
LINE 799: 59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is
LINE 800: capable of striking a blow for victory.
LINE 801: [Danger has a bracing effect.]
LINE 802: 60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves
LINE 803: to the enemy's purpose.
LINE 804: [Ts'ao Kung says: "Feign stupidity"—by an appearance of yielding and
LINE 805: falling in with the enemy's wishes. Chang Yu's note makes the meaning
LINE 806: clear: "If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do
LINE 807: so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out
LINE 808: his intention." The object is to make him remiss and contemptuous
LINE 809: before we deliver our attack.]
LINE 810: 61. By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank,
LINE 811: [I understand the first four words to mean "accompanying the enemy in
LINE 812: one direction." Ts'ao Kung says: "unite the soldiers and make for the
LINE 813: enemy." But such a violent displacement of characters is quite
LINE 814: indefensible.]
LINE 815: we shall succeed in the long run
LINE 816: [Literally, "after a thousand _li_."]
LINE 817: in killing the commander-in-chief.
LINE 818: [Always a great point with the Chinese.]
LINE 819: 62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.
LINE 820: 63. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier
LINE 821: passes, destroy the official tallies,
LINE 822: [These were tablets of bamboo or wood, one half of which was issued as
LINE 823: a permit or passport by the official in charge of a gate. Cf. the
LINE 824: "border-warden" of _Lun Yu_ III. 24, who may have had similar duties.
LINE 825: When this half was returned to him, within a fixed period, he was
LINE 826: authorized to open the gate and let the traveler through.]
LINE 827: and stop the passage of all emissaries.
LINE 828: [Either to or from the enemy's country.]
LINE 829: 64. Be stern in the council-chamber,
LINE 830: [Show no weakness, and insist on your plans being ratified by the
LINE 831: sovereign.]
LINE 832: so that you may control the situation.
LINE 833: [Mei Yao-ch'en understands the whole sentence to mean: Take the
LINE 834: strictest precautions to ensure secrecy in your deliberations.]
LINE 835: 65. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.
LINE 836: 66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,
LINE 837: [Cf. _supra_, § 18.]
LINE 838: and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.
LINE 839: [Ch'en Hao's explanation: "If I manage to seize a favourable position,
LINE 840: but the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained
LINE 841: cannot be turned to any practical account. He who intends therefore, to
LINE 842: occupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an
LINE 843: artful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him
LINE 844: into going there as well." Mei Yao-ch'en explains that this "artful
LINE 845: appointment" is to be made through the medium of the enemy's own spies,
LINE 846: who will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to
LINE 847: give them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, "we must
LINE 848: manage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. §
LINE 849: 4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we
LINE 850: must arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble.
LINE 851: Taken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch'en's
LINE 852: interpretation of § 47.]
LINE 853: 67. Walk in the path defined by rule,
LINE 854: [Chia Lin says: "Victory is the only thing that matters, and this
LINE 855: cannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons." It is
LINE 856: unfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the
LINE 857: sense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory. Napoleon, as we
LINE 858: know, according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated, won
LINE 859: his battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare.]
LINE 860: and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive
LINE 861: battle.
LINE 862: [Tu Mu says: "Conform to the enemy's tactics until a favourable
LINE 863: opportunity offers; then come forth and engage in a battle that shall
LINE 864: prove decisive."]
LINE 865: 68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy
LINE 866: gives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running
LINE 867: hare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.
LINE 868: [As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity, the comparison hardly
LINE 869: appears felicitous. But of course Sun Tzŭ was thinking only of its
LINE 870: speed. The words have been taken to mean: You must flee from the enemy
LINE 871: as quickly as an escaping hare; but this is rightly rejected by Tu Mu.]
