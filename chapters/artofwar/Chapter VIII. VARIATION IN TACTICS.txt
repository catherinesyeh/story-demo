LINE 1: ng of the Chinese for the title of
LINE 2: this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple
LINE 3: selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in
LINE 4: his tent. See. § 26.]
LINE 5: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
LINE 6: 2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
LINE 7: ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
LINE 8: neglected.
LINE 9: 3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be
LINE 10: taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine
LINE 11: the conditions obtaining in the field.
LINE 12: 4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The
LINE 13: Commander; (5) Method and discipline.
LINE 14: [It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by "Moral Law" a
LINE 15: principle of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral
LINE 16: aspect. One might be tempted to render it by "morale," were it not
LINE 17: considered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in § 13.]
LINE 18: 5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with
LINE 19: their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,
LINE 20: undismayed by any danger.
LINE 21: [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "Without constant practice, the
LINE 22: officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;
LINE 23: without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute
LINE 24: when the crisis is at hand."]
LINE 25: 7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
LINE 26: [The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words
LINE 27: here. Meng Shih refers to "the hard and the soft, waxing and waning" of
LINE 28: Heaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is
LINE 29: "the general economy of Heaven," including the five elements, the four
LINE 30: seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]
LINE 31: 8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;
LINE 32: open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.
LINE 33: 9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,
LINE 34: benevolence, courage and strictness.
LINE 35: [The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or
LINE 36: benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,
LINE 37: or "proper feeling;" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here
LINE 38: "wisdom" and "sincerity" are put before "humanity or benevolence," and
LINE 39: the two military virtues of "courage" and "strictness" substituted for
LINE 40: "uprightness of mind" and "self-respect, self-control, or 'proper
LINE 41: feeling.'"]
LINE 42: 10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of
LINE 43: the army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the
LINE 44: officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the
LINE 45: army, and the control of military expenditure.
LINE 46: 11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows
LINE 47: them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.
LINE 48: 12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the
LINE 49: military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in
LINE 50: this wise:—
LINE 51: 13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
LINE 52: [I.e., "is in harmony with his subjects." Cf. § 5.]
LINE 53: (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?
LINE 54: (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?
LINE 55: [See §§ 7, 8]
LINE 56: (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
LINE 57: [Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts'ao Ts'ao (A.D. 155-220),
LINE 58: who was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his
LINE 59: own severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned
LINE 60: himself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of
LINE 61: corn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy
LINE 62: his sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts'ao Ts'ao's own comment
LINE 63: on the present passage is characteristically curt: "when you lay down a
LINE 64: law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must
LINE 65: be put to death."]
LINE 66: (5) Which army is the stronger?
LINE 67: [Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch'en puts it, freely
LINE 68: rendered, "_esprit de corps_ and 'big battalions.'"]
LINE 69: (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
LINE 70: [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "Without constant practice, the
LINE 71: officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;
LINE 72: without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute
LINE 73: when the crisis is at hand."]
LINE 74: (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and
LINE 75: punishment?
LINE 76: [On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be
LINE 77: properly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]
LINE 78: 14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or
LINE 79: defeat.
LINE 80: 15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will
LINE 81: conquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that
LINE 82: hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:—let
LINE 83: such a one be dismissed!
LINE 84: [The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzŭ's treatise was
LINE 85: composed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu
LINE 86: State.]
LINE 87: 16. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any
LINE 88: helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.
LINE 89: 17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one's
LINE 90: plans.
LINE 91: [Sun Tzŭ, as a practical soldier, will have none of the "bookish
LINE 92: theoric." He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract
LINE 93: principles; "for," as Chang Yu puts it, "while the main laws of
LINE 94: strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and
LINE 95: sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to
LINE 96: secure a favourable position in actual warfare." On the eve of the
LINE 97: battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the
LINE 98: Duke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations
LINE 99: were for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find
LINE 100: himself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a
LINE 101: critical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: "Who will
LINE 102: attack the first tomorrow—I or Bonaparte?" "Bonaparte," replied Lord
LINE 103: Uxbridge. "Well," continued the Duke, "Bonaparte has not given me any
LINE 104: idea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you
LINE 105: expect me to tell you what mine are?" [1] ]
LINE 106: 18. All warfare is based on deception.
LINE 107: [The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every
LINE 108: soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many
LINE 109: military qualities, was especially distinguished by "the extraordinary
LINE 110: skill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend
LINE 111: and foe."]
LINE 112: 19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our
LINE 113: forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy
LINE 114: believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are
LINE 115: near.
LINE 116: 20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
LINE 117: [All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, "When he is in disorder, crush
LINE 118: him." It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzŭ is still illustrating
LINE 119: the uses of deception in war.]
LINE 120: 21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in
LINE 121: superior strength, evade him.
LINE 122: 22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.
LINE 123: Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
LINE 124: [Wang Tzŭ, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his
LINE 125: adversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and
LINE 126: immobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.]
LINE 127: 23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
LINE 128: [This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch'en has the note: "while
LINE 129: we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out." The
LINE 130: _Yu Lan_ has "Lure him on and tire him out."]
LINE 131: If his forces are united, separate them.
LINE 132: [Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the
LINE 133: commentators: "If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division
LINE 134: between them."]
LINE 135: 24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not
LINE 136: expected.
LINE 137: 25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged
LINE 138: beforehand.
LINE 139: 26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his
LINE 140: temple ere the battle is fought.
LINE 141: [Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple
LINE 142: to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the
LINE 143: field, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]
LINE 144: The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.
LINE 145: Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to
LINE 146: defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this
LINE 147: point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
LINE 148: [1] "Words on Wellington," by Sir. W. Fraser.
LINE 149: Chapter II. WAGING WAR
LINE 150: [Ts'ao Kung has the note: "He who wishes to fight must first count the
LINE 151: cost," which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the
LINE 152: chapter is not what we might expect from the title, but is primarily a
LINE 153: consideration of ways and means.]
LINE 154: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field
LINE 155: a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred
LINE 156: thousand mail-clad soldiers,
LINE 157: [The "swift chariots" were lightly built and, according to Chang Yu,
LINE 158: used for the attack; the "heavy chariots" were heavier, and designed
LINE 159: for purposes of defence. Li Ch'uan, it is true, says that the latter
LINE 160: were light, but this seems hardly probable. It is interesting to note
LINE 161: the analogies between early Chinese warfare and that of the Homeric
LINE 162: Greeks. In each case, the war-chariot was the important factor, forming
LINE 163: as it did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of
LINE 164: foot-soldiers. With regard to the numbers given here, we are informed
LINE 165: that each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen, and each heavy
LINE 166: chariot by 25 footmen, so that the whole army would be divided up into
LINE 167: a thousand battalions, each consisting of two chariots and a hundred
LINE 168: men.]
LINE 169: with provisions enough to carry them a thousand _li_,
LINE 170: [2.78 modern _li_ go to a mile. The length may have varied slightly
LINE 171: since Sun Tzŭ's time.]
LINE 172: the expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of
LINE 173: guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots
LINE 174: and armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per
LINE 175: day. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.
LINE 176: 2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming,
LINE 177: the men's weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If
LINE 178: you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.
LINE 179: 3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State
LINE 180: will not be equal to the strain.
LINE 181: 4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength
LINE 182: exhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to
LINE 183: take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be
LINE 184: able to avert the consequences that must ensue.
LINE 185: 5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has
LINE 186: never been seen associated with long delays.
LINE 187: [This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of
LINE 188: the commentators. Ts'ao Kung, Li Ch'uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and
LINE 189: Mei Yao-ch'en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally
LINE 190: stupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho
LINE 191: Shih says: "Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure
LINE 192: of energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but
LINE 193: they bring calamity in their train." Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by
LINE 194: remarking: "Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being
LINE 195: expended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true
LINE 196: cleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities." Chang Yu
LINE 197: says: "So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable
LINE 198: to clever dilatoriness." Now Sun Tzŭ says nothing whatever, except
LINE 199: possibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than
LINE 200: ingenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much
LINE 201: more guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious,
LINE 202: tardiness can never be anything but foolish—if only because it means
LINE 203: impoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by
LINE 204: Sun Tzŭ, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur
LINE 205: to the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome
LINE 206: against that of Hannibals's isolated army, because it seemed to him
LINE 207: that the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a
LINE 208: strange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics
LINE 209: would have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is
LINE 210: true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption
LINE 211: in their favour.]
LINE 212: 6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged
LINE 213: warfare.
LINE 214: 7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war
LINE 215: that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.
LINE 216: [That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a
LINE 217: long war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it
LINE 218: to a close. Only two commentators seem to favour this interpretation,
LINE 219: but it fits well into the logic of the context, whereas the rendering,
LINE 220: "He who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits,"
LINE 221: is distinctly pointless.]
LINE 222: 8. The skilful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his
LINE 223: supply-waggons loaded more than twice.
LINE 224: [Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting for
LINE 225: reinforcements, nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies,
LINE 226: but crosses the enemy's frontier without delay. This may seem an
LINE 227: audacious policy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from
LINE 228: Julius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time—that is, being a
LINE 229: little ahead of your opponent—has counted for more than either
LINE 230: numerical superiority or the nicest calculations with regard to
LINE 231: commissariat.]
LINE 232: 9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus
LINE 233: the army will have food enough for its needs.
LINE 234: [The Chinese word translated here as "war material" literally means
LINE 235: "things to be used", and is meant in the widest sense. It includes all
LINE 236: the impedimenta of an army, apart from provisions.]
LINE 237: 10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by
LINE 238: contributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a
LINE 239: distance causes the people to be impoverished.
LINE 240: [The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the
LINE 241: next, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is
LINE 242: so awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text.
LINE 243: It never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may
LINE 244: be necessary for the sense, and we get no help from them there. The
LINE 245: Chinese words Sun Tzŭ used to indicate the cause of the people's
LINE 246: impoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the
LINE 247: husbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why
LINE 248: should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because
LINE 249: the State or Government is too poor to do so?]
LINE 250: 11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up;
LINE 251: and high prices cause the people's substance to be drained away.
LINE 252: [Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own
LINE 253: territory. Ts'ao Kung understands it of an army that has already
LINE 254: crossed the frontier.]
LINE 255: 12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be
LINE 256: afflicted by heavy exactions.
LINE 257: 13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the
LINE 258: homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their
LINE 259: incomes will be dissipated;
LINE 260: [Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10,
LINE 261: but of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from
LINE 262: our text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: "The _people_ being
LINE 263: regarded as the essential part of the State, and _food_ as the people's
LINE 264: heaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be
LINE 265: careful of both?"]
LINE 266: while Government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,
LINE 267: breast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,
LINE 268: protective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to
LINE 269: four-tenths of its total revenue.
LINE 270: 15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One
LINE 271: cartload of the enemy's provisions is equivalent to twenty of one's
LINE 272: own, and likewise a single _picul_ of his provender is equivalent to
LINE 273: twenty from one's own store.
LINE 274: [Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of
LINE 275: transporting one cartload to the front. A _picul_ is a unit of measure
LINE 276: equal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).]
LINE 277: 16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger;
LINE 278: that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have
LINE 279: their rewards.
LINE 280: [Tu Mu says: "Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see
LINE 281: the advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from
LINE 282: the enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have
LINE 283: a keen desire to fight, each on his own account."]
LINE 284: 17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been
LINE 285: taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags
LINE 286: should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled
LINE 287: and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be
LINE 288: kindly treated and kept.
LINE 289: 18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one's own
LINE 290: strength.
LINE 291: 19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy
LINE 292: campaigns.
LINE 293: [As Ho Shih remarks: "War is not a thing to be trifled with." Sun Tzŭ
LINE 294: here reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to
LINE 295: enforce."]
LINE 296: 20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of
LINE 297: the people's fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall
LINE 298: be in peace or in peril.
LINE 299: Chapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM
LINE 300: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is
LINE 301: to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it
LINE 302: is not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than
LINE 303: to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire
LINE 304: than to destroy them.
LINE 305: [The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted
LINE 306: nominally of 12500 men; according to Ts'ao Kung, the equivalent of a
LINE 307: regiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists
LINE 308: from any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company
LINE 309: contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives
LINE 310: the exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.]
LINE 311: 2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme
LINE 312: excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's
LINE 313: resistance without fighting.
LINE 314: [Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old
LINE 315: Chinese general. Moltke's greatest triumph, the capitulation of the
LINE 316: huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]
LINE 317: 3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy's plans;
LINE 318: [Perhaps the word "balk" falls short of expressing the full force of
LINE 319: the Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one
LINE 320: might be content to foil the enemy's stratagems one after another, but
LINE 321: an active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in
LINE 322: his note: "When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must
LINE 323: anticipate him by delivering our own attack first."]
LINE 324: the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces;
LINE 325: [Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzŭ, in
LINE 326: speaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or
LINE 327: principalities into which the China of his day was split up.]
LINE 328: the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;
LINE 329: [When he is already at full strength.]
LINE 330: and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
LINE 331: 4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be
LINE 332: avoided.
LINE 333: [Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in
LINE 334: 1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley,
LINE 335: Mafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would
LINE 336: have been masters of the situation before the British were ready
LINE 337: seriously to oppose them.]
LINE 338: The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements
LINE 339: of war, will take up three whole months;
LINE 340: [It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as
LINE 341: "mantlets", described. Ts'ao Kung simply defines them as "large
LINE 342: shields," but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch'uan, who says
LINE 343: they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city
LINE 344: walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman
LINE 345: _testudo_, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in
LINE 346: repelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch'en Hao. See _supra_ II. 14.
LINE 347: The name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the "movable
LINE 348: shelters" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators.
LINE 349: They were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled
LINE 350: from within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey
LINE 351: parties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the
LINE 352: encircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called "wooden
LINE 353: donkeys."]
LINE 354: and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three
LINE 355: months more.
LINE 356: [These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of
LINE 357: the enemy's walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence,
LINE 358: and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding
LINE 359: note.]
LINE 360: 5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men
LINE 361: to the assault like swarming ants,
LINE 362: [This vivid simile of Ts'ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army
LINE 363: of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing
LINE 364: patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the
LINE 365: place before his engines of war are ready.]
LINE 366: with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town
LINE 367: still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
LINE 368: [We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port
LINE 369: Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]
LINE 370: 6. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any
LINE 371: fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he
LINE 372: overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
LINE 373: [Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no
LINE 374: harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after
LINE 375: having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed "Father and mother
LINE 376: of the people."]
LINE 377: 7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire,
LINE 378: and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
LINE 379: [Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of
LINE 380: the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: "And thus,
LINE 381: the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect."]
LINE 382: This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
LINE 383: 8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to
LINE 384: surround him; if five to one, to attack him;
LINE 385: [Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]
LINE 386: if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
LINE 387: [Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it
LINE 388: appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts'ao Kung, however,
LINE 389: gives a clue to Sun Tzŭ's meaning: "Being two to the enemy's one, we
LINE 390: may use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some
LINE 391: special diversion." Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: "If our
LINE 392: force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up
LINE 393: into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall
LINE 394: upon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed
LINE 395: from behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front."
LINE 396: This is what is meant by saying that 'one part may be used in the
LINE 397: regular way, and the other for some special diversion.' Tu Mu does not
LINE 398: understand that dividing one's army is simply an irregular, just as
LINE 399: concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too
LINE 400: hasty in calling this a mistake."]
LINE 401: 9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;
LINE 402: [Li Ch'uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase: "If
LINE 403: attackers and attacked are equally matched in strength, only the able
LINE 404: general will fight."]
LINE 405: if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;
LINE 406: [The meaning, "we can _watch_ the enemy," is certainly a great
LINE 407: improvement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very
LINE 408: good authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying
LINE 409: only applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in
LINE 410: numbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and
LINE 411: discipline.]
LINE 412: if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
LINE 413: 10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in
LINE 414: the end it must be captured by the larger force.
LINE 415: 11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is
LINE 416: complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is
LINE 417: defective, the State will be weak.
LINE 418: [As Li Ch'uan tersely puts it: "Gap indicates deficiency; if the
LINE 419: general's ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed
LINE 420: in his profession), his army will lack strength."]
LINE 421: 12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his
LINE 422: army:—
LINE 423: 13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant
LINE 424: of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.
LINE 425: [Li Ch'uan adds the comment: "It is like tying together the legs of a
LINE 426: thoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop." One would naturally
LINE 427: think of "the ruler" in this passage as being at home, and trying to
LINE 428: direct the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators
LINE 429: understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T'ai Kung: "A
LINE 430: kingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be
LINE 431: directed from within." Of course it is true that, during an engagement,
LINE 432: or when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the
LINE 433: thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he
LINE 434: will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong
LINE 435: orders.]
LINE 436: 14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he
LINE 437: administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in
LINE 438: an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
LINE 439: [Ts'ao Kung's note is, freely translated: "The military sphere and the
LINE 440: civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can't handle an army in kid
LINE 441: gloves." And Chang Yu says: "Humanity and justice are the principles on
LINE 442: which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility,
LINE 443: on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate
LINE 444: the governing of an army"—to that of a State, understood.]
LINE 445: 15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,
LINE 446: [That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]
LINE 447: through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to
LINE 448: circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
LINE 449: [I follow Mei Yao-ch'en here. The other commentators refer not to the
LINE 450: ruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu
LINE 451: says: "If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he
LINE 452: must not be entrusted with a position of authority." Tu Mu quotes: "The
LINE 453: skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the
LINE 454: covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in
LINE 455: establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in
LINE 456: action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid
LINE 457: man has no fear of death."]
LINE 458: 16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to
LINE 459: come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy
LINE 460: into the army, and flinging victory away.
LINE 461: 17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He
LINE 462: will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
LINE 463: [Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive;
LINE 464: if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will
LINE 465: invariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive
LINE 466: or the defensive.]
LINE 467: (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior
LINE 468: forces.
LINE 469: [This is not merely the general's ability to estimate numbers
LINE 470: correctly, as Li Ch'uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the
LINE 471: saying more satisfactorily: "By applying the art of war, it is possible
LINE 472: with a lesser force to defeat a greater, and _vice versa_. The secret
LINE 473: lies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.
LINE 474: Thus Wu Tzŭ says: 'With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an
LINE 475: inferior one, make for difficult ground.'"]
LINE 476: (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout
LINE 477: all its ranks.
LINE 478: (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy
LINE 479: unprepared.
LINE 480: (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by
LINE 481: the sovereign.
LINE 482: [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "It is the sovereign's function to
LINE 483: give broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of
LINE 484: the general." It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which
LINE 485: have been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on
LINE 486: the part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his
LINE 487: extraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central
LINE 488: authority.]
LINE 489: Victory lies in the knowledge of these five points.
LINE 490: [Literally, "These five things are knowledge of the principle of
LINE 491: victory."]
LINE 492: 18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need
LINE 493: not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not
LINE 494: the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
LINE 495: [Li Ch'uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch'in, who in 383 A.D.
LINE 496: marched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to
LINE 497: despise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An
LINE 498: and Huan Ch'ung, he boastfully replied: "I have the population of eight
LINE 499: provinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one
LINE 500: million; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely
LINE 501: throwing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?"
LINE 502: Nevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei
LINE 503: River, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.]
LINE 504: If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every
LINE 505: battle.
LINE 506: [Chang Yu said: "Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive,
LINE 507: knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive." He adds:
LINE 508: "Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an
LINE 509: attack." It would be hard to find a better epitome of the
LINE 510: root-principle of war.]
LINE 511: Chapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS
LINE 512: [Ts'ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for the title of
LINE 513: this chapter: "marching and countermarching on the part of the two
LINE 514: armies with a view to discovering each other's condition." Tu Mu says:
LINE 515: "It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be
LINE 516: discovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain
LINE 517: secret, which leads to victory; show your dispositions, and your
LINE 518: condition will become patent, which leads to defeat." Wang Hsi remarks
LINE 519: that the good general can "secure success by modifying his tactics to
LINE 520: meet those of the enemy."]
LINE 521: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond
LINE 522: the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of
LINE 523: defeating the enemy.
LINE 524: 2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the
LINE 525: opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
LINE 526: [That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy's part.]
LINE 527: 3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,
LINE 528: [Chang Yu says this is done, "By concealing the disposition of his
LINE 529: troops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions."]
LINE 530: but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
LINE 531: 4. Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able
LINE 532: to _do_ it.
LINE 533: 5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat
LINE 534: the enemy means taking the offensive.
LINE 535: [I retain the sense found in a similar passage in §§ 1-3, in spite of
LINE 536: the fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they
LINE 537: give, "He who cannot conquer takes the defensive," is plausible
LINE 538: enough.]
LINE 539: 6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;
LINE 540: attacking, a superabundance of strength.
LINE 541: 7. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret
LINE 542: recesses of the earth;
LINE 543: [Literally, "hides under the ninth earth," which is a metaphor
LINE 544: indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may
LINE 545: not know his whereabouts."]
LINE 546: he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of
LINE 547: heaven.
LINE 548: [Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a
LINE 549: thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the
LINE 550: opinion of most of the commentators.]
LINE 551: Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the
LINE 552: other, a victory that is complete.
LINE 553: 8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is
LINE 554: not the acme of excellence.
LINE 555: [As Ts'ao Kung remarks, "the thing is to see the plant before it has
LINE 556: germinated," to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li
LINE 557: Ch'uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the
LINE 558: vastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city
LINE 559: of Ch'eng-an, said to his officers: "Gentlemen, we are going to
LINE 560: annihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner." The officers
LINE 561: hardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But
LINE 562: Han Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever
LINE 563: stratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and
LINE 564: inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary."]
LINE 565: 9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and
LINE 566: the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
LINE 567: [True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: "To plan secretly, to move
LINE 568: surreptitiously, to foil the enemy's intentions and balk his schemes,
LINE 569: so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood."
LINE 570: Sun Tzŭ reserves his approbation for things that
LINE 571: "the world's coarse thumb
LINE 572: And finger fail to plumb."
LINE 573: 10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;
LINE 574: ["Autumn hair" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in
LINE 575: autumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one
LINE 576: in Chinese writers.]
LINE 577: to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of
LINE 578: thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
LINE 579: [Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick
LINE 580: hearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu,
LINE 581: who at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a
LINE 582: mustard seed; and Shih K'uang, a blind musician who could hear the
LINE 583: footsteps of a mosquito.]
LINE 584: 11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,
LINE 585: but excels in winning with ease.
LINE 586: [The last half is literally "one who, conquering, excels in easy
LINE 587: conquering." Mei Yao-ch'en says: "He who only sees the obvious, wins
LINE 588: his battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things,
LINE 589: wins with ease."]
LINE 590: 12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor
LINE 591: credit for courage.
LINE 592: [Tu Mu explains this very well: "Inasmuch as his victories are gained
LINE 593: over circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large
LINE 594: knows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch
LINE 595: as the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he
LINE 596: receives no credit for courage."]
LINE 597: 13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
LINE 598: [Ch'en Hao says: "He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile
LINE 599: attacks." The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu: "One
LINE 600: who seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at
LINE 601: winning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished;
LINE 602: whereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are
LINE 603: not yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably
LINE 604: win."]
LINE 605: Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it
LINE 606: means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
LINE 607: 14. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes
LINE 608: defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the
LINE 609: enemy.
LINE 610: [A "counsel of perfection" as Tu Mu truly observes. "Position" need not
LINE 611: be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes
LINE 612: all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to
LINE 613: increase the safety of his army.]
LINE 614: 15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle
LINE 615: after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat
LINE 616: first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
LINE 617: [Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: "In warfare, first lay plans which
LINE 618: will ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not
LINE 619: begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no
LINE 620: longer be assured."]
LINE 621: 16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly
LINE 622: adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control
LINE 623: success.
LINE 624: 17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;
LINE 625: secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,
LINE 626: Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.
LINE 627: 18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to
LINE 628: Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of
LINE 629: chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
LINE 630: [It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the
LINE 631: Chinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,
LINE 632: which enable us to form an estimate of the enemy's strength, and to
LINE 633: make calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a
LINE 634: general weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy's chances with our own;
LINE 635: if the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty
LINE 636: lies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a
LINE 637: calculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the
LINE 638: second term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a
LINE 639: consideration of the enemy's general position or condition, while the
LINE 640: third term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other
LINE 641: hand, Tu Mu says: "The question of relative strength having been
LINE 642: settled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play." Ho
LINE 643: Shih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to
LINE 644: the third term as being a calculation of numbers.]
LINE 645: 19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight
LINE 646: placed in the scale against a single grain.
LINE 647: [Literally, "a victorious army is like an _i_ (20 oz.) weighed against
LINE 648: a _shu_ (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a _shu_ weighed against an _i_."
LINE 649: The point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force,
LINE 650: flushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his
LINE 651: note on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the _i_ to be 24 Chinese ounces,
LINE 652: and corrects Chu Hsi's statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li
LINE 653: Ch'uan of the T'ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]
LINE 654: 20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up
LINE 655: waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical
LINE 656: dispositions.
LINE 657: Chapter V. ENERGY
LINE 658: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as
LINE 659: the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their
LINE 660: numbers.
LINE 661: [That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with
LINE 662: subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin's
LINE 663: famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: "How large
LINE 664: an army do you think I could lead?" "Not more than 100,000 men, your
LINE 665: Majesty." "And you?" asked the Emperor. "Oh!" he answered, "the more
LINE 666: the better."]
LINE 667: 2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different
LINE 668: from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting
LINE 669: signs and signals.
LINE 670: 3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the
LINE 671: enemy's attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct
LINE 672: and indirect.
LINE 673: [We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ's
LINE 674: treatise, the discussion of the _cheng_ and the _ch'i_." As it is by no
LINE 675: means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to
LINE 676: render them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well
LINE 677: to tabulate some of the commentators' remarks on the subject before
LINE 678: proceeding further. Li Ch'uan: "Facing the enemy is _cheng_, making
LINE 679: lateral diversion is _ch'i_. Chia Lin: "In presence of the enemy, your
LINE 680: troops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure
LINE 681: victory abnormal manœuvers must be employed." Mei Yao-ch'en: "_Ch'i_ is
LINE 682: active, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity,
LINE 683: activity brings the victory itself." Ho Shih: "We must cause the enemy
LINE 684: to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed,
LINE 685: and vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch'i_, and _ch'i_ may also be
LINE 686: _cheng_." He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when
LINE 687: marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly
LINE 688: threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly
LINE 689: disconcerting his opponent. [Ch'ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,
LINE 690: the march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise manœuver was
LINE 691: _ch'i_." Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:
LINE 692: "Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch'i_ and
LINE 693: _cheng_. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: 'Direct warfare favours
LINE 694: frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.' Ts'ao Kung
LINE 695: says: 'Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation;
LINE 696: appearing on the enemy's rear is an indirect manœuver.' Li Wei-kung
LINE 697: [6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: 'In war, to march straight ahead is
LINE 698: _cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch'i_.' These
LINE 699: writers simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch'i_ as _ch'i_; they do
LINE 700: not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each
LINE 701: other like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on
LINE 702: the T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: 'A _ch'i_
LINE 703: manœuver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;
LINE 704: then our real attack will be _ch'i_, and vice versa. The whole secret
LINE 705: lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real
LINE 706: intent.'" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other
LINE 707: operation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;
LINE 708: whereas that is _ch'i_," which takes him by surprise or comes from an
LINE 709: unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to
LINE 710: be _ch'i_," it immediately becomes _cheng_."]
LINE 711: 4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against
LINE 712: an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
LINE 713: 5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,
LINE 714: but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.
LINE 715: [Chang Yu says: "Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding
LINE 716: the enemy's flanks or falling on his rear." A brilliant example of
LINE 717: "indirect tactics" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord
LINE 718: Roberts' night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.
LINE 719: [1]
LINE 720: 6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven
LINE 721: and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and
LINE 722: moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away
LINE 723: but to return once more.
LINE 724: [Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of _ch'i_ and
LINE 725: _cheng_. But at present Sun Tzŭ is not speaking of _cheng_ at all,
LINE 726: unless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating
LINE 727: to it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been
LINE 728: pointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military
LINE 729: operations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply
LINE 730: have an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite
LINE 731: resource of a great leader.]
LINE 732: 7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of
LINE 733: these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.
LINE 734: 8. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red,
LINE 735: white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can
LINE 736: ever be seen.
LINE 737: 9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt,
LINE 738: sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can
LINE 739: ever be tasted.
LINE 740: 10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct
LINE 741: and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless
LINE 742: series of manœuvers.
LINE 743: 11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is
LINE 744: like moving in a circle—you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the
LINE 745: possibilities of their combination?
LINE 746: 12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even
LINE 747: roll stones along in its course.
LINE 748: 13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon
LINE 749: which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
LINE 750: [The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is
LINE 751: used defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word
LINE 752: as "the measurement or estimation of distance." But this meaning does
LINE 753: not quite fit the illustrative simile in §. 15. Applying this
LINE 754: definition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of
LINE 755: _self-restraint_ which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until
LINE 756: the right moment, together with the power of judging when the right
LINE 757: moment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly
LINE 758: important one of being able to reserve their fire until the very
LINE 759: instant at which it will be most effective. When the "Victory" went
LINE 760: into action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for
LINE 761: several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying
LINE 762: with a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close
LINE 763: range, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on
LINE 764: the enemy's nearest ships.]
LINE 765: 14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and
LINE 766: prompt in his decision.
LINE 767: [The word "decision" would have reference to the measurement of
LINE 768: distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking.
LINE 769: But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzŭ meant to use the word in a
LINE 770: figurative sense comparable to our own idiom "short and sharp." Cf.
LINE 771: Wang Hsi's note, which after describing the falcon's mode of attack,
LINE 772: proceeds: "This is just how the 'psychological moment' should be seized
LINE 773: in war."]
LINE 774: 15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to
LINE 775: the releasing of the trigger.
LINE 776: [None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of
LINE 777: energy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by
LINE 778: the finger on the trigger.]
LINE 779: 16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming
LINE 780: disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos,
LINE 781: your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against
LINE 782: defeat.
LINE 783: [Mei Yao-ch'en says: "The subdivisions of the army having been
LINE 784: previously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating
LINE 785: and joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the
LINE 786: course of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real
LINE 787: disorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your
LINE 788: dispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out
LINE 789: of the question."]
LINE 790: 17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear
LINE 791: postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.
LINE 792: [In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone
LINE 793: down the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts'ao Kung throws
LINE 794: out a hint of the meaning in his brief note: "These things all serve to
LINE 795: destroy formation and conceal one's condition." But Tu Mu is the first
LINE 796: to put it quite plainly: "If you wish to feign confusion in order to
LINE 797: lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish
LINE 798: to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme
LINE 799: courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy
LINE 800: over-confident, you must have exceeding strength."]
LINE 801: 18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of
LINE 802: subdivision;
LINE 803: [See _supra_, § 1.]
LINE 804: concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of
LINE 805: latent energy;
LINE 806: [The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here
LINE 807: differently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:
LINE 808: "seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the
LINE 809: enemy will believe that we are really afraid."]
LINE 810: masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical
LINE 811: dispositions.
LINE 812: [Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han
LINE 813: Emperor: "Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report
LINE 814: on their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed
LINE 815: all their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm
LINE 816: soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one
LINE 817: and all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone
LINE 818: opposed them, saying: 'When two countries go to war, they are naturally
LINE 819: inclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our
LINE 820: spies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some
LINE 821: _ruse_ on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to
LINE 822: attack.' The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the
LINE 823: trap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng."]
LINE 824: 19. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains
LINE 825: deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.
LINE 826: [Ts'ao Kung's note is "Make a display of weakness and want." Tu Mu
LINE 827: says: "If our force happens to be superior to the enemy's, weakness may
LINE 828: be simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led
LINE 829: to believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact,
LINE 830: all the enemy's movements should be determined by the signs that we
LINE 831: choose to give him." Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a
LINE 832: descendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch'i State being at war with
LINE 833: Wei, sent T'ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P'ang Chuan, who
LINE 834: happened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: "The
LINE 835: Ch'i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary
LINE 836: despises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account." Accordingly,
LINE 837: when the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders
LINE 838: to show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the
LINE 839: night after only 20,000. P'ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to
LINE 840: himself: "I knew these men of Ch'i were cowards: their numbers have
LINE 841: already fallen away by more than half." In his retreat, Sun Pin came to
LINE 842: a narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach
LINE 843: after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon
LINE 844: it the words: "Under this tree shall P'ang Chuan die." Then, as night
LINE 845: began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by,
LINE 846: with orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P'ang
LINE 847: Chuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in
LINE 848: order to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled
LINE 849: by a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The
LINE 850: above is Tu Mu's version of the story; the _Shih Chi_, less
LINE 851: dramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P'ang Chuan
LINE 852: cut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of
LINE 853: his army.] ]
LINE 854: He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.
LINE 855: 20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body
LINE 856: of picked men he lies in wait for him.
LINE 857: [With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, "He lies in
LINE 858: wait with the main body of his troops."]
LINE 859: 21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and
LINE 860: does not require too much from individuals.
LINE 861: [Tu Mu says: "He first of all considers the power of his army in the
LINE 862: bulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each
LINE 863: men according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from
LINE 864: the untalented."]
LINE 865: Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined
LINE 866: energy.
LINE 867: 22. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it
LINE 868: were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or
LINE 869: stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a
LINE 870: slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,
LINE 871: to go rolling down.
LINE 872: [Ts'au Kung calls this "the use of natural or inherent power."]
LINE 873: 23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum
LINE 874: of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So
LINE 875: much on the subject of energy.
LINE 876: [The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu's opinion, is the paramount
LINE 877: importance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. "Great
LINE 878: results," he adds, "can thus be achieved with small forces."]
LINE 879: [1] "Forty-one Years in India," chapter 46.
LINE 880: Chapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG
LINE 881: [Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:
LINE 882: "Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the
LINE 883: defensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect
LINE 884: methods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of
LINE 885: attack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect
LINE 886: methods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods
LINE 887: before proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use
LINE 888: of direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the
LINE 889: perception of weak and strong points depends again on the above
LINE 890: methods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter
LINE 891: on Energy."]
LINE 892: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of
LINE 893: the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field
LINE 894: and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.
LINE 895: 2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but
LINE 896: does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
LINE 897: [One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or
LINE 898: fights not at all. [1] ]
LINE 899: 3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach
LINE 900: of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible
LINE 901: for the enemy to draw near.
LINE 902: [In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he
LINE 903: will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to
LINE 904: defend.]
LINE 905: 4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;
LINE 906: [This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch'en's
LINE 907: interpretation of I. § 23.]
LINE 908: if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,
LINE 909: he can force him to move.
LINE 910: 5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march
LINE 911: swiftly to places where you are not expected.
LINE 912: 6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches
LINE 913: through country where the enemy is not.
LINE 914: [Ts'ao Kung sums up very well: "Emerge from the void [q.d. like "a bolt
LINE 915: from the blue"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are
LINE 916: defended, attack in unexpected quarters."]
LINE 917: 7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack
LINE 918: places which are undefended.
LINE 919: [Wang Hsi explains "undefended places" as "weak points; that is to say,
LINE 920: where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit;
LINE 921: where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict
LINE 922: enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or
LINE 923: the defenders are variance amongst themselves."]
LINE 924: You can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions
LINE 925: that cannot be attacked.
LINE 926: [_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There
LINE 927: is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later
LINE 928: clause. Tu Mu, Ch'en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch'en assume the meaning to be:
LINE 929: "In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those
LINE 930: places that are not likely to be attacked;" and Tu Mu adds: "How much
LINE 931: more, then, those that will be attacked." Taken thus, however, the
LINE 932: clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in
LINE 933: the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang
LINE 934: Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: "He who is
LINE 935: skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see
LINE 936: IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This
LINE 937: being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the
LINE 938: enemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most
LINE 939: secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to
LINE 940: estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold
LINE 941: are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack."]
LINE 942: 8. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not
LINE 943: know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does
LINE 944: not know what to attack.
LINE 945: [An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]
LINE 946: 9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be
LINE 947: invisible, through you inaudible;
LINE 948: [Literally, "without form or sound," but it is said of course with
LINE 949: reference to the enemy.]
LINE 950: and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
LINE 951: 10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the
LINE 952: enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your
LINE 953: movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
LINE 954: 11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even
LINE 955: though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we
LINE 956: need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
LINE 957: [Tu Mu says: "If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line
LINE 958: of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return;
LINE 959: if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign
LINE 960: himself." It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late
LINE 961: Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]
LINE 962: 12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging
LINE 963: us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the
LINE 964: ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in
LINE 965: his way.
LINE 966: [This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia
LINE 967: Lin: "even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch." Li
LINE 968: Ch'uan says: "we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;" and
LINE 969: Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one
LINE 970: of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p'ing and about to be attacked
LINE 971: by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the
LINE 972: drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in
LINE 973: sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the
LINE 974: intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off
LINE 975: his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is
LINE 976: nothing more nor less than the timely use of "bluff."]
LINE 977: 13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible
LINE 978: ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must
LINE 979: be divided.
LINE 980: [The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei
LINE 981: Yao-ch'en) rightly explains it thus: "If the enemy's dispositions are
LINE 982: visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions
LINE 983: being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in
LINE 984: order to guard against attack from every quarter."]
LINE 985: 14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up
LINE 986: into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate
LINE 987: parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
LINE 988: 15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior
LINE 989: one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
LINE 990: 16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then
LINE 991: the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several
LINE 992: different points;
LINE 993: [Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's victories by
LINE 994: saying that "while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering
LINE 995: what he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to
LINE 996: do himself."]
LINE 997: and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers
LINE 998: we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.
LINE 999: 17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;
LINE 1000: should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he
LINE 1001: strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his
LINE 1002: right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,
LINE 1003: he will everywhere be weak.
LINE 1004: [In Frederick the Great's _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: "A
LINE 1005: defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those
LINE 1006: generals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every
LINE 1007: point, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,
LINE 1008: having only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,
LINE 1009: and acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater."]
LINE 1010: 18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible
LINE 1011: attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make
LINE 1012: these preparations against us.
LINE 1013: [The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is "to compel the
LINE 1014: enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force
LINE 1015: against each fraction in turn."]
LINE 1016: 19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may
LINE 1017: concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.
LINE 1018: [What Sun Tzŭ evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of
LINE 1019: distances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a
LINE 1020: general to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,
LINE 1021: and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the
LINE 1022: right hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.
LINE 1023: Among many such successful junctions which military history records,
LINE 1024: one of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher
LINE 1025: just at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]
LINE 1026: 20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be
LINE 1027: impotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the
LINE 1028: left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the
LINE 1029: van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything
LINE 1030: under a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by
LINE 1031: several _li_!
LINE 1032: [The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,
LINE 1033: but the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an
LINE 1034: army advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of
LINE 1035: which has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the
LINE 1036: various detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise
LINE 1037: instructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be
LINE 1038: able to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu's note may be worth
LINE 1039: quoting here: "If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to
LINE 1040: concentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will
LINE 1041: be forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we
LINE 1042: hold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall
LINE 1043: be brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support
LINE 1044: will be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there
LINE 1045: is any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of
LINE 1046: the army."]
LINE 1047: 21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own
LINE 1048: in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.
LINE 1049: I say then that victory can be achieved.
LINE 1050: [Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended
LINE 1051: in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its
LINE 1052: incorporation in Yüeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzŭ's death.
LINE 1053: With his present assertion compare IV. § 4. Chang Yu is the only one to
LINE 1054: point out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain:
LINE 1055: "In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, 'One may _know_
LINE 1056: how to conquer without being able to _do_ it,' whereas here we have the
LINE 1057: statement that 'victory' can be achieved.' The explanation is, that in
LINE 1058: the former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under
LINE 1059: discussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot
LINE 1060: make certain of beating him. But the present passage refers
LINE 1061: particularly to the soldiers of Yüeh who, according to Sun Tzŭ's
LINE 1062: calculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the
LINE 1063: impending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be
LINE 1064: achieved."]
LINE 1065: 22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from
LINE 1066: fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of
LINE 1067: their success.
LINE 1068: [An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: "Know beforehand all
LINE 1069: plans conducive to our success and to the enemy's failure."
LINE 1070: 23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.
LINE 1071: [Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy
LINE 1072: on being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his
LINE 1073: policy is to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku
LINE 1074: Liang, who sent the scornful present of a woman's head-dress to Ssu-ma
LINE 1075: I, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.]
LINE 1076: Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.
LINE 1077: 24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may
LINE 1078: know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.
LINE 1079: [Cf. IV. § 6.]
LINE 1080: 25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain
LINE 1081: is to conceal them;
LINE 1082: [The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is
LINE 1083: perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see _supra_ § 9) as "showing
LINE 1084: no sign" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your
LINE 1085: brain.]
LINE 1086: conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the
LINE 1087: subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
LINE 1088: [Tu Mu explains: "Though the enemy may have clever and capable
LINE 1089: officers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us."]
LINE 1090: 26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own
LINE 1091: tactics—that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
LINE 1092: 27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can
LINE 1093: see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
LINE 1094: [_I.e._, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they
LINE 1095: cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has
LINE 1096: preceded the battle.]
LINE 1097: 28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but
LINE 1098: let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
LINE 1099: [As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: "There is but one root-principle
LINE 1100: underlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in
LINE 1101: number." With this compare Col. Henderson: "The rules of strategy are
LINE 1102: few and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by
LINE 1103: familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no
LINE 1104: more teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of
LINE 1105: grammar will teach him to write like Gibbon."]
LINE 1106: 29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural
LINE 1107: course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
LINE 1108: 30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what
LINE 1109: is weak.
LINE 1110: [Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]
LINE 1111: 31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over
LINE 1112: which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the
LINE 1113: foe whom he is facing.
LINE 1114: 32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare
LINE 1115: there are no constant conditions.
LINE 1116: 33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and
LINE 1117: thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
LINE 1118: 34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always
LINE 1119: equally predominant;
LINE 1120: [That is, as Wang Hsi says: "they predominate alternately."]
LINE 1121: the four seasons make way for each other in turn.
LINE 1122: [Literally, "have no invariable seat."]
LINE 1123: There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and
LINE 1124: waxing.
LINE 1125: [Cf. V. § 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the
LINE 1126: want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature.
LINE 1127: The comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of
LINE 1128: the phenomena which Sun Tzŭ mentions is by no means paralleled in war.]
LINE 1129: [1] See Col. Henderson's biography of Stonewall Jackson, 1902 ed., vol.
LINE 1130: II, p. 490.
LINE 1131: Chapter VII. MANŒUVERING
LINE 1132: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the
LINE 1133: sovereign.
LINE 1134: 2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend
LINE 1135: and harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.
LINE 1136: ["Chang Yu says: "the establishment of harmony and confidence between
LINE 1137: the higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;" and he
LINE 1138: quotes a saying of Wu Tzŭ (chap. 1 ad init.): "Without harmony in the
LINE 1139: State, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the
LINE 1140: army, no battle array can be formed." In an historical romance Sun Tzŭ
LINE 1141: is represented as saying to Wu Yuan: "As a general rule, those who are
LINE 1142: waging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before
LINE 1143: proceeding to attack the external foe."]
LINE 1144: 3. After that, comes tactical manœuvering, than which there is nothing
LINE 1145: more difficult.
LINE 1146: [I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts'ao
LINE 1147: Kung, who says: "From the time of receiving the sovereign's
LINE 1148: instructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics
LINE 1149: to be pursued are most difficult." It seems to me that the tactics or
LINE 1150: manœuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth
LINE 1151: and encamped, and Ch'ien Hao's note gives color to this view: "For
LINE 1152: levying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are
LINE 1153: plenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we
LINE 1154: engage in tactical operations." Tu Yu also observes that "the great
LINE 1155: difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favourable
LINE 1156: position."]
LINE 1157: The difficulty of tactical manœuvering consists in turning the devious
LINE 1158: into the direct, and misfortune into gain.
LINE 1159: [This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat
LINE 1160: enigmatical expressions of which Sun Tzŭ is so fond. This is how it is
LINE 1161: explained by Ts'ao Kung: "Make it appear that you are a long way off,
LINE 1162: then cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your
LINE 1163: opponent." Tu Mu says: "Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss
LINE 1164: and leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed." Ho Shih
LINE 1165: gives a slightly different turn: "Although you may have difficult
LINE 1166: ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a
LINE 1167: drawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of
LINE 1168: movement." Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two
LINE 1169: famous passages across the Alps—that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at
LINE 1170: his mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which
LINE 1171: resulted in the great victory of Marengo.]
LINE 1172: 4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy
LINE 1173: out of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the
LINE 1174: goal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of _deviation_.
LINE 1175: [Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the
LINE 1176: town of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch'in army. The King of
LINE 1177: Chao first consulted Lien P'o on the advisability of attempting a
LINE 1178: relief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the
LINE 1179: intervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned
LINE 1180: to Chao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but
LINE 1181: finally said: "We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole—and the
LINE 1182: pluckier one will win!" So he left the capital with his army, but had
LINE 1183: only gone a distance of 30 _li_ when he stopped and began throwing up
LINE 1184: entrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his
LINE 1185: fortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence
LINE 1186: to the enemy. The Ch'in general was overjoyed, and attributed his
LINE 1187: adversary's tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the
LINE 1188: Han State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies
LINE 1189: had no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for
LINE 1190: two days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such
LINE 1191: astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position
LINE 1192: on the "North hill" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A
LINE 1193: crushing defeat followed for the Ch'in forces, who were obliged to
LINE 1194: raise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.]
LINE 1195: 5. Manœuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined
LINE 1196: multitude, most dangerous.
LINE 1197: [I adopt the reading of the _T'ung Tien_, Cheng Yu-hsien and the _T'u
LINE 1198: Shu_, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to
LINE 1199: make sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to
LINE 1200: mean that manœuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all
LINE 1201: depends on the ability of the general.]
LINE 1202: 6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an
LINE 1203: advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other
LINE 1204: hand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice
LINE 1205: of its baggage and stores.
LINE 1206: [Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese
LINE 1207: commentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering
LINE 1208: without much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated
LINE 1209: corruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tzŭ does not
LINE 1210: approve of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf.
LINE 1211: infra, § 11.]
LINE 1212: 7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make
LINE 1213: forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual
LINE 1214: distance at a stretch,
LINE 1215: [The ordinary day's march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one
LINE 1216: occasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts'ao Ts'ao is said to have covered
LINE 1217: the incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]
LINE 1218: doing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all
LINE 1219: your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.
LINE 1220: 8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,
LINE 1221: and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its
LINE 1222: destination.
LINE 1223: [The moral is, as Ts'ao Kung and others point out: Don't march a
LINE 1224: hundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without
LINE 1225: impedimenta. Manœuvers of this description should be confined to short
LINE 1226: distances. Stonewall Jackson said: "The hardships of forced marches are
LINE 1227: often more painful than the dangers of battle." He did not often call
LINE 1228: upon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he
LINE 1229: intended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he
LINE 1230: sacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]
LINE 1231: 9. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outmanœuver the enemy, you will
LINE 1232: lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will
LINE 1233: reach the goal.
LINE 1234: [Literally, "the leader of the first division will be _torn away_."]
LINE 1235: 10. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your
LINE 1236: army will arrive.
LINE 1237: [In the _T'ung Tien_ is added: "From this we may know the difficulty of
LINE 1238: manœuvering."]
LINE 1239: 11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;
LINE 1240: without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.
LINE 1241: [I think Sun Tzŭ meant "stores accumulated in dépôts." But Tu Yu says
LINE 1242: "fodder and the like," Chang Yu says "Goods in general," and Wang Hsi
LINE 1243: says "fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc."]
LINE 1244: 12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the
LINE 1245: designs of our neighbours.
LINE 1246: 13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar
LINE 1247: with the face of the country—its mountains and forests, its pitfalls
LINE 1248: and precipices, its marshes and swamps.
LINE 1249: 14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we
LINE 1250: make use of local guides.
LINE 1251: [§§. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. § 52.]
LINE 1252: 15. In war, practise dissimulation, and you will succeed.
LINE 1253: [In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to
LINE 1254: the numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position.
LINE 1255: [2] ]
LINE 1256: Move only if there is a real advantage to be gained.
LINE 1257: 16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by
LINE 1258: circumstances.
LINE 1259: 17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,
LINE 1260: [The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift
LINE 1261: but, as Mei Yao-ch'en points out, "invisible and leaves no tracks."]
LINE 1262: your compactness that of the forest.
LINE 1263: [Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: "When slowly marching,
LINE 1264: order and ranks must be preserved"—so as to guard against surprise
LINE 1265: attacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do
LINE 1266: generally possess the quality of density or compactness.]
LINE 1267: 18. In raiding and plundering be like fire,
LINE 1268: [Cf. _Shih Ching_, IV. 3. iv. 6: "Fierce as a blazing fire which no man
LINE 1269: can check."]
LINE 1270: in immovability like a mountain.
LINE 1271: [That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to
LINE 1272: dislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice
LINE 1273: you into a trap.]
LINE 1274: 19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you
LINE 1275: move, fall like a thunderbolt.
LINE 1276: [Tu Yu quotes a saying of T'ai Kung which has passed into a proverb:
LINE 1277: "You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the
LINE 1278: lighting—so rapid are they." Likewise, an attack should be made so
LINE 1279: quickly that it cannot be parried.]
LINE 1280: 20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst
LINE 1281: your men;
LINE 1282: [Sun Tzŭ wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by
LINE 1283: insisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may
LINE 1284: afterwards be fairly divided amongst all.]
LINE 1285: when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the
LINE 1286: benefit of the soldiery.
LINE 1287: [Ch'en Hao says "quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow
LINE 1288: and plant it." It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the
LINE 1289: lands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out
LINE 1290: some of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that
LINE 1291: of Pan Ch'ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years,
LINE 1292: those of Fu-k'ang-an and Tso Tsung-t'ang.]
LINE 1293: 21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.
LINE 1294: [Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tzŭ as saying that we must not break camp
LINE 1295: until we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the
LINE 1296: cleverness of the opposing general. Cf. the "seven comparisons" in I. §
LINE 1297: 13.]
LINE 1298: 22. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.
LINE 1299: [See _supra_, §§ 3, 4.]
LINE 1300: Such is the art of manœuvering.
LINE 1301: [With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But
LINE 1302: there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an
LINE 1303: earlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the time when
LINE 1304: Sun Tzŭ wrote. The style of this fragment is not noticeably different
LINE 1305: from that of Sun Tzŭ himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to
LINE 1306: its genuineness.]
LINE 1307: 23. The Book of Army Management says:
LINE 1308: [It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give
LINE 1309: us any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch'en calls it "an ancient
LINE 1310: military classic," and Wang Hsi, "an old book on war." Considering the
LINE 1311: enormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun
LINE 1312: Tzŭ's time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China, it
LINE 1313: is not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should
LINE 1314: have been made and written down at some earlier period.]
LINE 1315: On the field of battle,
LINE 1316: [Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]
LINE 1317: the spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of
LINE 1318: gongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence
LINE 1319: the institution of banners and flags.
LINE 1320: 24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and
LINE 1321: eyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.
LINE 1322: [Chang Yu says: "If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the
LINE 1323: same object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be
LINE 1324: like those of a single man."!]
LINE 1325: 25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either
LINE 1326: for the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.
LINE 1327: [Chuang Yu quotes a saying: "Equally guilty are those who advance
LINE 1328: against orders and those who retreat against orders." Tu Mu tells a
LINE 1329: story in this connection of Wu Ch'i, when he was fighting against the
LINE 1330: Ch'in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of
LINE 1331: matchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the
LINE 1332: enemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch'i had the man instantly executed,
LINE 1333: whereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: "This man was a
LINE 1334: good soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded." Wu Ch'i replied: "I
LINE 1335: fully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he
LINE 1336: acted without orders."]
LINE 1337: This is the art of handling large masses of men.
LINE 1338: 26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums,
LINE 1339: and in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing
LINE 1340: the ears and eyes of your army.
LINE 1341: [Ch'en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi's night ride to Ho-yang at the head
LINE 1342: of 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with torches,
LINE 1343: that though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a large army, he did not
LINE 1344: dare to dispute their passage.]
LINE 1345: 27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;
LINE 1346: ["In war," says Chang Yu, "if a spirit of anger can be made to pervade
LINE 1347: all ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset will be
LINE 1348: irresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy's soldiers will be keenest
LINE 1349: when they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is therefore our cue
LINE 1350: not to fight at once, but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have
LINE 1351: worn off, and then strike. It is in this way that they may be robbed of
LINE 1352: their keen spirit." Li Ch'uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found
LINE 1353: in the _Tso Chuan_, year 10, § 1) of Ts'ao Kuei, a protege of Duke
LINE 1354: Chuang of Lu. The latter State was attacked by Ch'i, and the duke was
LINE 1355: about to join battle at Ch'ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy's
LINE 1356: drums, when Ts'ao said: "Not just yet." Only after their drums had
LINE 1357: beaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they
LINE 1358: fought, and the men of Ch'i were utterly defeated. Questioned
LINE 1359: afterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts'ao Kuei
LINE 1360: replied: "In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first
LINE 1361: roll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is
LINE 1362: already on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I
LINE 1363: attacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence
LINE 1364: our victory." Wu Tzŭ (chap. 4) puts "spirit" first among the "four
LINE 1365: important influences" in war, and continues: "The value of a whole
LINE 1366: army—a mighty host of a million men—is dependent on one man alone: such
LINE 1367: is the influence of spirit!"]
LINE 1368: a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.
LINE 1369: [Chang Yu says: "Presence of mind is the general's most important
LINE 1370: asset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and
LINE 1371: to inspire courage into the panic-stricken." The great general Li Ching
LINE 1372: (A.D. 571-649) has a saying: "Attacking does not merely consist in
LINE 1373: assaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array; it
LINE 1374: must include the art of assailing the enemy's mental equilibrium."]
LINE 1375: 28. Now a soldier's spirit is keenest in the morning;
LINE 1376: [Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast. At the battle
LINE 1377: of the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting,
LINE 1378: whereas Hannibal's men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI,
LINE 1379: liv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.]
LINE 1380: by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent
LINE 1381: only on returning to camp.
LINE 1382: 29. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is
LINE 1383: keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This
LINE 1384: is the art of studying moods.
LINE 1385: 30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and
LINE 1386: hubbub amongst the enemy:—this is the art of retaining self-possession.
LINE 1387: 31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait
LINE 1388: at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while
LINE 1389: the enemy is famished:—this is the art of husbanding one's strength.
LINE 1390: 32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect
LINE 1391: order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident
LINE 1392: array:—this is the art of studying circumstances.
LINE 1393: 33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor
LINE 1394: to oppose him when he comes downhill.
LINE 1395: 34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers
LINE 1396: whose temper is keen.
LINE 1397: 35. Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.
LINE 1398: [Li Ch'uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor,
LINE 1399: take these words quite literally of food and drink that have been
LINE 1400: poisoned by the enemy. Ch'en Hao and Chang Yu carefully point out that
LINE 1401: the saying has a wider application.]
LINE 1402: Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.
LINE 1403: [The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by
LINE 1404: saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to
LINE 1405: the death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too
LINE 1406: dangerous an opponent to be tackled. Chang Yu quotes the words of Han
LINE 1407: Hsin: "Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth
LINE 1408: homewards." A marvelous tale is told of Ts'ao Ts'ao's courage and
LINE 1409: resource in ch. 1 of the _San Kuo Chi_, In 198 A.D., he was besieging
LINE 1410: Chang Hsiu in Jang, when Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to
LINE 1411: cutting off Ts'ao's retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off his
LINE 1412: troops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were
LINE 1413: guarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself.
LINE 1414: In this desperate plight Ts'ao waited until nightfall, when he bored a
LINE 1415: tunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it. As soon as the
LINE 1416: whole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on his rear, while
LINE 1417: Ts'ao himself turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were
LINE 1418: thrown into confusion and annihilated. Ts'ao Ts'ao said afterwards:
LINE 1419: "The brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to
LINE 1420: battle in a desperate position: hence I knew how to overcome them."]
LINE 1421: 36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.
LINE 1422: [This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The
LINE 1423: object, as Tu Mu puts it, is "to make him believe that there is a road
LINE 1424: to safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair."
LINE 1425: Tu Mu adds pleasantly: "After that, you may crush him."]
LINE 1426: Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
LINE 1427: [Ch'en Hao quotes the saying: "Birds and beasts when brought to bay
LINE 1428: will use their claws and teeth." Chang Yu says: "If your adversary has
LINE 1429: burned his boats and destroyed his cooking-pots, and is ready to stake
LINE 1430: all on the issue of a battle, he must not be pushed to extremities." Ho
LINE 1431: Shih illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of
LINE 1432: Yen-ch'ing. That general, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was
LINE 1433: surrounded by a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D.
LINE 1434: The country was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force was
LINE 1435: soon in dire straits for want of water. The wells they bored ran dry,
LINE 1436: and the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the
LINE 1437: moisture. Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch'ing
LINE 1438: exclaimed: "We are desperate men. Far better to die for our country
LINE 1439: than to go with fettered hands into captivity!" A strong gale happened
LINE 1440: to be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense
LINE 1441: clouds of sandy dust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had
LINE 1442: abated before deciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer,
LINE 1443: Li Shou-cheng by name, was quicker to see an opportunity, and said:
LINE 1444: "They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm our
LINE 1445: numbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the strenuous
LINE 1446: fighter, and the wind will be our best ally." Accordingly, Fu
LINE 1447: Yen-ch'ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his
LINE 1448: cavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to
LINE 1449: safety.]
LINE 1450: 37. Such is the art of warfare.
LINE 1451: [1] See Col. Henderson, op. cit. vol. I. p. 426.
LINE 1452: [2] For a number of maxims on this head, see "Marshal Turenne"
LINE 1453: (Longmans, 1907), p. 29.
LINE 1454: Chapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS
LINE 1455: [The heading means literally "The Nine Variations," but as Sun Tzŭ does
LINE 1456: not appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already told us
LINE 1457: (V §§ 6-11) that such deflections from the ordinary course are
LINE 1458: practically innumerable, we have little option but to follow Wang Hsi,
LINE 1459: who says that "Nine" stands for an indefinitely large number. "All it
LINE 1460: means is that in warfare we ought to vary our tactics to the utmost
LINE 1461: degree…. I do not know what Ts'ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out
LINE 1462: to be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine
LINE 1463: Situations" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu. The
LINE 1464: only other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost—a
LINE 1465: supposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some
LINE 1466: weight.]
LINE 1467: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the
LINE 1468: sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.
LINE 1469: [Repeated from VII. § 1, where it is certainly more in place. It may
LINE 1470: have been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to
LINE 1471: the chapter.]
LINE 1472: 2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high
LINE 1473: roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in
LINE 1474: dangerously isolated positions.
LINE 1475: [The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the
LINE 1476: beginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on (ibid. § 43. q.v.). Chang Yu
LINE 1477: defines this situation as being situated across the frontier, in
LINE 1478: hostile territory. Li Ch'uan says it is "country in which there are no
LINE 1479: springs or wells, flocks or herds, vegetables or firewood;" Chia Lin,
LINE 1480: "one of gorges, chasms and precipices, without a road by which to
LINE 1481: advance."]
LINE 1482: In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate
LINE 1483: position, you must fight.
LINE 1484: 3. There are roads which must not be followed,
LINE 1485: ["Especially those leading through narrow defiles," says Li Ch'uan,
LINE 1486: "where an ambush is to be feared."]
LINE 1487: armies which must be not attacked,
LINE 1488: [More correctly, perhaps, "there are times when an army must not be
LINE 1489: attacked." Ch'en Hao says: "When you see your way to obtain a rival
LINE 1490: advantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat, refrain from
LINE 1491: attacking, for fear of overtaxing your men's strength."]
LINE 1492: towns which must not be besieged,
LINE 1493: [Cf. III. § 4 Ts'ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own
LINE 1494: experience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the
LINE 1495: city of Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the
LINE 1496: heart of the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the
LINE 1497: subsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities.
LINE 1498: Chang Yu says: "No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be
LINE 1499: held, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble." Hsun Ying, when
LINE 1500: urged to attack Pi-yang, replied: "The city is small and
LINE 1501: well-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat
LINE 1502: of arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock." In
LINE 1503: the seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of war.
LINE 1504: It was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches,
LINE 1505: countermarches and manœuvers. He said: "It is a great mistake to waste
LINE 1506: men in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a
LINE 1507: province." [1] ]
LINE 1508: positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which
LINE 1509: must not be obeyed.
LINE 1510: [This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for
LINE 1511: authority, and Wei Liao Tzŭ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:
LINE 1512: "Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a
LINE 1513: military commander is the negation of civil order!" The unpalatable
LINE 1514: fact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated
LINE 1515: to military necessity.]
LINE 1516: 4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany
LINE 1517: variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.
LINE 1518: 5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted
LINE 1519: with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn
LINE 1520: his knowledge to practical account.
LINE 1521: [Literally, "get the advantage of the ground," which means not only
LINE 1522: securing good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in
LINE 1523: every possible way. Chang Yu says: "Every kind of ground is
LINE 1524: characterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a
LINE 1525: certain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural
LINE 1526: features to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by
LINE 1527: versatility of mind?"]
LINE 1528: 6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying
LINE 1529: his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will
LINE 1530: fail to make the best use of his men.
LINE 1531: [Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally
LINE 1532: advantageous lines of action, namely: "if a certain road is short, it
LINE 1533: must be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a
LINE 1534: town is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can
LINE 1535: be stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military
LINE 1536: operations, the ruler's commands must be obeyed." But there are
LINE 1537: circumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages.
LINE 1538: For instance, "a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if
LINE 1539: he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has
LINE 1540: laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may
LINE 1541: be open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely
LINE 1542: to fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking," and so on.]
LINE 1543: 7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of
LINE 1544: disadvantage will be blended together.
LINE 1545: ["Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one," says
LINE 1546: Ts'ao Kung, "the opposite state should be always present to your
LINE 1547: mind."]
LINE 1548: 8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may
LINE 1549: succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.
LINE 1550: [Tu Mu says: "If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must
LINE 1551: not fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the
LINE 1552: enemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into
LINE 1553: our calculations."]
LINE 1554: 9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always
LINE 1555: ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from
LINE 1556: misfortune.
LINE 1557: [Tu Mu says: "If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position,
LINE 1558: I must consider not only the enemy's ability to injure me, but also my
LINE 1559: own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels
LINE 1560: these two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in
LINE 1561: liberating myself…. For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and
LINE 1562: only think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will
LINE 1563: incite my adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to
LINE 1564: encourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the
LINE 1565: advantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy's toils." See the
LINE 1566: story of Ts'ao Ts'ao, VII. § 35, note.]
LINE 1567: 10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;
LINE 1568: [Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of
LINE 1569: which would only occur to the Oriental mind:—"Entice away the enemy's
LINE 1570: best and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors.
LINE 1571: Introduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be
LINE 1572: rendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension
LINE 1573: between the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful
LINE 1574: contrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his
LINE 1575: treasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into
LINE 1576: excess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely
LINE 1577: women." Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of
LINE 1578: Sun Tzŭ here: "Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer
LINE 1579: injury, and he will submit of his own accord."]
LINE 1580: and make trouble for them,
LINE 1581: [Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble
LINE 1582: should be made for the enemy affecting their "possessions," or, as we
LINE 1583: might say, "assets," which he considers to be "a large army, a rich
LINE 1584: exchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of
LINE 1585: commands." These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.]
LINE 1586: and keep them constantly engaged;
LINE 1587: [Literally, "make servants of them." Tu Yu says "prevent them from
LINE 1588: having any rest."]
LINE 1589: hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.
LINE 1590: [Meng Shih's note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use
LINE 1591: of: "cause them to forget _pien_ (the reasons for acting otherwise than
LINE 1592: on their first impulse), and hasten in our direction."]
LINE 1593: 11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the
LINE 1594: enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the
LINE 1595: chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made
LINE 1596: our position unassailable.
LINE 1597: 12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)
LINE 1598: Recklessness, which leads to destruction;
LINE 1599: ["Bravery without forethought," as Ts'ao Kung analyzes it, which causes
LINE 1600: a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an
LINE 1601: opponent, says Chang Yu, "must not be encountered with brute force, but
LINE 1602: may be lured into an ambush and slain." Cf. Wu Tzŭ, chap. IV. ad init.:
LINE 1603: "In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay
LINE 1604: exclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one
LINE 1605: out of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave
LINE 1606: man is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without
LINE 1607: any perception of what is expedient, must be condemned." Ssu-ma Fa,
LINE 1608: too, makes the incisive remark: "Simply going to one's death does not
LINE 1609: bring about victory."]
LINE 1610: (2) cowardice, which leads to capture;
LINE 1611: [Ts'ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as "cowardice" as
LINE 1612: being of the man "whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an
LINE 1613: advantage," and Wang Hsi adds "who is quick to flee at the sight of
LINE 1614: danger." Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase "he who is bent on
LINE 1615: returning alive," this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as
LINE 1616: Sun Tzŭ knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing
LINE 1617: to take risks. T'ai Kung said: "He who lets an advantage slip will
LINE 1618: subsequently bring upon himself real disaster." In 404 A.D., Liu Yu
LINE 1619: pursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle
LINE 1620: with him at the island of Ch'eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a
LINE 1621: few thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan
LINE 1622: Hsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be
LINE 1623: overcome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so
LINE 1624: that he might escape, if necessary, at a moment's notice. The natural
LINE 1625: result was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly
LINE 1626: quenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with
LINE 1627: fireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray,
LINE 1628: Huan Hsuan's forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled
LINE 1629: for two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat
LINE 1630: similar story of Chao Ying-ch'i, a general of the Chin State who during
LINE 1631: a battle with the army of Ch'u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness
LINE 1632: for him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get
LINE 1633: across.]
LINE 1634: (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;
LINE 1635: [Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,
LINE 1636: Teng Ch'iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to
LINE 1637: fight. Teng Ch'iang said: "Our adversary is of a choleric temper and
LINE 1638: easily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls,
LINE 1639: then he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to
LINE 1640: battle, it is doomed to be our prey." This plan was acted upon, Yao
LINE 1641: Hsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy's
LINE 1642: pretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.]
LINE 1643: (4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;
LINE 1644: This need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect
LINE 1645: in a general. What Sun Tzŭ condemns is rather an exaggerated
LINE 1646: sensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung
LINE 1647: by opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch'en truly observes, though
LINE 1648: somewhat paradoxically: "The seeker after glory should be careless of
LINE 1649: public opinion."]
LINE 1650: (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and
LINE 1651: trouble.
LINE 1652: [Here again, Sun Tzŭ does not mean that the general is to be careless
LINE 1653: of the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger
LINE 1654: of sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate
LINE 1655: comfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long
LINE 1656: run the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the
LINE 1657: prolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken
LINE 1658: feeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered
LINE 1659: city, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his
LINE 1660: military instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated
LINE 1661: efforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many
LINE 1662: strategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end,
LINE 1663: relief came through the very man who started out with the distinct
LINE 1664: resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to
LINE 1665: sentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who
LINE 1666: failed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to
LINE 1667: defend him to me on the ground that he was always "so good to his men."
LINE 1668: By this plea, had he but known it, he was only condemning him out of
LINE 1669: Sun Tzŭ's mouth.]
LINE 1670: 13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the
LINE 1671: conduct of war.
LINE 1672: 14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will
LINE 1673: surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a
LINE 1674: subject of meditation.
