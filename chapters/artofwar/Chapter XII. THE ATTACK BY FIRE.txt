LINE 1: [Rather more than half the chapter (§§ 1-13) is devoted to the subject
LINE 2: of fire, after which the author branches off into other topics.]
LINE 3: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first
LINE 4: is to burn soldiers in their camp;
LINE 5: [So Tu Mu. Li Ch'uan says: "Set fire to the camp, and kill the
LINE 6: soldiers" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch'ao, sent on
LINE 7: a diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. § 51, note],
LINE 8: found himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an
LINE 9: envoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In
LINE 10: consultation with his officers, he exclaimed: "Never venture, never
LINE 11: win! [1] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire
LINE 12: on the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to
LINE 13: discern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate
LINE 14: them completely; this will cool the King's courage and cover us with
LINE 15: glory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.' The officers all
LINE 16: replied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the
LINE 17: Intendant. Pan Ch'ao then fell into a passion: 'It is today,' he cried,
LINE 18: 'that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum
LINE 19: civilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and
LINE 20: everything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy
LINE 21: fate for valiant warriors.' All then agreed to do as he wished.
LINE 22: Accordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly
LINE 23: made their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the
LINE 24: time. Pan Ch'ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind
LINE 25: the enemy's barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot
LINE 26: up, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The
LINE 27: rest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade
LINE 28: at the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the
LINE 29: windward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose
LINE 30: on the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in
LINE 31: frantic disorder. Pan Ch'ao slew three of them with his own hand, while
LINE 32: his companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite.
LINE 33: The remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On
LINE 34: the following day, Pan Ch'ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted
LINE 35: hand: 'Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,
LINE 36: Sir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.' This satisfied Kuo Hsun,
LINE 37: and Pan Ch'ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the
LINE 38: head of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and
LINE 39: trembling, which Pan Ch'ao took steps to allay by issuing a public
LINE 40: proclamation. Then, taking the king's sons as hostage, he returned to
LINE 41: make his report to Tou Ku." _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]
LINE 42: the second is to burn stores;
LINE 43: [Tu Mu says: "Provisions, fuel and fodder." In order to subdue the
LINE 44: rebellious population of Kiangnan, Kao Keng recommended Wen Ti of the
LINE 45: Sui dynasty to make periodical raids and burn their stores of grain, a
LINE 46: policy which in the long run proved entirely successful.]
LINE 47: the third is to burn baggage-trains;
LINE 48: [An example given is the destruction of Yuan Shao's wagons and
LINE 49: impedimenta by Ts'ao Ts'ao in 200 A.D.]
LINE 50: the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;
LINE 51: [Tu Mu says that the things contained in "arsenals" and "magazines" are
LINE 52: the same. He specifies weapons and other implements, bullion and
LINE 53: clothing. Cf. VII. § 11.]
LINE 54: the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.
LINE 55: [Tu Yu says in the _T'ung Tien:_ "To drop fire into the enemy's camp.
LINE 56: The method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows
LINE 57: alight by dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from
LINE 58: powerful crossbows into the enemy's lines."]
LINE 59: 2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.
LINE 60: [T'sao Kung thinks that "traitors in the enemy's camp" are referred to.
LINE 61: But Ch'en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: "We must have
LINE 62: favourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us."
LINE 63: Chia Lin says: "We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather."]
LINE 64: the material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.
LINE 65: [Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: "dry vegetable matter,
LINE 66: reeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc." Here we have the material
LINE 67: cause. Chang Yu says: "vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting
LINE 68: fires."]
LINE 69: 3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special
LINE 70: days for starting a conflagration.
LINE 71: 4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days
LINE 72: are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the
LINE 73: Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar;
LINE 74: [These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the
LINE 75: Twenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius,
LINE 76: Pegasus, Crater and Corvus.]
LINE 77: for these four are all days of rising wind.
LINE 78: 5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible
LINE 79: developments:
LINE 80: 6. (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy's camp, respond at once
LINE 81: with an attack from without.
LINE 82: 7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain
LINE 83: quiet, bide your time and do not attack.
LINE 84: [The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into
LINE 85: confusion. If this effect is not produced, it means that the enemy is
LINE 86: ready to receive us. Hence the necessity for caution.]
LINE 87: 8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it
LINE 88: up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.
LINE 89: [Ts'ao Kung says: "If you see a possible way, advance; but if you find
LINE 90: the difficulties too great, retire."]
LINE 91: 9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do
LINE 92: not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a
LINE 93: favourable moment.
LINE 94: [Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire
LINE 95: breaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the agency of
LINE 96: incendiaries) inside the enemy's camp. "But," he continues, "if the
LINE 97: enemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass, or
LINE 98: if he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out, we
LINE 99: must carry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not
LINE 100: await on in hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our
LINE 101: opponents should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and
LINE 102: thus render our own attempts fruitless." The famous Li Ling once
LINE 103: baffled the leader of the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter, taking
LINE 104: advantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese
LINE 105: general's camp, but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in
LINE 106: the neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On the other hand,
LINE 107: Po-ts'ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in
LINE 108: 184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple precaution. "At the head of
LINE 109: a large army he was besieging Ch'ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu
LINE 110: Sung. The garrison was very small, and a general feeling of nervousness
LINE 111: pervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and
LINE 112: said: "In war, there are various indirect methods of attack, and
LINE 113: numbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here quotes Sun
LINE 114: Tzŭ, V. §§ 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched their camp in the
LINE 115: midst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows. If we
LINE 116: set fire to it at night, they will be thrown into a panic, and we can
LINE 117: make a sortie and attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the
LINE 118: achievement of T'ien Tan.' [See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong
LINE 119: breeze sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind
LINE 120: reeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after
LINE 121: which he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way
LINE 122: through the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells.
LINE 123: Simultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and
LINE 124: Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the
LINE 125: rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight." [_Hou Han Shu_,
LINE 126: ch. 71.]
LINE 127: ]
LINE 128: ]
LINE 129: ]
LINE 130: ]
LINE 131: ]
LINE 132: 10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from
LINE 133: the leeward.
LINE 134: [Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: "When you make a fire, the enemy will
LINE 135: retreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he
LINE 136: will fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success." A
LINE 137: rather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: "If the wind is in
LINE 138: the east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the
LINE 139: attack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side,
LINE 140: and then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your
LINE 141: enemy."]
LINE 142: 11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze
LINE 143: soon falls.
LINE 144: [Cf. Lao Tzŭ's saying: "A violent wind does not last the space of a
LINE 145: morning." (_Tao Te Ching_, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch'en and Wang Hsi say:
LINE 146: "A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak.
LINE 147: This is what happens as a general rule." The phenomenon observed may be
LINE 148: correct enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]
LINE 149: 12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be
LINE 150: known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the
LINE 151: proper days.
LINE 152: [Tu Mu says: "We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,
LINE 153: and watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our
LINE 154: attack with fire." Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently:
LINE 155: "We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also
LINE 156: be on our guard against similar attacks from them."]
LINE 157: 13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;
LINE 158: those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of
LINE 159: strength.
LINE 160: 14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of
LINE 161: all his belongings.
LINE 162: [Ts'ao Kung's note is: "We can merely obstruct the enemy's road or
LINE 163: divide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores." Water
LINE 164: can do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of
LINE 165: fire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is
LINE 166: dismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is
LINE 167: discussed in detail. Wu Tzŭ (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements:
LINE 168: "If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the
LINE 169: water cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be
LINE 170: submerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands
LINE 171: thickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent
LINE 172: gales, it may be exterminated by fire."]
LINE 173: 15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed
LINE 174: in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the
LINE 175: result is waste of time and general stagnation.
LINE 176: [This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzŭ. Ts'ao Kung
LINE 177: says: "Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day."
LINE 178: And Tu Mu: "If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the
LINE 179: deserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and
LINE 180: disaster will ensue." For several reasons, however, and in spite of the
LINE 181: formidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the
LINE 182: interpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch'en alone, whose words I will
LINE 183: quote: "Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and
LINE 184: assaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink
LINE 185: on occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to
LINE 186: such means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not
LINE 187: do, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the
LINE 188: advantages they have got."]
LINE 189: 16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;
LINE 190: the good general cultivates his resources.
LINE 191: [Tu Mu quotes the following from the _San Lueh_, ch. 2: "The warlike
LINE 192: prince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by
LINE 193: good faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays,
LINE 194: there will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not
LINE 195: be respected."]
LINE 196: 17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless
LINE 197: there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is
LINE 198: critical.
LINE 199: [Sun Tzŭ may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so
LINE 200: far in that direction as the remarkable passage in the _Tao Te Ching_,
LINE 201: ch. 69. "I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the
LINE 202: defensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot."]
LINE 203: 18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own
LINE 204: spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.
LINE 205: 19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where
LINE 206: you are.
LINE 207: [This is repeated from XI. § 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an
LINE 208: interpolation, for it is evident that § 20 ought to follow immediately
LINE 209: on § 18.]
LINE 210: 20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by
LINE 211: content.
LINE 212: 21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again
LINE 213: into being;
LINE 214: [The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.]
LINE 215: nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.
LINE 216: 22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full
LINE 217: of caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army
LINE 218: intact.
LINE 219: [1] "Unless you enter the tiger's lair, you cannot get hold of the
LINE 220: tiger's cubs."
