LINE 1: [The contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in § 1
LINE 2: than by this heading.]
LINE 3: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and
LINE 4: observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in
LINE 5: the neighbourhood of valleys.
LINE 6: [The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands, but to keep close to
LINE 7: supplies of water and grass. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 3: "Abide not in natural
LINE 8: ovens," i.e. "the openings of valleys." Chang Yu tells the following
LINE 9: anecdote: Wu-tu Ch'iang was a robber captain in the time of the Later
LINE 10: Han, and Ma Yuan was sent to exterminate his gang. Ch'iang having found
LINE 11: a refuge in the hills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but
LINE 12: seized all the favourable positions commanding supplies of water and
LINE 13: forage. Ch'iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of
LINE 14: provisions that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not
LINE 15: know the advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys."]
LINE 16: 2. Camp in high places,
LINE 17: [Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the
LINE 18: surrounding country.]
LINE 19: facing the sun.
LINE 20: [Tu Mu takes this to mean "facing south," and Ch'en Hao "facing east."
LINE 21: Cf. infra, §§ 11, 13.
LINE 22: Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.
LINE 23: 3. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.
LINE 24: ["In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you," according to Ts'ao
LINE 25: Kung, and also, says Chang Yu, "in order not to be impeded in your
LINE 26: evolutions." The _T'ung Tien_ reads, "If _the enemy_ crosses a river,"
LINE 27: etc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an
LINE 28: interpolation.]
LINE 29: 4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not
LINE 30: advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army
LINE 31: get across, and then deliver your attack.
LINE 32: [Li Ch'uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu
LINE 33: at the Wei River. Turning to the _Ch'ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, fol. 6
LINE 34: verso, we find the battle described as follows: "The two armies were
LINE 35: drawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered
LINE 36: his men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct
LINE 37: a dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung
LINE 38: Chu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he
LINE 39: hastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this
LINE 40: unlooked-for success, and exclaiming: "I felt sure that Han Hsin was
LINE 41: really a coward!" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his
LINE 42: turn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus
LINE 43: releasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the
LINE 44: greater portion of Lung Chu's army from getting across. He then turned
LINE 45: upon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu
LINE 46: himself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further
LINE 47: bank, also scattered and fled in all directions.]
LINE 48: 5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader
LINE 49: near a river which he has to cross.
LINE 50: [For fear of preventing his crossing.]
LINE 51: 6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.
LINE 52: [See _supra_, § 2. The repetition of these words in connection with
LINE 53: water is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: "Said either of troops
LINE 54: marshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself;
LINE 55: in either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing
LINE 56: the sun." The other commentators are not at all explicit.]
LINE 57: Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy.
LINE 58: [Tu Mu says: "As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on
LINE 59: the lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the
LINE 60: sluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that
LINE 61: 'in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,' which is as
LINE 62: much as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the
LINE 63: enemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and
LINE 64: make short work of us." There is also the danger, noted by other
LINE 65: commentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be
LINE 66: carried down to us.]
LINE 67: So much for river warfare.
LINE 68: 7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over
LINE 69: them quickly, without any delay.
LINE 70: [Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the herbage,
LINE 71: and last but not least, because they are low, flat, and exposed to
LINE 72: attack.]
LINE 73: 8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass
LINE 74: near you, and get your back to a clump of trees.
LINE 75: [Li Ch'uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous
LINE 76: where there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they will serve to protect
LINE 77: the rear.]
LINE 78: So much for operations in salt-marshes.
LINE 79: 9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with
LINE 80: rising ground to your right and on your rear,
LINE 81: [Tu Mu quotes T'ai Kung as saying: "An army should have a stream or a
LINE 82: marsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its right."]
LINE 83: so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for
LINE 84: campaigning in flat country.
LINE 85: 10. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge
LINE 86: [Those, namely, concerned with (1) mountains, (2) rivers, (3) marshes,
LINE 87: and (4) plains. Compare Napoleon's "Military Maxims," no. 1.]
LINE 88: which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.
LINE 89: [Regarding the "Yellow Emperor": Mei Yao-ch'en asks, with some
LINE 90: plausibility, whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known
LINE 91: of Huang Ti having conquered four other Emperors. The _Shih Chi_ (ch. 1
LINE 92: ad init.) speaks only of his victories over Yen Ti and Ch'ih Yu. In the
LINE 93: _Liu T'ao_ it is mentioned that he "fought seventy battles and pacified
LINE 94: the Empire." Ts'ao Kung's explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor was
LINE 95: the first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes, each of
LINE 96: whom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of Emperor. Li
LINE 97: Ch'uan tells us that the art of war originated under Huang Ti, who
LINE 98: received it from his Minister Feng Hou.]
LINE 99: 11. All armies prefer high ground to low,
LINE 100: ["High Ground," says Mei Yao-ch'en, "is not only more agreeable and
LINE 101: salubrious, but more convenient from a military point of view; low
LINE 102: ground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disadvantageous for
LINE 103: fighting."]
LINE 104: and sunny places to dark.
LINE 105: 12. If you are careful of your men,
LINE 106: [Ts'ao Kung says: "Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can turn
LINE 107: out your animals to graze."]
LINE 108: and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every
LINE 109: kind,
LINE 110: [Chang Yu says: "The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak
LINE 111: of illness."]
LINE 112: and this will spell victory.
LINE 113: 13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the
LINE 114: slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of
LINE 115: your soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground.
LINE 116: 14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you
LINE 117: wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it
LINE 118: subsides.
LINE 119: 15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running
LINE 120: between, deep natural hollows,
LINE 121: The latter defined as "places enclosed on every side by steep banks,
LINE 122: with pools of water at the bottom."]
LINE 123: confined places,
LINE 124: [Defined as "natural pens or prisons" or "places surrounded by
LINE 125: precipices on three sides—easy to get into, but hard to get out of."]
LINE 126: tangled thickets,
LINE 127: [Defined as "places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears
LINE 128: cannot be used."]
LINE 129: quagmires
LINE 130: [Defined as "low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable
LINE 131: for chariots and horsemen."]
LINE 132: and crevasses,
LINE 133: [Defined by Mei Yao-ch'en as "a narrow difficult way between beetling
LINE 134: cliffs." Tu Mu's note is "ground covered with trees and rocks, and
LINE 135: intersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls." This is very vague, but
LINE 136: Chia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and
LINE 137: Chang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the
LINE 138: commentators certainly inclines to the rendering "defile." But the
LINE 139: ordinary meaning of the Chinese in one place is "a crack or fissure"
LINE 140: and the fact that the meaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence
LINE 141: indicates something in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun
LINE 142: Tzŭ is here speaking of crevasses.]
LINE 143: should be left with all possible speed and not approached.
LINE 144: 16. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to
LINE 145: approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on
LINE 146: his rear.
LINE 147: 17. If in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly
LINE 148: country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with
LINE 149: reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed
LINE 150: out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious
LINE 151: spies are likely to be lurking.
LINE 152: [Chang Yu has the note: "We must also be on our guard against traitors
LINE 153: who may lie in close covert, secretly spying out our weaknesses and
LINE 154: overhearing our instructions."]
LINE 155: 18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on
LINE 156: the natural strength of his position.
LINE 157: [Here begin Sun Tzŭ's remarks on the reading of signs, much of which is
LINE 158: so good that it could almost be included in a modern manual like Gen.
LINE 159: Baden-Powell's "Aids to Scouting."]
LINE 160: 19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious
LINE 161: for the other side to advance.
LINE 162: [Probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes to
LINE 163: dislodge us. "If he came close up to us, says Tu Mu, "and tried to
LINE 164: force a battle, he would seem to despise us, and there would be less
LINE 165: probability of our responding to the challenge."]
LINE 166: 20. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a
LINE 167: bait.
LINE 168: 21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is
LINE 169: advancing.
LINE 170: [Ts'ao Kung explains this as "felling trees to clear a passage," and
LINE 171: Chang Yu says: "Every man sends out scouts to climb high places and
LINE 172: observe the enemy. If a scout sees that the trees of a forest are
LINE 173: moving and shaking, he may know that they are being cut down to clear a
LINE 174: passage for the enemy's march."]
LINE 175: The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means
LINE 176: that the enemy wants to make us suspicious.
LINE 177: [Tu Yu's explanation, borrowed from Ts'ao Kung's, is as follows: "The
LINE 178: presence of a number of screens or sheds in the midst of thick
LINE 179: vegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled and, fearing pursuit,
LINE 180: has constructed these hiding-places in order to make us suspect an
LINE 181: ambush." It appears that these "screens" were hastily knotted together
LINE 182: out of any long grass which the retreating enemy happened to come
LINE 183: across.]
LINE 184: 22. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.
LINE 185: [Chang Yu's explanation is doubtless right: "When birds that are flying
LINE 186: along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means that soldiers
LINE 187: are in ambush at the spot beneath."]
LINE 188: Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.
LINE 189: 23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of
LINE 190: chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area,
LINE 191: it betokens the approach of infantry.
LINE 192: ["High and sharp," or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat
LINE 193: exaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the phenomenon
LINE 194: by saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than men, raise more
LINE 195: dust, and also follow one another in the same wheel-track, whereas
LINE 196: foot-soldiers would be marching in ranks, many abreast. According to
LINE 197: Chang Yu, "every army on the march must have scouts some way in
LINE 198: advance, who on sighting dust raised by the enemy, will gallop back and
LINE 199: report it to the commander-in-chief." Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: "As you
LINE 200: move along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar
LINE 201: for the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting
LINE 202: up, glitter of arms, etc." [1] ]
LINE 203: When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties
LINE 204: have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and
LINE 205: fro signify that the army is encamping.
LINE 206: [Chang Yu says: "In apportioning the defences for a cantonment, light
LINE 207: horse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak
LINE 208: and strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity
LINE 209: of dust and its motion."]
LINE 210: 24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is
LINE 211: about to advance.
LINE 212: ["As though they stood in great fear of us," says Tu Mu. "Their object
LINE 213: is to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack
LINE 214: us." Chang Yu alludes to the story of T'ien Tan of the Ch'i-mo against
LINE 215: the Yen forces, led by Ch'i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the _Shih Chi_ we read:
LINE 216: "T'ien Tan openly said: 'My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off
LINE 217: the noses of their Ch'i prisoners and place them in the front rank to
LINE 218: fight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.' The other
LINE 219: side being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion;
LINE 220: but those within the city were enraged at seeing their
LINE 221: fellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should
LINE 222: fall into the enemy's hands, were nerved to defend themselves more
LINE 223: obstinately than ever. Once again T'ien Tan sent back converted spies
LINE 224: who reported these words to the enemy: "What I dread most is that the
LINE 225: men of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by
LINE 226: inflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become
LINE 227: faint-hearted.' Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and
LINE 228: burned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo,
LINE 229: witnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were
LINE 230: all impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold.
LINE 231: T'ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise.
LINE 232: But instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and
LINE 233: ordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the
LINE 234: ranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served
LINE 235: out all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The
LINE 236: regular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were
LINE 237: manned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys
LINE 238: were dispatched to the enemy's camp to arrange terms of surrender,
LINE 239: whereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T'ien Tan also collected
LINE 240: 20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens
LINE 241: of Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the prayer that, when the
LINE 242: town capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or
LINE 243: their women to be maltreated. Ch'i Chieh, in high good humor, granted
LINE 244: their prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless.
LINE 245: Meanwhile, T'ien Tan got together a thousand oxen, decked them with
LINE 246: pieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored
LINE 247: stripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased
LINE 248: rushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the
LINE 249: rushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had
LINE 250: pierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked
LINE 251: warriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the
LINE 252: enemy's camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for
LINE 253: their tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their
LINE 254: bodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom
LINE 255: they came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up
LINE 256: with gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At
LINE 257: the same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those
LINE 258: that remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums
LINE 259: and hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed
LINE 260: by the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly
LINE 261: pursued by the men of Ch'i, who succeeded in slaying their general Ch'i
LINE 262: Chien…. The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some
LINE 263: seventy cities which had belonged to the Ch'i State."]
LINE 264: Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that
LINE 265: he will retreat.
LINE 266: 25. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on
LINE 267: the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.
LINE 268: 26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.
LINE 269: [The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch'uan indicates "a treaty confirmed
LINE 270: by oaths and hostages." Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand,
LINE 271: simply say "without reason," "on a frivolous pretext."]
LINE 272: 27. When there is much running about
LINE 273: [Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental
LINE 274: banner.]
LINE 275: and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has
LINE 276: come.
LINE 277: 28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.
LINE 278: 29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint
LINE 279: from want of food.
LINE 280: 30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,
LINE 281: the army is suffering from thirst.
LINE 282: [As Tu Mu remarks: "One may know the condition of a whole army from the
LINE 283: behavior of a single man."]
LINE 284: 31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to
LINE 285: secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.
LINE 286: 32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.
LINE 287: [A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch'en Hao says,
LINE 288: the enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]
LINE 289: Clamour by night betokens nervousness.
LINE 290: 33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is
LINE 291: weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If
LINE 292: the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.
LINE 293: [Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: "If all the officers of an
LINE 294: army are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with
LINE 295: fatigue" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.]
LINE 296: 34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for
LINE 297: food,
LINE 298: [In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and
LINE 299: the horses chiefly on grass.]
LINE 300: and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,
LINE 301: showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that
LINE 302: they are determined to fight to the death.
LINE 303: [I may quote here the illustrative passage from the _Hou Han Shu_, ch.
LINE 304: 71, given in abbreviated form by the _P'ei Wen Yun Fu:_ "The rebel Wang
LINE 305: Kuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch'en- ts'ang, and Huang-fu
LINE 306: Sung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against
LINE 307: him. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear
LINE 308: to his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to
LINE 309: throw down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to
LINE 310: the attack, but Cho said: 'It is a principle of war not to pursue
LINE 311: desperate men and not to press a retreating host.' Sung answered: 'That
LINE 312: does not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a
LINE 313: retreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized
LINE 314: multitude, not a band of desperate men.' Thereupon he advances to the
LINE 315: attack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo
LINE 316: being slain."]
LINE 317: 35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in
LINE 318: subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.
LINE 319: 36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his
LINE 320: resources;
LINE 321: [Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always
LINE 322: a fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good
LINE 323: temper.]
LINE 324: too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.
LINE 325: [Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity
LINE 326: is necessary to keep the men to their duty.]
LINE 327: 37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's
LINE 328: numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.
LINE 329: [I follow the interpretation of Ts'ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch'uan,
LINE 330: Tu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia
LINE 331: Lin, Mei Tao-ch'en and Wang Hsi, is: "The general who is first
LINE 332: tyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny,
LINE 333: etc." This would connect the sentence with what went before about
LINE 334: rewards and punishments.]
LINE 335: 38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign
LINE 336: that the enemy wishes for a truce.
LINE 337: [Tu Mu says: "If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages,
LINE 338: it is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because
LINE 339: their strength is exhausted or for some other reason." But it hardly
LINE 340: needs a Sun Tzŭ to draw such an obvious inference.]
LINE 341: 39. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a
LINE 342: long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,
LINE 343: the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.
LINE 344: [Ts'ao Kung says a manœuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain
LINE 345: time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.]
LINE 346: 40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply
LINE 347: sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.
LINE 348: [Literally, "no martial advance." That is to say, _cheng_ tactics and
LINE 349: frontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.]
LINE 350: What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,
LINE 351: keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.
LINE 352: [This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in
LINE 353: squeezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch'uan, who appears to
LINE 354: offer the simplest explanation: "Only the side that gets more men will
LINE 355: win." Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in
LINE 356: language which is lucidity itself: "When the numbers are even, and no
LINE 357: favourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough
LINE 358: to deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst
LINE 359: our sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and
LINE 360: keeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But
LINE 361: we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us." He then quotes
LINE 362: from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 3: "The nominal strength of mercenary troops may
LINE 363: be 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that
LINE 364: figure."]
LINE 365: 41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is
LINE 366: sure to be captured by them.
LINE 367: [Ch'en Hao, quoting from the _Tso Chuan_, says: "If bees and scorpions
LINE 368: carry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent,
LINE 369: then, should not be treated with contempt."]
LINE 370: 42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,
LINE 371: they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be
LINE 372: practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,
LINE 373: punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.
LINE 374: 43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with
LINE 375: humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.
LINE 376: [Yen Tzŭ [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: "His civil virtues
LINE 377: endeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in
LINE 378: awe." Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 4 init.: "The ideal commander unites culture with
LINE 379: a warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of
LINE 380: hardness and tenderness."]
LINE 381: This is a certain road to victory.
LINE 382: 44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army
