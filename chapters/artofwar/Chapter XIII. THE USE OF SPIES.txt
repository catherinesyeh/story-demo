LINE 1: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching
LINE 2: them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on
LINE 3: the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a
LINE 4: thousand ounces of silver.
LINE 5: [Cf. II. §§ 1, 13, 14.]
LINE 6: There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down
LINE 7: exhausted on the highways.
LINE 8: [Cf. _Tao Te Ching_, ch. 30: "Where troops have been quartered,
LINE 9: brambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: "We may be
LINE 10: reminded of the saying: 'On serious ground, gather in plunder.' Why
LINE 11: then should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the
LINE 12: highways?—The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of
LINE 13: munitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the
LINE 14: injunction to 'forage on the enemy' only means that when an army is
LINE 15: deeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided
LINE 16: against. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn,
LINE 17: we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of
LINE 18: supplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where
LINE 19: provisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed
LINE 20: with."]
LINE 21: As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their
LINE 22: labor.
LINE 23: [Mei Yao-ch'en says: "Men will be lacking at the plough-tail." The
LINE 24: allusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each
LINE 25: consisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated
LINE 26: on behalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here
LINE 27: also, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well
LINE 28: sunk, to be used by all in common. [See II. § 12, note.] In time of
LINE 29: war, one of the families had to serve in the army, while the other
LINE 30: seven contributed to its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men
LINE 31: (reckoning one able-bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of
LINE 32: 700,000 families would be affected.]
LINE 33: 2. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the
LINE 34: victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in
LINE 35: ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the
LINE 36: outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments,
LINE 37: ["For spies" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect
LINE 38: of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned
LINE 39: at this point.]
LINE 40: is the height of inhumanity.
LINE 41: [Sun Tzŭ's agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to
LINE 42: the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which
LINE 43: war always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of
LINE 44: the enemy's condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a
LINE 45: war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to
LINE 46: employ spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless
LINE 47: they are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false
LINE 48: economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose,
LINE 49: when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum.
LINE 50: This grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun
LINE 51: Tzŭ concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a
LINE 52: crime against humanity.]
LINE 53: 3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his
LINE 54: sovereign, no master of victory.
LINE 55: [This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the
LINE 56: national temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C.,
LINE 57: these memorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch'u State:
LINE 58: "The [Chinese] character for 'prowess' is made up of [the characters
LINE 59: for] 'to stay' and 'a spear' (cessation of hostilities). Military
LINE 60: prowess is seen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of
LINE 61: weapons, the preservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm
LINE 62: establishment of merit, the bestowal of happiness on the people,
LINE 63: putting harmony between the princes, the diffusion of wealth."]
LINE 64: 4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike
LINE 65: and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is
LINE 66: _foreknowledge_.
LINE 67: [That is, knowledge of the enemy's dispositions, and what he means to
LINE 68: do.]
LINE 69: 5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be
LINE 70: obtained inductively from experience,
LINE 71: [Tu Mu's note is: "[knowledge of the enemy] cannot be gained by
LINE 72: reasoning from other analogous cases."]
LINE 73: nor by any deductive calculation.
LINE 74: [Li Ch'uan says: "Quantities like length, breadth, distance and
LINE 75: magnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human
LINE 76: actions cannot be so calculated."]
LINE 77: 6. Knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from
LINE 78: other men.
LINE 79: [Mei Yao-ch'en has rather an interesting note: "Knowledge of the
LINE 80: spirit-world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural
LINE 81: science may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe
LINE 82: can be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an
LINE 83: enemy are ascertainable through spies and spies alone."]
LINE 84: 7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local
LINE 85: spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5)
LINE 86: surviving spies.
LINE 87: 8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the
LINE 88: secret system. This is called "divine manipulation of the threads." It
LINE 89: is the sovereign's most precious faculty.
LINE 90: [Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry
LINE 91: leaders, had officers styled 'scout masters,' whose business it was to
LINE 92: collect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts
LINE 93: and spies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the
LINE 94: previous knowledge of the enemy's moves thus gained." [1] ]
LINE 95: 9. Having _local spies_ means employing the services of the inhabitants
LINE 96: of a district.
LINE 97: [Tu Mu says: "In the enemy's country, win people over by kind
LINE 98: treatment, and use them as spies."]
LINE 99: 10. Having _inward spies_, making use of officials of the enemy.
LINE 100: [Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in
LINE 101: this respect: "Worthy men who have been degraded from office, criminals
LINE 102: who have undergone punishment; also, favourite concubines who are greedy
LINE 103: for gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions, or
LINE 104: who have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others who are
LINE 105: anxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have
LINE 106: a chance of displaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who
LINE 107: always want to have a foot in each boat. Officials of these several
LINE 108: kinds," he continues, "should be secretly approached and bound to one's
LINE 109: interests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able to
LINE 110: find out the state of affairs in the enemy's country, ascertain the
LINE 111: plans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb the
LINE 112: harmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his ministers."
LINE 113: The necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing with "inward
LINE 114: spies," appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: "Lo
LINE 115: Shang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel
LINE 116: Li Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P'i. After each side had
LINE 117: experienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse
LINE 118: to the services of a certain P'o-t'ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to
LINE 119: have him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo
LINE 120: Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from
LINE 121: inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for
LINE 122: making a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march
LINE 123: out all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head
LINE 124: with orders to attack at P'o-t'ai's bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung's
LINE 125: general, Li Hsiang, had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march;
LINE 126: and P'o-t'ai, having reared long scaling-ladders against the city
LINE 127: walls, now lighted the beacon-fire. Wei Po's men raced up on seeing the
LINE 128: signal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while
LINE 129: others were drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred
LINE 130: of Lo Shang's soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom
LINE 131: was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces,
LINE 132: both inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely."
LINE 133: [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story
LINE 134: from. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or that of his
LINE 135: father Li T'e, _Chin Shu_, ch. 120, 121.]
LINE 136: 11. Having _converted spies_, getting hold of the enemy's spies and
LINE 137: using them for our own purposes.
LINE 138: [By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the
LINE 139: enemy's service, and inducing them to carry back false information as
LINE 140: well as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand,
LINE 141: Hsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but
LINE 142: contrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on.
LINE 143: Several of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition;
LINE 144: but that it is not what Sun Tzŭ meant is conclusively proved by his
LINE 145: subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (§ 21
LINE 146: sqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used
LINE 147: with conspicuous success: (1) by T'ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo
LINE 148: (see _supra_, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57);
LINE 149: and by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P'o was conducting a
LINE 150: defensive campaign against Ch'in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved
LINE 151: of Lien P'o's cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to
LINE 152: avert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to
LINE 153: the reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and
LINE 154: were already in Fan Chu's pay. They said: "The only thing which causes
LINE 155: Ch'in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P'o they
LINE 156: consider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long
LINE 157: run." Now this Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his
LINE 158: boyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military
LINE 159: matters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander
LINE 160: in the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much
LINE 161: disquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he
LINE 162: spoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if
LINE 163: ever Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of
LINE 164: Chao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own
LINE 165: mother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed
LINE 166: Lien P'o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po
LINE 167: Ch'i and the great military power of Ch'in. He fell into a trap by
LINE 168: which his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and
LINE 169: after a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished
LINE 170: soldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and
LINE 171: his whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put
LINE 172: to the sword.]
LINE 173: 12. Having _doomed spies_, doing certain things openly for purposes of
LINE 174: deception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them
LINE 175: to the enemy.
LINE 176: [Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: "We ostentatiously do
LINE 177: things calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe
LINE 178: that they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are
LINE 179: captured in the enemy's lines, they will make an entirely false report,
LINE 180: and the enemy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do
LINE 181: something quite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death."
LINE 182: As an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released
LINE 183: by Pan Ch'ao in his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also
LINE 184: refers to T'ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T'ai Tsung to lull
LINE 185: the Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was
LINE 186: able to deliver a crushing blow against him. Chang Yu says that the
LINE 187: Turks revenged themselves by killing T'ang Chien, but this is a
LINE 188: mistake, for we read in both the old and the New T'ang History (ch. 58,
LINE 189: fol. 2 and ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on
LINE 190: until 656. Li I-chi played a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when
LINE 191: sent by the King of Han to open peaceful negotiations with Ch'i. He has
LINE 192: certainly more claim to be described a "doomed spy", for the king of
LINE 193: Ch'i, being subsequently attacked without warning by Han Hsin, and
LINE 194: infuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi, ordered the
LINE 195: unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.]
LINE 196: 13. _Surviving spies_, finally, are those who bring back news from the
LINE 197: enemy's camp.
LINE 198: [This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a
LINE 199: regular part of the army. Tu Mu says: "Your surviving spy must be a man
LINE 200: of keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby
LINE 201: exterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed
LINE 202: with physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts
LINE 203: of dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame
LINE 204: and ignominy." Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta'hsi Wu of the
LINE 205: Sui dynasty: "When he was governor of Eastern Ch'in, Shen-wu of Ch'i
LINE 206: made a hostile movement upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T'ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu]
LINE 207: sent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other
LINE 208: men. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy's uniform. When it
LINE 209: was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy's camp
LINE 210: and stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the
LINE 211: passwords used in the army. Then they got on their horses again and
LINE 212: boldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and
LINE 213: more than once, happening to come across a soldier who was committing
LINE 214: some breach of discipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a
LINE 215: sound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible
LINE 216: information about the enemy's dispositions, and received warm
LINE 217: commendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was
LINE 218: able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary."]
LINE 219: 14. Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate
LINE 220: relations to be maintained than with spies.
LINE 221: [Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch'en point out that the spy is privileged to enter
LINE 222: even the general's private sleeping-tent.]
LINE 223: None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should
LINE 224: greater secrecy be preserved.
LINE 225: [Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be
LINE 226: carried "mouth-to-ear." The following remarks on spies may be quoted
LINE 227: from Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous
LINE 228: commander: "Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays
LINE 229: them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor
LINE 230: should they know one another. When they propose anything very material,
LINE 231: secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and
LINE 232: children as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to
LINE 233: them but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. [2] ]
LINE 234: 15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive
LINE 235: sagacity.
LINE 236: [Mei Yao-ch'en says: "In order to use them, one must know fact from
LINE 237: falsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and
LINE 238: double-dealing." Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more
LINE 239: along the lines of "intuitive perception" and "practical intelligence."
LINE 240: Tu Mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies themselves:
LINE 241: "Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of
LINE 242: character and the extent of their experience and skill." But he
LINE 243: continues: "A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous
LINE 244: than mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such."
LINE 245: So that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the
LINE 246: passage."]
LINE 247: 16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and
LINE 248: straightforwardness.
LINE 249: [Chang Yu says: "When you have attracted them by substantial offers,
LINE 250: you must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for
LINE 251: you with all their might."]
LINE 252: 17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the
LINE 253: truth of their reports.
LINE 254: [Mei Yao-ch'en says: "Be on your guard against the possibility of spies
LINE 255: going over to the service of the enemy."]
LINE 256: 18. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of
LINE 257: business.
LINE 258: [Cf. VI. § 9.]
LINE 259: 19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is
LINE 260: ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret
LINE 261: was told.
LINE 262: [Word for word, the translation here is: "If spy matters are heard
LINE 263: before [our plans] are carried out," etc. Sun Tzŭ's main point in this
LINE 264: passage is: Whereas you kill the spy himself "as a punishment for
LINE 265: letting out the secret," the object of killing the other man is only,
LINE 266: as Ch'en Hao puts it, "to stop his mouth" and prevent news leaking any
LINE 267: further. If it had already been repeated to others, this object would
LINE 268: not be gained. Either way, Sun Tzŭ lays himself open to the charge of
LINE 269: inhumanity, though Tu Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man
LINE 270: deserves to be put to death, for the spy would certainly not have told
LINE 271: the secret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him."]
LINE 272: 20. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to
LINE 273: assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding
LINE 274: out the names of the attendants, the aides-de- camp,
LINE 275: [Literally "visitors", is equivalent, as Tu Yu says, to "those whose
LINE 276: duty it is to keep the general supplied with information," which
LINE 277: naturally necessitates frequent interviews with him.]
LINE 278: the door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must
LINE 279: be commissioned to ascertain these.
LINE 280: [As the first step, no doubt towards finding out if any of these
LINE 281: important functionaries can be won over by bribery.]
LINE 282: 21. The enemy's spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out,
LINE 283: tempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will
LINE 284: become converted spies and available for our service.
LINE 285: 22. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we
LINE 286: are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.
LINE 287: [Tu Yu says: "through conversion of the enemy's spies we learn the
LINE 288: enemy's condition." And Chang Yu says: "We must tempt the converted spy
LINE 289: into our service, because it is he that knows which of the local
LINE 290: inhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the officials are open to
LINE 291: corruption."]
LINE 292: 23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed
LINE 293: spy to carry false tidings to the enemy.
LINE 294: [Chang Yu says, "because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best
LINE 295: be deceived."]
LINE 296: 24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used
LINE 297: on appointed occasions.
LINE 298: 25. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of
LINE 299: the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first
LINE 300: instance, from the converted spy.
LINE 301: [As explained in §§ 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but
LINE 302: makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.]
LINE 303: Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost
LINE 304: liberality.
LINE 305: 26. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty
LINE 306: [Sun Tzŭ means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name was
LINE 307: changed to Yin by P'an Keng in 1401.
LINE 308: was due to I Chih
LINE 309: [Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part
LINE 310: in Ch'eng T'ang's campaign against Chieh Kuei.]
LINE 311: who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty
LINE 312: was due to Lü Ya
LINE 313: [Lu Shang rose to high office under the tyrant Chou Hsin, whom he
LINE 314: afterwards helped to overthrow. Popularly known as T'ai Kung, a title
LINE 315: bestowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on
LINE 316: war, erroneously identified with the _Liu T'ao_.]
LINE 317: who had served under the Yin.
LINE 318: [There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to
LINE 319: introduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are
LINE 320: by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly
LINE 321: doubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious
LINE 322: examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His
LINE 323: suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the
LINE 324: intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these
LINE 325: former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch'en
LINE 326: appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: "I Yin
LINE 327: and Lu Ya," he says, "were not rebels against the Government. Hsia
LINE 328: could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not
LINE 329: employ the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements
LINE 330: were all for the good of the people." Ho Shih is also indignant: "How
LINE 331: should two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common
LINE 332: spies? Sun Tzŭ's mention of them simply means that the proper use of
LINE 333: the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest
LINE 334: mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them
LINE 335: for the task. The above words only emphasize this point." Ho Shih
LINE 336: believes then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their
LINE 337: supposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]
LINE 338: 27. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who
LINE 339: will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying
LINE 340: and thereby they achieve great results.
LINE 341: [Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: "Just as water, which carries a
LINE 342: boat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so
LINE 343: reliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the
LINE 344: cause of utter destruction."]
LINE 345: Spies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an
LINE 346: army's ability to move.
LINE 347: [Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man without ears or
LINE 348: eyes.]
