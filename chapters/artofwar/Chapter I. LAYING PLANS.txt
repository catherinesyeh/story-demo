LINE 1: [Ts'ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of
LINE 2: this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple
LINE 3: selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in
LINE 4: his tent. See. § 26.]
LINE 5: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
LINE 6: 2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
LINE 7: ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
LINE 8: neglected.
LINE 9: 3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be
LINE 10: taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine
LINE 11: the conditions obtaining in the field.
LINE 12: 4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The
LINE 13: Commander; (5) Method and discipline.
LINE 14: [It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by "Moral Law" a
LINE 15: principle of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral
LINE 16: aspect. One might be tempted to render it by "morale," were it not
LINE 17: considered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in § 13.]
LINE 18: 5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with
LINE 19: their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,
LINE 20: undismayed by any danger.
LINE 21: [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "Without constant practice, the
LINE 22: officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;
LINE 23: without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute
LINE 24: when the crisis is at hand."]
LINE 25: 7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
LINE 26: [The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words
LINE 27: here. Meng Shih refers to "the hard and the soft, waxing and waning" of
LINE 28: Heaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is
LINE 29: "the general economy of Heaven," including the five elements, the four
LINE 30: seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]
LINE 31: 8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;
LINE 32: open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.
LINE 33: 9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,
LINE 34: benevolence, courage and strictness.
LINE 35: [The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or
LINE 36: benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,
LINE 37: or "proper feeling;" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here
LINE 38: "wisdom" and "sincerity" are put before "humanity or benevolence," and
LINE 39: the two military virtues of "courage" and "strictness" substituted for
LINE 40: "uprightness of mind" and "self-respect, self-control, or 'proper
LINE 41: feeling.'"]
LINE 42: 10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of
LINE 43: the army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the
LINE 44: officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the
LINE 45: army, and the control of military expenditure.
LINE 46: 11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows
LINE 47: them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.
LINE 48: 12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the
LINE 49: military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in
LINE 50: this wise:—
LINE 51: 13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?
LINE 52: [I.e., "is in harmony with his subjects." Cf. § 5.]
LINE 53: (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?
LINE 54: (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?
LINE 55: [See §§ 7, 8]
LINE 56: (4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
LINE 57: [Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts'ao Ts'ao (A.D. 155-220),
LINE 58: who was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his
LINE 59: own severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned
LINE 60: himself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of
LINE 61: corn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy
LINE 62: his sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts'ao Ts'ao's own comment
LINE 63: on the present passage is characteristically curt: "when you lay down a
LINE 64: law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must
LINE 65: be put to death."]
LINE 66: (5) Which army is the stronger?
LINE 67: [Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch'en puts it, freely
LINE 68: rendered, "_esprit de corps_ and 'big battalions.'"]
LINE 69: (6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?
LINE 70: [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "Without constant practice, the
LINE 71: officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;
LINE 72: without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute
LINE 73: when the crisis is at hand."]
LINE 74: (7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and
LINE 75: punishment?
LINE 76: [On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be
LINE 77: properly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]
LINE 78: 14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or
LINE 79: defeat.
LINE 80: 15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will
LINE 81: conquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that
LINE 82: hearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:—let
LINE 83: such a one be dismissed!
LINE 84: [The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzŭ's treatise was
LINE 85: composed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu
LINE 86: State.]
LINE 87: 16. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any
LINE 88: helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.
LINE 89: 17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one's
LINE 90: plans.
LINE 91: [Sun Tzŭ, as a practical soldier, will have none of the "bookish
LINE 92: theoric." He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract
LINE 93: principles; "for," as Chang Yu puts it, "while the main laws of
LINE 94: strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and
LINE 95: sundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to
LINE 96: secure a favourable position in actual warfare." On the eve of the
LINE 97: battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the
LINE 98: Duke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations
LINE 99: were for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find
LINE 100: himself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a
LINE 101: critical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: "Who will
LINE 102: attack the first tomorrow—I or Bonaparte?" "Bonaparte," replied Lord
LINE 103: Uxbridge. "Well," continued the Duke, "Bonaparte has not given me any
LINE 104: idea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you
LINE 105: expect me to tell you what mine are?" [1] ]
LINE 106: 18. All warfare is based on deception.
LINE 107: [The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every
LINE 108: soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many
LINE 109: military qualities, was especially distinguished by "the extraordinary
LINE 110: skill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend
LINE 111: and foe."]
LINE 112: 19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our
LINE 113: forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy
LINE 114: believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are
LINE 115: near.
LINE 116: 20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
LINE 117: [All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, "When he is in disorder, crush
LINE 118: him." It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzŭ is still illustrating
LINE 119: the uses of deception in war.]
LINE 120: 21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in
LINE 121: superior strength, evade him.
LINE 122: 22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.
LINE 123: Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
LINE 124: [Wang Tzŭ, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his
LINE 125: adversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and
LINE 126: immobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.]
LINE 127: 23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
LINE 128: [This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch'en has the note: "while
LINE 129: we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out." The
LINE 130: _Yu Lan_ has "Lure him on and tire him out."]
LINE 131: If his forces are united, separate them.
LINE 132: [Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the
LINE 133: commentators: "If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division
LINE 134: between them."]
LINE 135: 24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not
LINE 136: expected.
LINE 137: 25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged
LINE 138: beforehand.
LINE 139: 26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his
LINE 140: temple ere the battle is fought.
LINE 141: [Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple
LINE 142: to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the
LINE 143: field, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]
LINE 144: The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.
LINE 145: Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to
LINE 146: defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this
LINE 147: point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
