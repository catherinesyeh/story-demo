LINE 1: [Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:
LINE 2: "Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the
LINE 3: defensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect
LINE 4: methods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of
LINE 5: attack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect
LINE 6: methods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods
LINE 7: before proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use
LINE 8: of direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the
LINE 9: perception of weak and strong points depends again on the above
LINE 10: methods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter
LINE 11: on Energy."]
LINE 12: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of
LINE 13: the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field
LINE 14: and has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.
LINE 15: 2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but
LINE 16: does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.
LINE 17: [One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or
LINE 18: fights not at all. [1] ]
LINE 19: 3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach
LINE 20: of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible
LINE 21: for the enemy to draw near.
LINE 22: [In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he
LINE 23: will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to
LINE 24: defend.]
LINE 25: 4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;
LINE 26: [This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch'en's
LINE 27: interpretation of I. § 23.]
LINE 28: if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,
LINE 29: he can force him to move.
LINE 30: 5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march
LINE 31: swiftly to places where you are not expected.
LINE 32: 6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches
LINE 33: through country where the enemy is not.
LINE 34: [Ts'ao Kung sums up very well: "Emerge from the void [q.d. like "a bolt
LINE 35: from the blue"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are
LINE 36: defended, attack in unexpected quarters."]
LINE 37: 7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack
LINE 38: places which are undefended.
LINE 39: [Wang Hsi explains "undefended places" as "weak points; that is to say,
LINE 40: where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit;
LINE 41: where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict
LINE 42: enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or
LINE 43: the defenders are variance amongst themselves."]
LINE 44: You can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions
LINE 45: that cannot be attacked.
LINE 46: [_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There
LINE 47: is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later
LINE 48: clause. Tu Mu, Ch'en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch'en assume the meaning to be:
LINE 49: "In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those
LINE 50: places that are not likely to be attacked;" and Tu Mu adds: "How much
LINE 51: more, then, those that will be attacked." Taken thus, however, the
LINE 52: clause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in
LINE 53: the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang
LINE 54: Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: "He who is
LINE 55: skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see
LINE 56: IV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This
LINE 57: being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the
LINE 58: enemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most
LINE 59: secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to
LINE 60: estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold
LINE 61: are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack."]
LINE 62: 8. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not
LINE 63: know what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does
LINE 64: not know what to attack.
LINE 65: [An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]
LINE 66: 9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be
LINE 67: invisible, through you inaudible;
LINE 68: [Literally, "without form or sound," but it is said of course with
LINE 69: reference to the enemy.]
LINE 70: and hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.
LINE 71: 10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the
LINE 72: enemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your
LINE 73: movements are more rapid than those of the enemy.
LINE 74: 11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even
LINE 75: though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we
LINE 76: need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
LINE 77: [Tu Mu says: "If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line
LINE 78: of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return;
LINE 79: if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign
LINE 80: himself." It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late
LINE 81: Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]
LINE 82: 12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging
LINE 83: us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the
LINE 84: ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in
LINE 85: his way.
LINE 86: [This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia
LINE 87: Lin: "even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch." Li
LINE 88: Ch'uan says: "we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;" and
LINE 89: Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one
LINE 90: of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p'ing and about to be attacked
LINE 91: by Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the
LINE 92: drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in
LINE 93: sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the
LINE 94: intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off
LINE 95: his army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is
LINE 96: nothing more nor less than the timely use of "bluff."]
LINE 97: 13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible
LINE 98: ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must
LINE 99: be divided.
LINE 100: [The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei
LINE 101: Yao-ch'en) rightly explains it thus: "If the enemy's dispositions are
LINE 102: visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions
LINE 103: being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in
LINE 104: order to guard against attack from every quarter."]
LINE 105: 14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up
LINE 106: into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate
LINE 107: parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.
LINE 108: 15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior
LINE 109: one, our opponents will be in dire straits.
LINE 110: 16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then
LINE 111: the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several
LINE 112: different points;
LINE 113: [Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's victories by
LINE 114: saying that "while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering
LINE 115: what he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to
LINE 116: do himself."]
LINE 117: and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers
LINE 118: we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.
LINE 119: 17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;
LINE 120: should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he
LINE 121: strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his
LINE 122: right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,
LINE 123: he will everywhere be weak.
LINE 124: [In Frederick the Great's _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: "A
LINE 125: defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those
LINE 126: generals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every
LINE 127: point, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,
LINE 128: having only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,
LINE 129: and acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater."]
LINE 130: 18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible
LINE 131: attacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make
LINE 132: these preparations against us.
LINE 133: [The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is "to compel the
LINE 134: enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force
LINE 135: against each fraction in turn."]
LINE 136: 19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may
LINE 137: concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.
LINE 138: [What Sun Tzŭ evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of
LINE 139: distances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a
LINE 140: general to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,
LINE 141: and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the
LINE 142: right hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.
LINE 143: Among many such successful junctions which military history records,
LINE 144: one of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher
LINE 145: just at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]
LINE 146: 20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be
LINE 147: impotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the
LINE 148: left, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the
LINE 149: van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything
LINE 150: under a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by
LINE 151: several _li_!
LINE 152: [The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,
LINE 153: but the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an
LINE 154: army advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of
LINE 155: which has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the
LINE 156: various detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise
LINE 157: instructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be
LINE 158: able to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu's note may be worth
LINE 159: quoting here: "If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to
LINE 160: concentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will
LINE 161: be forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we
LINE 162: hold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall
LINE 163: be brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support
LINE 164: will be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there
LINE 165: is any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of
LINE 166: the army."]
LINE 167: 21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own
LINE 168: in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.
LINE 169: I say then that victory can be achieved.
LINE 170: [Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended
LINE 171: in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its
LINE 172: incorporation in Yüeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzŭ's death.
LINE 173: With his present assertion compare IV. § 4. Chang Yu is the only one to
LINE 174: point out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain:
LINE 175: "In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, 'One may _know_
LINE 176: how to conquer without being able to _do_ it,' whereas here we have the
LINE 177: statement that 'victory' can be achieved.' The explanation is, that in
LINE 178: the former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under
LINE 179: discussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot
LINE 180: make certain of beating him. But the present passage refers
LINE 181: particularly to the soldiers of Yüeh who, according to Sun Tzŭ's
LINE 182: calculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the
LINE 183: impending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be
LINE 184: achieved."]
LINE 185: 22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from
LINE 186: fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of
LINE 187: their success.
LINE 188: [An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: "Know beforehand all
LINE 189: plans conducive to our success and to the enemy's failure."
LINE 190: 23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.
LINE 191: [Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy
LINE 192: on being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his
LINE 193: policy is to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku
LINE 194: Liang, who sent the scornful present of a woman's head-dress to Ssu-ma
LINE 195: I, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.]
LINE 196: Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.
LINE 197: 24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may
LINE 198: know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.
LINE 199: [Cf. IV. § 6.]
LINE 200: 25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain
LINE 201: is to conceal them;
LINE 202: [The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is
LINE 203: perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see _supra_ § 9) as "showing
LINE 204: no sign" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your
LINE 205: brain.]
LINE 206: conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the
LINE 207: subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
LINE 208: [Tu Mu explains: "Though the enemy may have clever and capable
LINE 209: officers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us."]
LINE 210: 26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own
LINE 211: tactics—that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.
LINE 212: 27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can
LINE 213: see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.
LINE 214: [_I.e._, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they
LINE 215: cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has
LINE 216: preceded the battle.]
LINE 217: 28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but
LINE 218: let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
LINE 219: [As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: "There is but one root-principle
LINE 220: underlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in
LINE 221: number." With this compare Col. Henderson: "The rules of strategy are
LINE 222: few and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by
LINE 223: familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no
LINE 224: more teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of
LINE 225: grammar will teach him to write like Gibbon."]
LINE 226: 29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural
LINE 227: course runs away from high places and hastens downwards.
LINE 228: 30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what
LINE 229: is weak.
LINE 230: [Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]
LINE 231: 31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over
LINE 232: which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the
LINE 233: foe whom he is facing.
LINE 234: 32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare
LINE 235: there are no constant conditions.
LINE 236: 33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and
LINE 237: thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.
LINE 238: 34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always
LINE 239: equally predominant;
LINE 240: [That is, as Wang Hsi says: "they predominate alternately."]
LINE 241: the four seasons make way for each other in turn.
LINE 242: [Literally, "have no invariable seat."]
LINE 243: There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and
LINE 244: waxing.
LINE 245: [Cf. V. § 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the
LINE 246: want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature.
LINE 247: The comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of
LINE 248: the phenomena which Sun Tzŭ mentions is by no means paralleled in war.]
