LINE 1: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is
LINE 2: to take the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it
LINE 3: is not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than
LINE 4: to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire
LINE 5: than to destroy them.
LINE 6: [The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted
LINE 7: nominally of 12500 men; according to Ts'ao Kung, the equivalent of a
LINE 8: regiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists
LINE 9: from any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company
LINE 10: contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives
LINE 11: the exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.]
LINE 12: 2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme
LINE 13: excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's
LINE 14: resistance without fighting.
LINE 15: [Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old
LINE 16: Chinese general. Moltke's greatest triumph, the capitulation of the
LINE 17: huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]
LINE 18: 3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy's plans;
LINE 19: [Perhaps the word "balk" falls short of expressing the full force of
LINE 20: the Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one
LINE 21: might be content to foil the enemy's stratagems one after another, but
LINE 22: an active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in
LINE 23: his note: "When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must
LINE 24: anticipate him by delivering our own attack first."]
LINE 25: the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces;
LINE 26: [Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzŭ, in
LINE 27: speaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or
LINE 28: principalities into which the China of his day was split up.]
LINE 29: the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field;
LINE 30: [When he is already at full strength.]
LINE 31: and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.
LINE 32: 4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be
LINE 33: avoided.
LINE 34: [Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in
LINE 35: 1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley,
LINE 36: Mafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would
LINE 37: have been masters of the situation before the British were ready
LINE 38: seriously to oppose them.]
LINE 39: The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements
LINE 40: of war, will take up three whole months;
LINE 41: [It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as
LINE 42: "mantlets", described. Ts'ao Kung simply defines them as "large
LINE 43: shields," but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch'uan, who says
LINE 44: they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city
LINE 45: walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman
LINE 46: _testudo_, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in
LINE 47: repelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch'en Hao. See _supra_ II. 14.
LINE 48: The name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the "movable
LINE 49: shelters" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators.
LINE 50: They were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled
LINE 51: from within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey
LINE 52: parties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the
LINE 53: encircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called "wooden
LINE 54: donkeys."]
LINE 55: and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three
LINE 56: months more.
LINE 57: [These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of
LINE 58: the enemy's walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence,
LINE 59: and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding
LINE 60: note.]
LINE 61: 5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men
LINE 62: to the assault like swarming ants,
LINE 63: [This vivid simile of Ts'ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army
LINE 64: of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing
LINE 65: patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the
LINE 66: place before his engines of war are ready.]
LINE 67: with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town
LINE 68: still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.
LINE 69: [We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port
LINE 70: Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]
LINE 71: 6. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any
LINE 72: fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he
LINE 73: overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
LINE 74: [Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no
LINE 75: harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after
LINE 76: having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed "Father and mother
LINE 77: of the people."]
LINE 78: 7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire,
LINE 79: and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.
LINE 80: [Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of
LINE 81: the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: "And thus,
LINE 82: the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect."]
LINE 83: This is the method of attacking by stratagem.
LINE 84: 8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to
LINE 85: surround him; if five to one, to attack him;
LINE 86: [Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]
LINE 87: if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.
LINE 88: [Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it
LINE 89: appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts'ao Kung, however,
LINE 90: gives a clue to Sun Tzŭ's meaning: "Being two to the enemy's one, we
LINE 91: may use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some
LINE 92: special diversion." Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: "If our
LINE 93: force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up
LINE 94: into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall
LINE 95: upon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed
LINE 96: from behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front."
LINE 97: This is what is meant by saying that 'one part may be used in the
LINE 98: regular way, and the other for some special diversion.' Tu Mu does not
LINE 99: understand that dividing one's army is simply an irregular, just as
LINE 100: concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too
LINE 101: hasty in calling this a mistake."]
LINE 102: 9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;
LINE 103: [Li Ch'uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase: "If
LINE 104: attackers and attacked are equally matched in strength, only the able
LINE 105: general will fight."]
LINE 106: if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;
LINE 107: [The meaning, "we can _watch_ the enemy," is certainly a great
LINE 108: improvement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very
LINE 109: good authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying
LINE 110: only applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in
LINE 111: numbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and
LINE 112: discipline.]
LINE 113: if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
LINE 114: 10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in
LINE 115: the end it must be captured by the larger force.
LINE 116: 11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is
LINE 117: complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is
LINE 118: defective, the State will be weak.
LINE 119: [As Li Ch'uan tersely puts it: "Gap indicates deficiency; if the
LINE 120: general's ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed
LINE 121: in his profession), his army will lack strength."]
LINE 122: 12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his
LINE 123: army:—
LINE 124: 13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant
LINE 125: of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.
LINE 126: [Li Ch'uan adds the comment: "It is like tying together the legs of a
LINE 127: thoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop." One would naturally
LINE 128: think of "the ruler" in this passage as being at home, and trying to
LINE 129: direct the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators
LINE 130: understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T'ai Kung: "A
LINE 131: kingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be
LINE 132: directed from within." Of course it is true that, during an engagement,
LINE 133: or when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the
LINE 134: thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he
LINE 135: will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong
LINE 136: orders.]
LINE 137: 14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he
LINE 138: administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in
LINE 139: an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.
LINE 140: [Ts'ao Kung's note is, freely translated: "The military sphere and the
LINE 141: civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can't handle an army in kid
LINE 142: gloves." And Chang Yu says: "Humanity and justice are the principles on
LINE 143: which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility,
LINE 144: on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate
LINE 145: the governing of an army"—to that of a State, understood.]
LINE 146: 15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,
LINE 147: [That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]
LINE 148: through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to
LINE 149: circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.
LINE 150: [I follow Mei Yao-ch'en here. The other commentators refer not to the
LINE 151: ruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu
LINE 152: says: "If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he
LINE 153: must not be entrusted with a position of authority." Tu Mu quotes: "The
LINE 154: skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the
LINE 155: covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in
LINE 156: establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in
LINE 157: action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid
LINE 158: man has no fear of death."]
LINE 159: 16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to
LINE 160: come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy
LINE 161: into the army, and flinging victory away.
LINE 162: 17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He
LINE 163: will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
LINE 164: [Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive;
LINE 165: if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will
LINE 166: invariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive
LINE 167: or the defensive.]
LINE 168: (2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior
LINE 169: forces.
LINE 170: [This is not merely the general's ability to estimate numbers
LINE 171: correctly, as Li Ch'uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the
LINE 172: saying more satisfactorily: "By applying the art of war, it is possible
LINE 173: with a lesser force to defeat a greater, and _vice versa_. The secret
LINE 174: lies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.
LINE 175: Thus Wu Tzŭ says: 'With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an
LINE 176: inferior one, make for difficult ground.'"]
LINE 177: (3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout
LINE 178: all its ranks.
LINE 179: (4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy
LINE 180: unprepared.
LINE 181: (5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by
LINE 182: the sovereign.
LINE 183: [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: "It is the sovereign's function to
LINE 184: give broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of
LINE 185: the general." It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which
LINE 186: have been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on
LINE 187: the part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his
LINE 188: extraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central
LINE 189: authority.]
LINE 190: Victory lies in the knowledge of these five points.
LINE 191: [Literally, "These five things are knowledge of the principle of
LINE 192: victory."]
LINE 193: 18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need
LINE 194: not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not
LINE 195: the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.
LINE 196: [Li Ch'uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch'in, who in 383 A.D.
LINE 197: marched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to
LINE 198: despise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An
LINE 199: and Huan Ch'ung, he boastfully replied: "I have the population of eight
LINE 200: provinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one
LINE 201: million; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely
LINE 202: throwing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?"
LINE 203: Nevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei
LINE 204: River, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.]
LINE 205: If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every
LINE 206: battle.
LINE 207: [Chang Yu said: "Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive,
LINE 208: knowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive." He adds:
LINE 209: "Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an
LINE 210: attack." It would be hard to find a better epitome of the
LINE 211: root-principle of war.]
