LINE 1: [Ts'ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for the title of
LINE 2: this chapter: "marching and countermarching on the part of the two
LINE 3: armies with a view to discovering each other's condition." Tu Mu says:
LINE 4: "It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be
LINE 5: discovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain
LINE 6: secret, which leads to victory; show your dispositions, and your
LINE 7: condition will become patent, which leads to defeat." Wang Hsi remarks
LINE 8: that the good general can "secure success by modifying his tactics to
LINE 9: meet those of the enemy."]
LINE 10: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond
LINE 11: the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of
LINE 12: defeating the enemy.
LINE 13: 2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the
LINE 14: opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
LINE 15: [That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy's part.]
LINE 16: 3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,
LINE 17: [Chang Yu says this is done, "By concealing the disposition of his
LINE 18: troops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions."]
LINE 19: but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.
LINE 20: 4. Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able
LINE 21: to _do_ it.
LINE 22: 5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat
LINE 23: the enemy means taking the offensive.
LINE 24: [I retain the sense found in a similar passage in §§ 1-3, in spite of
LINE 25: the fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they
LINE 26: give, "He who cannot conquer takes the defensive," is plausible
LINE 27: enough.]
LINE 28: 6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;
LINE 29: attacking, a superabundance of strength.
LINE 30: 7. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret
LINE 31: recesses of the earth;
LINE 32: [Literally, "hides under the ninth earth," which is a metaphor
LINE 33: indicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may
LINE 34: not know his whereabouts."]
LINE 35: he who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of
LINE 36: heaven.
LINE 37: [Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a
LINE 38: thunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the
LINE 39: opinion of most of the commentators.]
LINE 40: Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the
LINE 41: other, a victory that is complete.
LINE 42: 8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is
LINE 43: not the acme of excellence.
LINE 44: [As Ts'ao Kung remarks, "the thing is to see the plant before it has
LINE 45: germinated," to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li
LINE 46: Ch'uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the
LINE 47: vastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city
LINE 48: of Ch'eng-an, said to his officers: "Gentlemen, we are going to
LINE 49: annihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner." The officers
LINE 50: hardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But
LINE 51: Han Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever
LINE 52: stratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and
LINE 53: inflict a crushing defeat on his adversary."]
LINE 54: 9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and
LINE 55: the whole Empire says, "Well done!"
LINE 56: [True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: "To plan secretly, to move
LINE 57: surreptitiously, to foil the enemy's intentions and balk his schemes,
LINE 58: so that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood."
LINE 59: Sun Tzŭ reserves his approbation for things that
LINE 60: "the world's coarse thumb
LINE 61: And finger fail to plumb."
LINE 62: 10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;
LINE 63: ["Autumn hair" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in
LINE 64: autumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one
LINE 65: in Chinese writers.]
LINE 66: to see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of
LINE 67: thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
LINE 68: [Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick
LINE 69: hearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu,
LINE 70: who at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a
LINE 71: mustard seed; and Shih K'uang, a blind musician who could hear the
LINE 72: footsteps of a mosquito.]
LINE 73: 11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,
LINE 74: but excels in winning with ease.
LINE 75: [The last half is literally "one who, conquering, excels in easy
LINE 76: conquering." Mei Yao-ch'en says: "He who only sees the obvious, wins
LINE 77: his battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things,
LINE 78: wins with ease."]
LINE 79: 12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor
LINE 80: credit for courage.
LINE 81: [Tu Mu explains this very well: "Inasmuch as his victories are gained
LINE 82: over circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large
LINE 83: knows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch
LINE 84: as the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he
LINE 85: receives no credit for courage."]
LINE 86: 13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.
LINE 87: [Ch'en Hao says: "He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile
LINE 88: attacks." The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu: "One
LINE 89: who seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at
LINE 90: winning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished;
LINE 91: whereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are
LINE 92: not yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably
LINE 93: win."]
LINE 94: Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it
LINE 95: means conquering an enemy that is already defeated.
LINE 96: 14. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes
LINE 97: defeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the
LINE 98: enemy.
LINE 99: [A "counsel of perfection" as Tu Mu truly observes. "Position" need not
LINE 100: be confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes
LINE 101: all the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to
LINE 102: increase the safety of his army.]
LINE 103: 15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle
LINE 104: after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat
LINE 105: first fights and afterwards looks for victory.
LINE 106: [Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: "In warfare, first lay plans which
LINE 107: will ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not
LINE 108: begin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no
LINE 109: longer be assured."]
LINE 110: 16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly
LINE 111: adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control
LINE 112: success.
LINE 113: 17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;
LINE 114: secondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,
LINE 115: Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.
LINE 116: 18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to
LINE 117: Measurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of
LINE 118: chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.
LINE 119: [It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the
LINE 120: Chinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,
LINE 121: which enable us to form an estimate of the enemy's strength, and to
LINE 122: make calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a
LINE 123: general weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy's chances with our own;
LINE 124: if the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty
LINE 125: lies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a
LINE 126: calculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the
LINE 127: second term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a
LINE 128: consideration of the enemy's general position or condition, while the
LINE 129: third term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other
LINE 130: hand, Tu Mu says: "The question of relative strength having been
LINE 131: settled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play." Ho
LINE 132: Shih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to
LINE 133: the third term as being a calculation of numbers.]
LINE 134: 19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight
LINE 135: placed in the scale against a single grain.
LINE 136: [Literally, "a victorious army is like an _i_ (20 oz.) weighed against
LINE 137: a _shu_ (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a _shu_ weighed against an _i_."
LINE 138: The point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force,
LINE 139: flushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his
LINE 140: note on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the _i_ to be 24 Chinese ounces,
LINE 141: and corrects Chu Hsi's statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li
LINE 142: Ch'uan of the T'ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]
LINE 143: 20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up
LINE 144: waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical
LINE 145: dispositions.
