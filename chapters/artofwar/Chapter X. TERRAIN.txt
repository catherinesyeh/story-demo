LINE 1: [Only about a third of the chapter, comprising §§ 1-13, deals with
LINE 2: "terrain," the subject being more fully treated in ch. XI. The "six
LINE 3: calamities" are discussed in §§ 14-20, and the rest of the chapter is
LINE 4: again a mere string of desultory remarks, though not less interesting,
LINE 5: perhaps, on that account.]
LINE 6: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1)
LINE 7: Accessible ground;
LINE 8: [Mei Yao-ch'en says: "plentifully provided with roads and means of
LINE 9: communications."]
LINE 10: (2) entangling ground;
LINE 11: [The same commentator says: "Net-like country, venturing into which you
LINE 12: become entangled."]
LINE 13: (3) temporising ground;
LINE 14: [Ground which allows you to "stave off" or "delay."]
LINE 15: (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great
LINE 16: distance from the enemy.
LINE 17: [It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this
LINE 18: classification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the
LINE 19: Chinaman's unquestioning acceptance of glaring cross-divisions such as
LINE 20: the above.]
LINE 21: 2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called
LINE 22: _accessible_.
LINE 23: 3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in
LINE 24: occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of
LINE 25: supplies.
LINE 26: [The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says,
LINE 27: "not to allow the enemy to cut your communications." In view of
LINE 28: Napoleon's dictum, "the secret of war lies in the communications," [1]
LINE 29: we could wish that Sun Tzŭ had done more than skirt the edge of this
LINE 30: important subject here and in I. § 10, VII. § 11. Col. Henderson says:
LINE 31: "The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an
LINE 32: army as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duelist who
LINE 33: finds his adversary's point menacing him with certain death, and his
LINE 34: own guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary's movements,
LINE 35: and to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the commander
LINE 36: whose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false
LINE 37: position, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his
LINE 38: plans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments,
LINE 39: and to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time
LINE 40: to prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will
LINE 41: entail the ruin or surrender of his whole army." [2]
LINE 42: Then you will be able to fight with advantage.
LINE 43: 4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called
LINE 44: _entangling_.
LINE 45: 5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may
LINE 46: sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your
LINE 47: coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,
LINE 48: disaster will ensue.
LINE 49: 6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the
LINE 50: first move, it is called _temporising_ ground.
LINE 51: [Tu Mu says: "Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the
LINE 52: situation remains at a deadlock."]
LINE 53: 7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an
LINE 54: attractive bait,
LINE 55: [Tu Yu says, "turning their backs on us and pretending to flee." But
LINE 56: this is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our
LINE 57: position.]
LINE 58: it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus
LINE 59: enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come
LINE 60: out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.
LINE 61: 8. With regard to _narrow passes_, if you can occupy them first, let
LINE 62: them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.
LINE 63: [Because then, as Tu Yu observes, "the initiative will lie with us, and
LINE 64: by making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at our
LINE 65: mercy."]
LINE 66: 9. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after
LINE 67: him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly
LINE 68: garrisoned.
LINE 69: 10. With regard to _precipitous heights_, if you are beforehand with
LINE 70: your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there
LINE 71: wait for him to come up.
LINE 72: [Ts'ao Kung says: "The particular advantage of securing heights and
LINE 73: defiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy."
LINE 74: [For the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to, see VI. § 2].
LINE 75: Chang Yu tells the following anecdote of P'ei Hsing-chien (A.D.
LINE 76: 619-682), who was sent on a punitive expedition against the Turkic
LINE 77: tribes. "At night he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been
LINE 78: completely fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders
LINE 79: that the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was
LINE 80: highly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the
LINE 81: extra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P'ei Hsing-chien,
LINE 82: however, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as
LINE 83: quickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which
LINE 84: flooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve
LINE 85: feet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned
LINE 86: that they had been in the wrong. 'How did you know what was going to
LINE 87: happen?' they asked. P'ei Hsing-chien replied: 'From this time forward
LINE 88: be content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.' From
LINE 89: this it may be seen," Chang Yu continues, "that high and sunny places
LINE 90: are advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are
LINE 91: immune from disastrous floods."]
LINE 92: 11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but
LINE 93: retreat and try to entice him away.
LINE 94: [The turning point of Li Shih-min's campaign in 621 A.D. against the
LINE 95: two rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch'ung, Prince of
LINE 96: Cheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spite of which Tou
LINE 97: Chien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was
LINE 98: defeated and taken prisoner. See _Chiu T'ang Shu_, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso,
LINE 99: and also ch. 54.]
LINE 100: 12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the
LINE 101: strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a
LINE 102: battle,
LINE 103: [The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and
LINE 104: wearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, "we should be
LINE 105: exhausted and our adversary fresh and keen."]
LINE 106: and fighting will be to your disadvantage.
LINE 107: 13. These six are the principles connected with Earth.
LINE 108: [Or perhaps, "the principles relating to ground." See, however, I. §
LINE 109: 8.]
LINE 110: The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to
LINE 111: study them.
LINE 112: 14. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from
LINE 113: natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.
LINE 114: These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5)
LINE 115: disorganisation; (6) rout.
LINE 116: 15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against
LINE 117: another ten times its size, the result will be the _flight_ of the
LINE 118: former.
LINE 119: 16. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too
LINE 120: weak, the result is _insubordination_.
LINE 121: [Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T'ien Pu [_Hsin T'ang Shu_, ch. 148],
LINE 122: who was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army against
LINE 123: Wang T'ing-ts'ou. But the whole time he was in command, his soldiers
LINE 124: treated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his authority
LINE 125: by riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a time. T'ien
LINE 126: Pu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when, after some
LINE 127: months had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops
LINE 128: turned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the
LINE 129: unfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat.]
LINE 130: When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the
LINE 131: result is _collapse_.
LINE 132: [Ts'ao Kung says: "The officers are energetic and want to press on, the
LINE 133: common soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse."]
LINE 134: 17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on
LINE 135: meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of
LINE 136: resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is
LINE 137: in a position to fight, the result is _ruin_.
LINE 138: [Wang Hsi's note is: "This means, the general is angry without cause,
LINE 139: and at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate
LINE 140: officers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of
LINE 141: ruin upon his head."]
LINE 142: 18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are
LINE 143: not clear and distinct;
LINE 144: [Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 4) says: "If the commander gives his orders with
LINE 145: decision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice; if his moves
LINE 146: are made without vacillation, the soldiers will not be in two minds
LINE 147: about doing their duty." General Baden-Powell says, italicizing the
LINE 148: words: "The secret of getting successful work out of your trained men
LINE 149: lies in one nutshell—in the clearness of the instructions they
LINE 150: receive." [3] Cf. also Wu Tzŭ ch. 3: "the most fatal defect in a
LINE 151: military leader is difference; the worst calamities that befall an army
LINE 152: arise from hesitation."]
LINE 153: when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men,
LINE 154: [Tu Mu says: "Neither officers nor men have any regular routine."]
LINE 155: and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is
LINE 156: utter _disorganisation_.
LINE 157: 19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an
LINE 158: inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment
LINE 159: against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the
LINE 160: front rank, the result must be a _rout_.
LINE 161: [Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues:
LINE 162: "Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest spirits should be
LINE 163: appointed to serve in the front ranks, both in order to strengthen the
LINE 164: resolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy." Cf. the primi
LINE 165: ordines of Caesar ("De Bello Gallico," V. 28, 44, et al.).]
LINE 166: 20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully
LINE 167: noted by the general who has attained a responsible post.
LINE 168: [See _supra_, § 13.]
LINE 169: 21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier's best ally;
LINE 170: [Ch'en Hao says: "The advantages of weather and season are not equal to
LINE 171: those connected with ground."]
LINE 172: but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of
LINE 173: victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and
LINE 174: distances, constitutes the test of a great general.
LINE 175: 22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into
LINE 176: practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practises
LINE 177: them, will surely be defeated.
LINE 178: 23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even
LINE 179: though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory,
LINE 180: then you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.
LINE 181: [Cf. VIII. § 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch'in dynasty, who is said
LINE 182: to have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the _San
LINE 183: Lueh_, has these words attributed to him: "The responsibility of
LINE 184: setting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance
LINE 185: and retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will
LINE 186: hardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened
LINE 187: monarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country's
LINE 188: cause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel]." This means that
LINE 189: "in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military
LINE 190: commander must be absolute." Chang Yu also quote the saying: "Decrees
LINE 191: from the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp."]
LINE 192: 24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without
LINE 193: fearing disgrace,
LINE 194: [It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for
LINE 195: a soldier is to retreat.]
LINE 196: whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for
LINE 197: his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
LINE 198: [A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese "happy warrior."
LINE 199: Such a man, says Ho Shih, "even if he had to suffer punishment, would
LINE 200: not regret his conduct."]
LINE 201: 25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you
LINE 202: into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and
LINE 203: they will stand by you even unto death.
LINE 204: [Cf. I. § 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture
LINE 205: of the famous general Wu Ch'i, from whose treatise on war I have
LINE 206: frequently had occasion to quote: "He wore the same clothes and ate the
LINE 207: same food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a
LINE 208: horse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations
LINE 209: wrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his
LINE 210: soldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch'i himself sucked out
LINE 211: the virus. The soldier's mother, hearing this, began wailing and
LINE 212: lamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: 'Why do you cry? Your son is
LINE 213: only a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has
LINE 214: sucked the poison from his sore.' The woman replied, 'Many years ago,
LINE 215: Lord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him
LINE 216: afterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And
LINE 217: now that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I
LINE 218: know not where.'" Li Ch'uan mentions the Viscount of Ch'u, who invaded
LINE 219: the small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to
LINE 220: him: "Many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold." So he
LINE 221: made a round of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and
LINE 222: straightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with
LINE 223: floss silk.]
LINE 224: 26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority
LINE 225: felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable,
LINE 226: moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to
LINE 227: spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.
LINE 228: [Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you,
LINE 229: they would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of
LINE 230: stern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was
LINE 231: occupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his
LINE 232: army not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by
LINE 233: force. Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who
LINE 234: happened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat
LINE 235: belonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation
LINE 236: helmet as a protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the
LINE 237: fact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to
LINE 238: palliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his
LINE 239: summary execution, the tears rolling down his face, however, as he did
LINE 240: so. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from
LINE 241: that time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked
LINE 242: up.]
LINE 243: 27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are
LINE 244: unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway
LINE 245: towards victory.
LINE 246: [That is, Ts'ao Kung says, "the issue in this case is uncertain."]
LINE 247: 28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that
LINE 248: our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway
LINE 249: towards victory.
LINE 250: [Cf. III. § 13 (1).]
LINE 251: 29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our
LINE 252: men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of
LINE 253: the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only
LINE 254: halfway towards victory.
LINE 255: 30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered;
LINE 256: once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.
LINE 257: [The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures
LINE 258: so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. "He does not move
LINE 259: recklessly," says Chang Yu, "so that when he does move, he makes no
LINE 260: mistakes."]
LINE 261: 31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your
LINE 262: victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you
LINE 263: may make your victory complete.
LINE 264: [Li Ch'uan sums up as follows: "Given a knowledge of three things—the
LINE 265: affairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of
LINE 266: earth—, victory will invariably crown your battles."]
