LINE 1: 1. Sun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as
LINE 2: the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their
LINE 3: numbers.
LINE 4: [That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with
LINE 5: subordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin's
LINE 6: famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: "How large
LINE 7: an army do you think I could lead?" "Not more than 100,000 men, your
LINE 8: Majesty." "And you?" asked the Emperor. "Oh!" he answered, "the more
LINE 9: the better."]
LINE 10: 2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different
LINE 11: from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting
LINE 12: signs and signals.
LINE 13: 3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the
LINE 14: enemy's attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct
LINE 15: and indirect.
LINE 16: [We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ's
LINE 17: treatise, the discussion of the _cheng_ and the _ch'i_." As it is by no
LINE 18: means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to
LINE 19: render them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well
LINE 20: to tabulate some of the commentators' remarks on the subject before
LINE 21: proceeding further. Li Ch'uan: "Facing the enemy is _cheng_, making
LINE 22: lateral diversion is _ch'i_. Chia Lin: "In presence of the enemy, your
LINE 23: troops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure
LINE 24: victory abnormal manœuvers must be employed." Mei Yao-ch'en: "_Ch'i_ is
LINE 25: active, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity,
LINE 26: activity brings the victory itself." Ho Shih: "We must cause the enemy
LINE 27: to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed,
LINE 28: and vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch'i_, and _ch'i_ may also be
LINE 29: _cheng_." He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when
LINE 30: marching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly
LINE 31: threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly
LINE 32: disconcerting his opponent. [Ch'ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,
LINE 33: the march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise manœuver was
LINE 34: _ch'i_." Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:
LINE 35: "Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch'i_ and
LINE 36: _cheng_. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: 'Direct warfare favours
LINE 37: frontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.' Ts'ao Kung
LINE 38: says: 'Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation;
LINE 39: appearing on the enemy's rear is an indirect manœuver.' Li Wei-kung
LINE 40: [6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: 'In war, to march straight ahead is
LINE 41: _cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch'i_.' These
LINE 42: writers simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch'i_ as _ch'i_; they do
LINE 43: not note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each
LINE 44: other like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on
LINE 45: the T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: 'A _ch'i_
LINE 46: manœuver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;
LINE 47: then our real attack will be _ch'i_, and vice versa. The whole secret
LINE 48: lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real
LINE 49: intent.'" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other
LINE 50: operation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;
LINE 51: whereas that is _ch'i_," which takes him by surprise or comes from an
LINE 52: unexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to
LINE 53: be _ch'i_," it immediately becomes _cheng_."]
LINE 54: 4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against
LINE 55: an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.
LINE 56: 5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,
LINE 57: but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.
LINE 58: [Chang Yu says: "Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding
LINE 59: the enemy's flanks or falling on his rear." A brilliant example of
LINE 60: "indirect tactics" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord
LINE 61: Roberts' night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.
LINE 62: [1]
LINE 63: 6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven
LINE 64: and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and
LINE 65: moon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away
LINE 66: but to return once more.
LINE 67: [Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of _ch'i_ and
LINE 68: _cheng_. But at present Sun Tzŭ is not speaking of _cheng_ at all,
LINE 69: unless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating
LINE 70: to it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been
LINE 71: pointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military
LINE 72: operations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply
LINE 73: have an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite
LINE 74: resource of a great leader.]
LINE 75: 7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of
LINE 76: these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.
LINE 77: 8. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red,
LINE 78: white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can
LINE 79: ever be seen.
LINE 80: 9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt,
LINE 81: sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can
LINE 82: ever be tasted.
LINE 83: 10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct
LINE 84: and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless
LINE 85: series of manœuvers.
LINE 86: 11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is
LINE 87: like moving in a circle—you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the
LINE 88: possibilities of their combination?
LINE 89: 12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even
LINE 90: roll stones along in its course.
LINE 91: 13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon
LINE 92: which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.
LINE 93: [The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is
LINE 94: used defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word
LINE 95: as "the measurement or estimation of distance." But this meaning does
LINE 96: not quite fit the illustrative simile in §. 15. Applying this
LINE 97: definition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of
LINE 98: _self-restraint_ which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until
LINE 99: the right moment, together with the power of judging when the right
LINE 100: moment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly
LINE 101: important one of being able to reserve their fire until the very
LINE 102: instant at which it will be most effective. When the "Victory" went
LINE 103: into action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for
LINE 104: several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying
LINE 105: with a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close
LINE 106: range, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on
LINE 107: the enemy's nearest ships.]
LINE 108: 14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and
LINE 109: prompt in his decision.
LINE 110: [The word "decision" would have reference to the measurement of
LINE 111: distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking.
LINE 112: But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzŭ meant to use the word in a
LINE 113: figurative sense comparable to our own idiom "short and sharp." Cf.
LINE 114: Wang Hsi's note, which after describing the falcon's mode of attack,
LINE 115: proceeds: "This is just how the 'psychological moment' should be seized
LINE 116: in war."]
LINE 117: 15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to
LINE 118: the releasing of the trigger.
LINE 119: [None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of
LINE 120: energy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by
LINE 121: the finger on the trigger.]
LINE 122: 16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming
LINE 123: disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos,
LINE 124: your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against
LINE 125: defeat.
LINE 126: [Mei Yao-ch'en says: "The subdivisions of the army having been
LINE 127: previously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating
LINE 128: and joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the
LINE 129: course of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real
LINE 130: disorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your
LINE 131: dispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out
LINE 132: of the question."]
LINE 133: 17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear
LINE 134: postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.
LINE 135: [In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone
LINE 136: down the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts'ao Kung throws
LINE 137: out a hint of the meaning in his brief note: "These things all serve to
LINE 138: destroy formation and conceal one's condition." But Tu Mu is the first
LINE 139: to put it quite plainly: "If you wish to feign confusion in order to
LINE 140: lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish
LINE 141: to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme
LINE 142: courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy
LINE 143: over-confident, you must have exceeding strength."]
LINE 144: 18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of
LINE 145: subdivision;
LINE 146: [See _supra_, § 1.]
LINE 147: concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of
LINE 148: latent energy;
LINE 149: [The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here
LINE 150: differently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:
LINE 151: "seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the
LINE 152: enemy will believe that we are really afraid."]
LINE 153: masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical
LINE 154: dispositions.
LINE 155: [Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han
LINE 156: Emperor: "Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report
LINE 157: on their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed
LINE 158: all their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm
LINE 159: soldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one
LINE 160: and all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone
LINE 161: opposed them, saying: 'When two countries go to war, they are naturally
LINE 162: inclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our
LINE 163: spies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some
LINE 164: _ruse_ on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to
LINE 165: attack.' The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the
LINE 166: trap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng."]
LINE 167: 19. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains
LINE 168: deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.
LINE 169: [Ts'ao Kung's note is "Make a display of weakness and want." Tu Mu
LINE 170: says: "If our force happens to be superior to the enemy's, weakness may
LINE 171: be simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led
LINE 172: to believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact,
LINE 173: all the enemy's movements should be determined by the signs that we
LINE 174: choose to give him." Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a
LINE 175: descendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch'i State being at war with
LINE 176: Wei, sent T'ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P'ang Chuan, who
LINE 177: happened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: "The
LINE 178: Ch'i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary
LINE 179: despises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account." Accordingly,
LINE 180: when the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders
LINE 181: to show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the
LINE 182: night after only 20,000. P'ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to
LINE 183: himself: "I knew these men of Ch'i were cowards: their numbers have
LINE 184: already fallen away by more than half." In his retreat, Sun Pin came to
LINE 185: a narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach
LINE 186: after dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon
LINE 187: it the words: "Under this tree shall P'ang Chuan die." Then, as night
LINE 188: began to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by,
LINE 189: with orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P'ang
LINE 190: Chuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in
LINE 191: order to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled
LINE 192: by a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The
LINE 193: above is Tu Mu's version of the story; the _Shih Chi_, less
LINE 194: dramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P'ang Chuan
LINE 195: cut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of
LINE 196: his army.] ]
LINE 197: He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.
LINE 198: 20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body
LINE 199: of picked men he lies in wait for him.
LINE 200: [With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, "He lies in
LINE 201: wait with the main body of his troops."]
LINE 202: 21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and
LINE 203: does not require too much from individuals.
LINE 204: [Tu Mu says: "He first of all considers the power of his army in the
LINE 205: bulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each
LINE 206: men according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from
LINE 207: the untalented."]
LINE 208: Hence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined
LINE 209: energy.
LINE 210: 22. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it
LINE 211: were like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or
LINE 212: stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a
LINE 213: slope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,
LINE 214: to go rolling down.
LINE 215: [Ts'au Kung calls this "the use of natural or inherent power."]
LINE 216: 23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum
LINE 217: of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So
LINE 218: much on the subject of energy.
LINE 219: [The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu's opinion, is the paramount
LINE 220: importance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. "Great
LINE 221: results," he adds, "can thus be achieved with small forces."]
