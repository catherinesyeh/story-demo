LINE 1: Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was
LINE 2: like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in
LINE 3: stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have
LINE 4: been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some
LINE 5: marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been
LINE 6: softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.
LINE 7: The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment
LINE 8: over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them
LINE 9: off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his
LINE 10: linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for
LINE 11: he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a
LINE 12: lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,
LINE 13: that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were
LINE 14: quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering
LINE 15: eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. He had had
LINE 16: them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.
LINE 17: "So you were never in London before?" said Mr. Wemmick to me.
LINE 18: "No," said I.
LINE 19: "_I_ was new here once," said Mr. Wemmick. "Rum to think of now!"
LINE 20: "You are well acquainted with it now?"
LINE 21: "Why, yes," said Mr. Wemmick. "I know the moves of it."
LINE 22: "Is it a very wicked place?" I asked, more for the sake of saying
LINE 23: something than for information.
LINE 24: "You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are
LINE 25: plenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you."
LINE 26: "If there is bad blood between you and them," said I, to soften it off
LINE 27: a little.
LINE 28: "O! I don't know about bad blood," returned Mr. Wemmick; "there's not
LINE 29: much bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by
LINE 30: it."
LINE 31: "That makes it worse."
LINE 32: "You think so?" returned Mr. Wemmick. "Much about the same, I should
LINE 33: say."
LINE 34: He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before
LINE 35: him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the
LINE 36: streets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a
LINE 37: mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the
LINE 38: top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical
LINE 39: appearance, and that he was not smiling at all.
LINE 40: "Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?" I asked Mr. Wemmick.
LINE 41: "Yes," said he, nodding in the direction. "At Hammersmith, west of
LINE 42: London."
LINE 43: "Is that far?"
LINE 44: "Well! Say five miles."
LINE 45: "Do you know him?"
LINE 46: "Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me
LINE 47: with an approving air. "Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!"
LINE 48: There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
LINE 49: these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways
LINE 50: at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,
LINE 51: when he said here we were at Barnard's Inn. My depression was not
LINE 52: alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment
LINE 53: to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town
LINE 54: was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a
LINE 55: disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection
LINE 56: of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club
LINE 57: for Tom-cats.
LINE 58: We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an
LINE 59: introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
LINE 60: like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in
LINE 61: it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the
LINE 62: most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever
LINE 63: seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those
LINE 64: houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and
LINE 65: curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable
LINE 66: makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,
LINE 67: as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of
LINE 68: Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the
LINE 69: present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy
LINE 70: mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,
LINE 71: and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and
LINE 72: humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry
LINE 73: rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and
LINE 74: cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand
LINE 75: besides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,
LINE 76: "Try Barnard's Mixture."
LINE 77: So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great
LINE 78: expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. "Ah!" said he,
LINE 79: mistaking me; "the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does
LINE 80: me."
LINE 81: He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which
LINE 82: appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of
LINE 83: those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
LINE 84: themselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on
LINE 85: the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was
LINE 86: a label on the letter-box, "Return shortly."
LINE 87: "He hardly thought you'd come so soon," Mr. Wemmick explained. "You
LINE 88: don't want me any more?"
LINE 89: "No, thank you," said I.
LINE 90: "As I keep the cash," Mr. Wemmick observed, "we shall most likely meet
LINE 91: pretty often. Good day."
LINE 92: "Good day."
LINE 93: I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he
LINE 94: thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting
LINE 95: himself,—
LINE 96: "To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands?"
LINE 97: I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,
LINE 98: but said yes.
LINE 99: "I have got so out of it!" said Mr. Wemmick,—"except at last. Very
LINE 100: glad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!"
LINE 101: When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window
LINE 102: and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it
LINE 103: came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not
LINE 104: put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view
LINE 105: of the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully
LINE 106: looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.
LINE 107: Mr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly
LINE 108: maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my
LINE 109: name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
LINE 110: window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose
LINE 111: before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a
LINE 112: member of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under
LINE 113: each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of
LINE 114: breath.
LINE 115: "Mr. Pip?" said he.
LINE 116: "Mr. Pocket?" said I.
LINE 117: "Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a
LINE 118: coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would
LINE 119: come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,—not
LINE 120: that that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, you
LINE 121: might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden
LINE 122: Market to get it good."
LINE 123: For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my
LINE 124: head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think
LINE 125: this was a dream.
LINE 126: "Dear me!" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "This door sticks so!"
LINE 127: As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
LINE 128: the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold
LINE 129: them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with
LINE 130: the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,
LINE 131: that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite
LINE 132: door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start
LINE 133: out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.
LINE 134: "Pray come in," said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "Allow me to lead the way. I
LINE 135: am rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably
LINE 136: well till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably
LINE 137: through to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk
LINE 138: about London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As
LINE 139: to our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied
LINE 140: from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your
LINE 141: expense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions. As to our lodging, it's
LINE 142: not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my
LINE 143: father hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take
LINE 144: it, if he had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables
LINE 145: and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You
LINE 146: mustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,
LINE 147: because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little
LINE 148: bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;
LINE 149: the furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the
LINE 150: purpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it. The
LINE 151: chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't
LINE 152: fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the
LINE 153: fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite
LINE 154: ashamed."
LINE 155: As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,
LINE 156: One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I
LINE 157: knew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,—
LINE 158: "Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!"
LINE 159: "And you," said I, "are the pale young gentleman!"
