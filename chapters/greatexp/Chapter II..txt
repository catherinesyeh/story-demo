LINE 1: My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,
LINE 2: and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours
LINE 3: because she had brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find
LINE 4: out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a
LINE 5: hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her
LINE 6: husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both
LINE 7: brought up by hand.
LINE 8: She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general
LINE 9: impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe
LINE 10: was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
LINE 11: face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to
LINE 12: have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,
LINE 13: good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sort
LINE 14: of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.
LINE 15: My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
LINE 16: redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
LINE 17: she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall
LINE 18: and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her
LINE 19: figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in
LINE 20: front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful
LINE 21: merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this
LINE 22: apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn
LINE 23: it at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken
LINE 24: it off, every day of her life.
LINE 25: Joe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of
LINE 26: the dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time. When I
LINE 27: ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was
LINE 28: sitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and
LINE 29: having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment
LINE 30: I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,
LINE 31: sitting in the chimney corner.
LINE 32: "Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she's
LINE 33: out now, making it a baker's dozen."
LINE 34: "Is she?"
LINE 35: "Yes, Pip," said Joe; "and what's worse, she's got Tickler with her."
LINE 36: At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat
LINE 37: round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler
LINE 38: was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled
LINE 39: frame.
LINE 40: "She sot down," said Joe, "and she got up, and she made a grab at
LINE 41: Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That's what she did," said Joe, slowly
LINE 42: clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at
LINE 43: it; "she Ram-paged out, Pip."
LINE 44: "Has she been gone long, Joe?" I always treated him as a larger species
LINE 45: of child, and as no more than my equal.
LINE 46: "Well," said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, "she's been on the
LINE 47: Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She's a-coming! Get
LINE 48: behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you."
LINE 49: I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,
LINE 50: and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,
LINE 51: and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by
LINE 52: throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to
LINE 53: get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly
LINE 54: fenced me up there with his great leg.
LINE 55: "Where have you been, you young monkey?" said Mrs. Joe, stamping her
LINE 56: foot. "Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with
LINE 57: fret and fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you
LINE 58: was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys."
LINE 59: "I have only been to the churchyard," said I, from my stool, crying and
LINE 60: rubbing myself.
LINE 61: "Churchyard!" repeated my sister. "If it warn't for me you'd have been
LINE 62: to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by
LINE 63: hand?"
LINE 64: "You did," said I.
LINE 65: "And why did I do it, I should like to know?" exclaimed my sister.
LINE 66: I whimpered, "I don't know."
LINE 67: "_I_ don't!" said my sister. "I'd never do it again! I know that. I may
LINE 68: truly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were.
LINE 69: It's bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife (and him a Gargery) without
LINE 70: being your mother."
LINE 71: My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at
LINE 72: the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the
LINE 73: mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was
LINE 74: under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me
LINE 75: in the avenging coals.
LINE 76: "Hah!" said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. "Churchyard,
LINE 77: indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two." One of us, by the by,
LINE 78: had not said it at all. "You'll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt
LINE 79: you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without
LINE 80: me!"
LINE 81: As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me
LINE 82: over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and
LINE 83: calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the
LINE 84: grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his
LINE 85: right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with
LINE 86: his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.
LINE 87: My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,
LINE 88: that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
LINE 89: and fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and
LINE 90: sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she
LINE 91: took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,
LINE 92: in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—using
LINE 93: both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and
LINE 94: moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a
LINE 95: final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very
LINE 96: thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the
LINE 97: loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.
LINE 98: On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.
LINE 99: I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful
LINE 100: acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew
LINE 101: Mrs. Joe's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my
LINE 102: larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.
LINE 103: Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of
LINE 104: my trousers.
LINE 105: The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I
LINE 106: found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap
LINE 107: from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.
LINE 108: And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our
LINE 109: already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his
LINE 110: good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare
LINE 111: the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each
LINE 112: other's admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.
LINE 113: To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast
LINE 114: diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he
LINE 115: found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my
LINE 116: untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately
LINE 117: considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had
LINE 118: best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
LINE 119: circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at
LINE 120: me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.
LINE 121: Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
LINE 122: of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he
LINE 123: didn't seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than
LINE 124: usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like
LINE 125: a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on
LINE 126: one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw
LINE 127: that my bread and butter was gone.
LINE 128: The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of
LINE 129: his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister's
LINE 130: observation.
LINE 131: "What's the matter _now_?" said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.
LINE 132: "I say, you know!" muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious
LINE 133: remonstrance. "Pip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll
LINE 134: stick somewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip."
LINE 135: "What's the matter now?" repeated my sister, more sharply than before.
LINE 136: "If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do
LINE 137: it," said Joe, all aghast. "Manners is manners, but still your elth's
LINE 138: your elth."
LINE 139: By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,
LINE 140: and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little
LINE 141: while against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking
LINE 142: guiltily on.
LINE 143: "Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter," said my sister, out of
LINE 144: breath, "you staring great stuck pig."
LINE 145: Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and
LINE 146: looked at me again.
LINE 147: "You know, Pip," said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,
LINE 148: and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,
LINE 149: "you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you,
LINE 150: any time. But such a—" he moved his chair and looked about the floor
LINE 151: between us, and then again at me—"such a most oncommon Bolt as that!"
LINE 152: "Been bolting his food, has he?" cried my sister.
LINE 153: "You know, old chap," said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,
LINE 154: with his bite still in his cheek, "I Bolted, myself, when I was your
LINE 155: age—frequent—and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never
LINE 156: see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted
LINE 157: dead."
LINE 158: My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying
LINE 159: nothing more than the awful words, "You come along and be dosed."
LINE 160: Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine
LINE 161: medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;
LINE 162: having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the
LINE 163: best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a
LINE 164: choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like
LINE 165: a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded
LINE 166: a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater
LINE 167: comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be
LINE 168: held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to
LINE 169: swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and
LINE 170: meditating before the fire), "because he had had a turn." Judging from
LINE 171: myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had
LINE 172: none before.
LINE 173: Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in
LINE 174: the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret
LINE 175: burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great
LINE 176: punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I
LINE 177: never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the
LINE 178: housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping
LINE 179: one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about
LINE 180: the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,
LINE 181: as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the
LINE 182: voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
LINE 183: secrecy, declaring that he couldn't and wouldn't starve until
LINE 184: to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the
LINE 185: young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his
LINE 186: hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should
LINE 187: mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and
LINE 188: liver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody's hair stood on
LINE 189: end with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody's
LINE 190: ever did?
LINE 191: It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with
LINE 192: a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with
LINE 193: the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the
LINE 194: load on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the
LINE 195: bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped
LINE 196: away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.
LINE 197: "Hark!" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final
LINE 198: warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; "was that great
LINE 199: guns, Joe?"
LINE 200: "Ah!" said Joe. "There's another conwict off."
LINE 201: "What does that mean, Joe?" said I.
LINE 202: Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,
LINE 203: "Escaped. Escaped." Administering the definition like Tar-water.
LINE 204: While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my
LINE 205: mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, "What's a convict?" Joe put
LINE 206: _his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,
LINE 207: that I could make out nothing of it but the single word "Pip."
LINE 208: "There was a conwict off last night," said Joe, aloud, "after
LINE 209: sunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they're
LINE 210: firing warning of another."
LINE 211: "_Who's_ firing?" said I.
LINE 212: "Drat that boy," interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,
LINE 213: "what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you'll be told no
LINE 214: lies."
LINE 215: It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be
LINE 216: told lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite
LINE 217: unless there was company.
LINE 218: At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
LINE 219: pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a
LINE 220: word that looked to me like "sulks." Therefore, I naturally pointed to
LINE 221: Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, "her?" But Joe
LINE 222: wouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,
LINE 223: and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make
LINE 224: nothing of the word.
LINE 225: "Mrs. Joe," said I, as a last resort, "I should like to know—if you
LINE 226: wouldn't much mind—where the firing comes from?"
LINE 227: "Lord bless the boy!" exclaimed my sister, as if she didn't quite mean
LINE 228: that but rather the contrary. "From the Hulks!"
LINE 229: "Oh-h!" said I, looking at Joe. "Hulks!"
LINE 230: Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, "Well, I told you so."
LINE 231: "And please, what's Hulks?" said I.
LINE 232: "That's the way with this boy!" exclaimed my sister, pointing me out
LINE 233: with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. "Answer him one
LINE 234: question, and he'll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,
LINE 235: right 'cross th' meshes." We always used that name for marshes, in our
LINE 236: country.
LINE 237: "I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?" said
LINE 238: I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.
LINE 239: It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. "I tell you what,
LINE 240: young fellow," said she, "I didn't bring you up by hand to badger
LINE 241: people's lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.
LINE 242: People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,
LINE 243: and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking
LINE 244: questions. Now, you get along to bed!"
LINE 245: I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went
LINE 246: upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe's thimble
LINE 247: having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—I
LINE 248: felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
LINE 249: handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking
LINE 250: questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.
LINE 251: Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought
LINE 252: that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.
LINE 253: No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in
LINE 254: mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in
LINE 255: mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal
LINE 256: terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had
LINE 257: no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me
LINE 258: at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on
LINE 259: requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.
LINE 260: If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting
LINE 261: down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate
LINE 262: calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the
LINE 263: gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at
LINE 264: once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been
LINE 265: inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob
LINE 266: the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no
LINE 267: getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have
LINE 268: struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very
LINE 269: pirate himself rattling his chains.
LINE 270: As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was
LINE 271: shot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,
LINE 272: and every crack in every board calling after me, "Stop thief!" and "Get
LINE 273: up, Mrs. Joe!" In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied
LINE 274: than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare
LINE 275: hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back
LINE 276: was half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for
LINE 277: selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole
LINE 278: some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I
LINE 279: tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice), some
LINE 280: brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had
LINE 281: secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,
LINE 282: Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from
LINE 283: a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and
LINE 284: a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the
LINE 285: pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that
LINE 286: was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,
LINE 287: and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not
LINE 288: intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.
LINE 289: There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I
LINE 290: unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.
LINE 291: Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which
LINE 292: I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the
LINE 293: misty marshes.
