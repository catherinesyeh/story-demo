LINE 1: Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,
LINE 2: and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay
LINE 3: heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened
LINE 4: between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a
LINE 5: misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and
LINE 6: that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or
LINE 7: clean gone.
LINE 8: Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our
LINE 9: approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After
LINE 10: breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
LINE 11: parlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With
LINE 12: all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,
LINE 13: and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the
LINE 14: rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.
LINE 15: After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off
LINE 16: the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I
LINE 17: felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion
LINE 18: for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after
LINE 19: Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the
LINE 20: low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them
LINE 21: one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner
LINE 22: of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of
LINE 23: condescension, upon everybody in the village.
LINE 24: If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my
LINE 25: companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among
LINE 26: those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place
LINE 27: recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and
LINE 28: badge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he
LINE 29: had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to
LINE 30: me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.
LINE 31: No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these
LINE 32: grazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a
LINE 33: more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might
LINE 34: stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
LINE 35: expectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,
LINE 36: henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in
LINE 37: general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,
LINE 38: lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham
LINE 39: intended me for Estella, fell asleep.
LINE 40: When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,
LINE 41: smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
LINE 42: eyes, and said,—
LINE 43: "As being the last time, Pip, I thought I'd foller."
LINE 44: "And Joe, I am very glad you did so."
LINE 45: "Thankee, Pip."
LINE 46: "You may be sure, dear Joe," I went on, after we had shaken hands,
LINE 47: "that I shall never forget you."
LINE 48: "No, no, Pip!" said Joe, in a comfortable tone, "_I_'m sure of that.
LINE 49: Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well
LINE 50: round in a man's mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time
LINE 51: to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn't it?"
LINE 52: Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe's being so mightily secure of
LINE 53: me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,
LINE 54: "It does you credit, Pip," or something of that sort. Therefore, I made
LINE 55: no remark on Joe's first head; merely saying as to his second, that the
LINE 56: tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a
LINE 57: gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I
LINE 58: were one.
LINE 59: "Have you though?" said Joe. "Astonishing!"
LINE 60: "It's a pity now, Joe," said I, "that you did not get on a little more,
LINE 61: when we had our lessons here; isn't it?"
LINE 62: "Well, I don't know," returned Joe. "I'm so awful dull. I'm only master
LINE 63: of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it's
LINE 64: no more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don't you see?"
LINE 65: What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to
LINE 66: do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had
LINE 67: been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly
LINE 68: innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to
LINE 69: Biddy in preference.
LINE 70: So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our
LINE 71: little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a
LINE 72: general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never
LINE 73: forget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.
LINE 74: "And it is, Biddy," said I, "that you will not omit any opportunity of
LINE 75: helping Joe on, a little."
LINE 76: "How helping him on?" asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.
LINE 77: "Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think he is the dearest
LINE 78: fellow that ever lived,—but he is rather backward in some things. For
LINE 79: instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners."
LINE 80: Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her
LINE 81: eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.
LINE 82: "O, his manners! won't his manners do then?" asked Biddy, plucking a
LINE 83: black-currant leaf.
LINE 84: "My dear Biddy, they do very well here—"
LINE 85: "O! they _do_ very well here?" interrupted Biddy, looking closely at
LINE 86: the leaf in her hand.
LINE 87: "Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I
LINE 88: shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would
LINE 89: hardly do him justice."
LINE 90: "And don't you think he knows that?" asked Biddy.
LINE 91: It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most
LINE 92: distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—
LINE 93: "Biddy, what do you mean?"
LINE 94: Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the
LINE 95: smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that
LINE 96: evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, "Have you
LINE 97: never considered that he may be proud?"
LINE 98: "Proud?" I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.
LINE 99: "O! there are many kinds of pride," said Biddy, looking full at me and
LINE 100: shaking her head; "pride is not all of one kind—"
LINE 101: "Well? What are you stopping for?" said I.
LINE 102: "Not all of one kind," resumed Biddy. "He may be too proud to let any
LINE 103: one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills
LINE 104: well and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it
LINE 105: sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I
LINE 106: do."
LINE 107: "Now, Biddy," said I, "I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not
LINE 108: expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You
LINE 109: are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help
LINE 110: showing it."
LINE 111: "If you have the heart to think so," returned Biddy, "say so. Say so
LINE 112: over and over again, if you have the heart to think so."
LINE 113: "If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy," said I, in a
LINE 114: virtuous and superior tone; "don't put it off upon me. I am very sorry
LINE 115: to see it, and it's a—it's a bad side of human nature. I did intend to
LINE 116: ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was
LINE 117: gone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am
LINE 118: extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy," I repeated. "It's a—it's a
LINE 119: bad side of human nature."
LINE 120: "Whether you scold me or approve of me," returned poor Biddy, "you may
LINE 121: equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at
LINE 122: all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no
LINE 123: difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be
LINE 124: unjust neither," said Biddy, turning away her head.
LINE 125: I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in
LINE 126: which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to
LINE 127: think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,
LINE 128: and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and
LINE 129: took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very
LINE 130: sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright
LINE 131: fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.
LINE 132: But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency
LINE 133: to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I
LINE 134: had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,
LINE 135: and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his
LINE 136: breakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think it
LINE 137: worth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.
LINE 138: "Well!" said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. "How are
LINE 139: you, and what can I do for you?"
LINE 140: Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was
LINE 141: slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a
LINE 142: prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous
LINE 143: little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let
LINE 144: into the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that
LINE 145: heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.
LINE 146: "Mr. Trabb," said I, "it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention,
LINE 147: because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome
LINE 148: property."
LINE 149: A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up
LINE 150: from the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,
LINE 151: "Lord bless my soul!"
LINE 152: "I am going up to my guardian in London," said I, casually drawing some
LINE 153: guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; "and I want a fashionable
LINE 154: suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them," I added—otherwise I
LINE 155: thought he might only pretend to make them, "with ready money."
LINE 156: "My dear sir," said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened
LINE 157: his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
LINE 158: elbow, "don't hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate
LINE 159: you? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?"
LINE 160: Mr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.
LINE 161: When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his
LINE 162: labours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into
LINE 163: the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible
LINE 164: corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with
LINE 165: any blacksmith, alive or dead.
LINE 166: "Hold that noise," said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, "or
LINE 167: I'll knock your head off!—Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,
LINE 168: this," said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out
LINE 169: in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand
LINE 170: under it to show the gloss, "is a very sweet article. I can recommend
LINE 171: it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you
LINE 172: shall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!" (To the boy, and with
LINE 173: a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's
LINE 174: brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)
LINE 175: Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
LINE 176: deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.
LINE 177: Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. "And let
LINE 178: me have none of your tricks here," said Mr. Trabb, "or you shall repent
LINE 179: it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live."
LINE 180: Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential
LINE 181: confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an
LINE 182: article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it
LINE 183: would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished
LINE 184: fellow-townsman's (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having
LINE 185: worn. "Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond," said Mr.
LINE 186: Trabb to the boy after that, "or shall I kick you out of the shop and
LINE 187: bring them myself?"
LINE 188: I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's
LINE 189: judgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.
LINE 190: Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented
LINE 191: with it, he said apologetically that it "wouldn't do under existing
LINE 192: circumstances, sir,—wouldn't do at all." So, Mr. Trabb measured and
LINE 193: calculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest
LINE 194: species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I
LINE 195: felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his
LINE 196: pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
LINE 197: to Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand
LINE 198: upon the parlour lock, "I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be
LINE 199: expected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a
LINE 200: turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem
LINE 201: it. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!"
LINE 202: The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what
LINE 203: it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his
LINE 204: hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
LINE 205: was, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb's boy.
LINE 206: After this memorable event, I went to the hatter's, and the
LINE 207: bootmaker's, and the hosier's, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard's
LINE 208: dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went
LINE 209: to the coach-office and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday
LINE 210: morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come
LINE 211: into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,
LINE 212: it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention
LINE 213: diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his
LINE 214: mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my
LINE 215: steps towards Pumblechook's, and, as I approached that gentleman's
LINE 216: place of business, I saw him standing at his door.
LINE 217: He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with
LINE 218: the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had
LINE 219: prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too ordered
LINE 220: his shopman to "come out of the gangway" as my sacred person passed.
LINE 221: "My dear friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when
LINE 222: he and I and the collation were alone, "I give you joy of your good
LINE 223: fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!"
LINE 224: This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of
LINE 225: expressing himself.
LINE 226: "To think," said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for
LINE 227: some moments, "that I should have been the humble instrument of leading
LINE 228: up to this, is a proud reward."
LINE 229: I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said
LINE 230: or hinted, on that point.
LINE 231: "My dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook; "if you will allow me to
LINE 232: call you so—"
LINE 233: I murmured "Certainly," and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands
LINE 234: again, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an
LINE 235: emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, "My dear young
LINE 236: friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping
LINE 237: the fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!" said Mr. Pumblechook, in
LINE 238: the way of a compassionate adjuration. "Joseph!! Joseph!!!" Thereupon
LINE 239: he shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in
LINE 240: Joseph.
LINE 241: "But my dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, "you must be hungry,
LINE 242: you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the
LINE 243: Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here's one or two
LINE 244: little things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.
LINE 245: But do I," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he
LINE 246: had sat down, "see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of
LINE 247: happy infancy? And may I—_may_ I—?"
LINE 248: This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was
LINE 249: fervent, and then sat down again.
LINE 250: "Here is wine," said Mr. Pumblechook. "Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,
LINE 251: and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet I
LINE 252: cannot," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, "see afore me One—and
LINE 253: likewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—_may_ I—?"
LINE 254: I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his
LINE 255: glass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned
LINE 256: myself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more
LINE 257: direct to my head.
LINE 258: Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of
LINE 259: tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and
LINE 260: took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. "Ah! poultry,
LINE 261: poultry! You little thought," said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the
LINE 262: fowl in the dish, "when you was a young fledgling, what was in store
LINE 263: for you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this
LINE 264: humble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will," said Mr.
LINE 265: Pumblechook, getting up again, "but may I? _may_ I—?"
LINE 266: It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he
LINE 267: did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself
LINE 268: with my knife, I don't know.
LINE 269: "And your sister," he resumed, after a little steady eating, "which had
LINE 270: the honour of bringing you up by hand! It's a sad picter, to reflect
LINE 271: that she's no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May—"
LINE 272: I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.
LINE 273: "We'll drink her health," said I.
LINE 274: "Ah!" cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid
LINE 275: with admiration, "that's the way you know 'em, sir!" (I don't know who
LINE 276: Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person
LINE 277: present); "that's the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever
LINE 278: forgiving and ever affable. It might," said the servile Pumblechook,
LINE 279: putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, "to a
LINE 280: common person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?"
LINE 281: When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. "Let
LINE 282: us never be blind," said Mr. Pumblechook, "to her faults of temper, but
LINE 283: it is to be hoped she meant well."
LINE 284: At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in
LINE 285: the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.
LINE 286: I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes
LINE 287: sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I
LINE 288: mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,
LINE 289: and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he
LINE 290: intimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he? Then he
LINE 291: asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we
LINE 292: had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he
LINE 293: had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken
LINE 294: ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he
LINE 295: never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of
LINE 296: hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling
LINE 297: convinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a
LINE 298: sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.
LINE 299: By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask
LINE 300: my advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was
LINE 301: an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and
LINE 302: seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred
LINE 303: before in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to
LINE 304: the realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.
LINE 305: Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him
LINE 306: (Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through
LINE 307: a sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to
LINE 308: do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the
LINE 309: books,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his
LINE 310: pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that that
LINE 311: might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
LINE 312: property, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?
LINE 313: He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it
LINE 314: as my opinion. "Wait a bit!" The united vastness and distinctness of
LINE 315: this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake
LINE 316: hands with me, but said he really must,—and did.
LINE 317: We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and
LINE 318: over again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don't know what mark), and
LINE 319: to render me efficient and constant service (I don't know what
LINE 320: service). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and
LINE 321: certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had
LINE 322: always said of me, "That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun'
LINE 323: will be no common fortun'." He said with a tearful smile that it was a
LINE 324: singular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out
LINE 325: into the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted
LINE 326: in the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got
LINE 327: to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.
LINE 328: There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He was a long way
LINE 329: down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to
LINE 330: stop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.
LINE 331: "No, my dear friend," said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.
LINE 332: "Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without
LINE 333: that affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?
LINE 334: _May_ I?"
LINE 335: We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young
LINE 336: carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me
LINE 337: and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the
LINE 338: road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
LINE 339: before I pursued my way home.
LINE 340: I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little
LINE 341: I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that
LINE 342: same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want
LINE 343: next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.
LINE 344: So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I
LINE 345: went to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
LINE 346: Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress
LINE 347: in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My
LINE 348: clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and
LINE 349: eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a
LINE 350: trifle short of the wearer's expectation. But after I had had my new
LINE 351: suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of
LINE 352: posturing with Mr. Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the
LINE 353: futile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being
LINE 354: market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.
LINE 355: Pumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to
LINE 356: leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before
LINE 357: departing. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new
LINE 358: array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious
LINE 359: after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe's
LINE 360: in his Sunday suit.
LINE 361: I went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang
LINE 362: at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my
LINE 363: gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when
LINE 364: she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned
LINE 365: from brown to green and yellow.
LINE 366: "You?" said she. "You? Good gracious! What do you want?"
LINE 367: "I am going to London, Miss Pocket," said I, "and want to say good-bye
LINE 368: to Miss Havisham."
LINE 369: I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went
LINE 370: to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned
LINE 371: and took me up, staring at me all the way.
LINE 372: Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
LINE 373: table, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,
LINE 374: and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then
LINE 375: just abreast of the rotted bride-cake.
LINE 376: "Don't go, Sarah," she said. "Well, Pip?"
LINE 377: "I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow," I was exceedingly
LINE 378: careful what I said, "and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking
LINE 379: leave of you."
LINE 380: "This is a gay figure, Pip," said she, making her crutch stick play
LINE 381: round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were
LINE 382: bestowing the finishing gift.
LINE 383: "I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss
LINE 384: Havisham," I murmured. "And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!"
LINE 385: "Ay, ay!" said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with
LINE 386: delight. "I have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So you
LINE 387: go to-morrow?"
LINE 388: "Yes, Miss Havisham."
LINE 389: "And you are adopted by a rich person?"
LINE 390: "Yes, Miss Havisham."
LINE 391: "Not named?"
LINE 392: "No, Miss Havisham."
LINE 393: "And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?"
LINE 394: "Yes, Miss Havisham."
LINE 395: She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her
LINE 396: enjoyment of Sarah Pocket's jealous dismay. "Well!" she went on; "you
LINE 397: have a promising career before you. Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.
LINE 398: Jaggers's instructions." She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and
LINE 399: Sarah's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.
LINE 400: "Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know."
LINE 401: "Yes, Miss Havisham."
LINE 402: "Good-bye, Pip!"
LINE 403: She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my
LINE 404: lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came
LINE 405: naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket
LINE 406: with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with
LINE 407: both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly
LINE 408: lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.
LINE 409: Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen
LINE 410: out. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree
LINE 411: confounded. I said "Good-bye, Miss Pocket;" but she merely stared, and
LINE 412: did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the
LINE 413: house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new
LINE 414: clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,
LINE 415: carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had
LINE 416: the bundle to carry.
LINE 417: And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run
LINE 418: out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more
LINE 419: steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled
LINE 420: away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more
LINE 421: appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I
LINE 422: dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my
LINE 423: splendour	 until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,
LINE 424: graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish
LINE 425: with. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in
LINE 426: spirits.
LINE 427: I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little
LINE 428: hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all
LINE 429: alone. I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense
LINE 430: of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the
LINE 431: coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of
LINE 432: this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on
LINE 433: this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had
LINE 434: an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in
LINE 435: the morning. I did not.
LINE 436: All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places
LINE 437: instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now
LINE 438: pigs, now men,—never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me
LINE 439: until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and
LINE 440: partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in
LINE 441: taking it fell asleep.
LINE 442: Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not
LINE 443: sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
LINE 444: I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the
LINE 445: afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking
LINE 446: of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go
LINE 447: downstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and
LINE 448: unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,
LINE 449: until Biddy called to me that I was late.
LINE 450: It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,
LINE 451: saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,
LINE 452: "Well! I suppose I must be off!" and then I kissed my sister who was
LINE 453: laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,
LINE 454: and threw my arms around Joe's neck. Then I took up my little
LINE 455: portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I
LINE 456: presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing
LINE 457: an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped
LINE 458: then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above
LINE 459: his head, crying huskily "Hooroar!" and Biddy put her apron to her
LINE 460: face.
LINE 461: I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had
LINE 462: supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to
LINE 463: have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High
LINE 464: Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very
LINE 465: peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to
LINE 466: show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all
LINE 467: beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave
LINE 468: and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the
LINE 469: village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, "Good-bye, O my dear,
LINE 470: dear friend!"
LINE 471: Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain
LINE 472: upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was
LINE 473: better after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my own
LINE 474: ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe
LINE 475: with me then.
LINE 476: So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the
LINE 477: course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was
LINE 478: clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would
LINE 479: not get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another
LINE 480: evening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made
LINE 481: up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite
LINE 482: practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while
LINE 483: I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact
LINE 484: resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my
LINE 485: heart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!
LINE 486: We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to
LINE 487: go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and
LINE 488: the world lay spread before me.
LINE 489: This is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations.
