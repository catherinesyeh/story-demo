LINE 1: It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and
LINE 2: the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my
LINE 3: sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That
LINE 4: the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed
LINE 5: unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my
LINE 6: thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming
LINE 7: towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the
LINE 8: door. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,
LINE 9: there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of
LINE 10: the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she
LINE 11: were still alive and had been often there.
LINE 12: Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my
LINE 13: sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret
LINE 14: which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and
LINE 15: perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized
LINE 16: with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had
LINE 17: suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have
LINE 18: revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.
LINE 19: Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that
LINE 20: I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the
LINE 21: curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the
LINE 22: morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the
LINE 23: forge.
LINE 24: It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times
LINE 25: when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,
LINE 26: vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
LINE 27: softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the
LINE 28: beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it
LINE 29: would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should
LINE 30: be softened as they thought of me.
LINE 31: At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.
LINE 32: had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally
LINE 33: absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a
LINE 34: black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any
LINE 35: comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I
LINE 36: recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young
LINE 37: couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of
LINE 38: intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped
LINE 39: round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and
LINE 40: most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed
LINE 41: windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two
LINE 42: warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too
LINE 43: much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.
LINE 44: Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a
LINE 45: wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.
LINE 46: Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves
LINE 47: up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity
LINE 48: of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished
LINE 49: putting somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;
LINE 50: so he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and
LINE 51: confused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of
LINE 52: warm affection.
LINE 53: Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
LINE 54: under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,
LINE 55: as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent
LINE 56: down and said to him, "Dear Joe, how are you?" he said, "Pip, old chap,
LINE 57: you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—" and clasped my hand
LINE 58: and said no more.
LINE 59: Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly
LINE 60: here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I
LINE 61: thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and
LINE 62: there began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.
LINE 63: The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I
LINE 64: looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible
LINE 65: until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum
LINE 66: cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and
LINE 67: biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had
LINE 68: never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.
LINE 69: Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook
LINE 70: in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately
LINE 71: stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my
LINE 72: attention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing
LINE 73: sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, "May I, dear sir?" and
LINE 74: did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent
LINE 75: speechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to "follow," and
LINE 76: were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into
LINE 77: ridiculous bundles.
LINE 78: "Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.
LINE 79: Trabb called "formed" in the parlour, two and two,—and it was
LINE 80: dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; "which I
LINE 81: meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the
LINE 82: church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it
LINE 83: with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours
LINE 84: would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in
LINE 85: respect."
LINE 86: "Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!" cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a
LINE 87: depressed business-like voice. "Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are
LINE 88: ready!"
LINE 89: So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses
LINE 90: were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and
LINE 91: Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had
LINE 92: been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of
LINE 93: Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded
LINE 94: under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole
LINE 95: looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and
LINE 96: blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and
LINE 97: his comrade.
LINE 98: The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and
LINE 99: we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful
LINE 100: and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us
LINE 101: off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such
LINE 102: times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on
LINE 103: our emergence round some corner of expectancy, "_Here_ they come!"
LINE 104: "_Here_ they are!" and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was
LINE 105: much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted
LINE 106: all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,
LINE 107: and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the
LINE 108: excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited
LINE 109: and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.
LINE 110: And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the
LINE 111: ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,
LINE 112: close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this
LINE 113: parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was
LINE 114: laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the
LINE 115: light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.
LINE 116: Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,
LINE 117: I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even
LINE 118: when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it
LINE 119: brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it
LINE 120: fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him
LINE 121: cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came
LINE 122: unexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had the
LINE 123: hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had
LINE 124: done her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it
LINE 125: reasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank
LINE 126: all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two
LINE 127: talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as
LINE 128: if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were
LINE 129: notoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.
LINE 130: Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly
LINE 131: Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest
LINE 132: benefactor.
LINE 133: When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his Boy; I
LINE 134: looked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,
LINE 135: the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a
LINE 136: cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old
LINE 137: kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his
LINE 138: knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great
LINE 139: restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and
LINE 140: when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down
LINE 141: together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I
LINE 142: noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to
LINE 143: make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which
LINE 144: the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.
LINE 145: He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little
LINE 146: room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great
LINE 147: thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing
LINE 148: in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a
LINE 149: little talk.
LINE 150: "Biddy," said I, "I think you might have written to me about these sad
LINE 151: matters."
LINE 152: "Do you, Mr. Pip?" said Biddy. "I should have written if I had thought
LINE 153: that."
LINE 154: "Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider
LINE 155: that you ought to have thought that."
LINE 156: "Do you, Mr. Pip?"
LINE 157: She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with
LINE 158: her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After
LINE 159: looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave
LINE 160: up that point.
LINE 161: "I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy
LINE 162: dear?"
LINE 163: "Oh! I can't do so, Mr. Pip," said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still
LINE 164: of quiet conviction. "I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am
LINE 165: going to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of
LINE 166: Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down."
LINE 167: "How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—"
LINE 168: "How am I going to live?" repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary
LINE 169: flush upon her face. "I'll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get
LINE 170: the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be
LINE 171: well recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious
LINE 172: and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,"
LINE 173: pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, "the
LINE 174: new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you
LINE 175: after that time, and have had time since then to improve."
LINE 176: "I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances."
LINE 177: "Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature," murmured Biddy.
LINE 178: It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!
LINE 179: I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further
LINE 180: with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.
LINE 181: "I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy."
LINE 182: "They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad
LINE 183: states—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four
LINE 184: days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and
LINE 185: said quite plainly, 'Joe.' As she had never said any word for a long
LINE 186: while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs
LINE 187: to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to
LINE 188: put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid
LINE 189: her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she
LINE 190: presently said 'Joe' again, and once 'Pardon,' and once 'Pip.' And so
LINE 191: she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later
LINE 192: when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone."
LINE 193: Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that
LINE 194: were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.
LINE 195: "Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?"
LINE 196: "Nothing."
LINE 197: "Do you know what is become of Orlick?"
LINE 198: "I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in
LINE 199: the quarries."
LINE 200: "Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark
LINE 201: tree in the lane?"
LINE 202: "I saw him there, on the night she died."
LINE 203: "That was not the last time either, Biddy?"
LINE 204: "No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of
LINE 205: no use," said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running
LINE 206: out, "you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and
LINE 207: he is gone."
LINE 208: It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by
LINE 209: this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told
LINE 210: her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of
LINE 211: that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she
LINE 212: told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,—she
LINE 213: didn't say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,—but ever did
LINE 214: his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a
LINE 215: gentle heart.
LINE 216: "Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him," said I; "and Biddy,
LINE 217: we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often
LINE 218: down here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone."
LINE 219: Biddy said never a single word.
LINE 220: "Biddy, don't you hear me?"
LINE 221: "Yes, Mr. Pip."
LINE 222: "Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be in
LINE 223: bad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?"
LINE 224: "What do I mean?" asked Biddy, timidly.
LINE 225: "Biddy," said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, "I must request
LINE 226: to know what you mean by this?"
LINE 227: "By this?" said Biddy.
LINE 228: "Now, don't echo," I retorted. "You used not to echo, Biddy."
LINE 229: "Used not!" said Biddy. "O Mr. Pip! Used!"
LINE 230: Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another
LINE 231: silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.
LINE 232: "Biddy," said I, "I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,
LINE 233: to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the
LINE 234: goodness, Biddy, to tell me why."
LINE 235: "Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?" asked
LINE 236: Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the
LINE 237: stars with a clear and honest eye.
LINE 238: "O dear me!" said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in
LINE 239: despair. "This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any
LINE 240: more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much."
LINE 241: For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and
LINE 242: when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of
LINE 243: her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the
LINE 244: churchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the
LINE 245: night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an
LINE 246: unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.
LINE 247: Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and
LINE 248: looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I
LINE 249: stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of
LINE 250: health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright
LINE 251: sun of the life in store for him were shining on it.
LINE 252: "Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don't wipe it off—for God's sake, give me your
LINE 253: blackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often."
LINE 254: [Illustration]
LINE 255: "Never too soon, sir," said Joe, "and never too often, Pip!"
LINE 256: Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk
LINE 257: and a crust of bread. "Biddy," said I, when I gave her my hand at
LINE 258: parting, "I am not angry, but I am hurt."
LINE 259: "No, don't be hurt," she pleaded quite pathetically; "let only me be
LINE 260: hurt, if I have been ungenerous."
LINE 261: Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to
LINE 262: me, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and that
LINE 263: Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.
