LINE 1: What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving
LINE 2: Estella's parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the
LINE 3: question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
LINE 4: me by a wiser head than my own.
LINE 5: But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was
LINE 6: seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter
LINE 7: down,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.
LINE 8: Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I
LINE 9: felt that I did this for Estella's sake, or whether I was glad to
LINE 10: transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some
LINE 11: rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps
LINE 12: the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.
LINE 13: Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street
LINE 14: that night. Herbert's representations that, if I did, I should probably
LINE 15: be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would
LINE 16: depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,
LINE 17: again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.
LINE 18: Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my
LINE 19: hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out
LINE 20: together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left
LINE 21: Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.
LINE 22: There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over
LINE 23: the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things
LINE 24: straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into
LINE 25: Mr. Jaggers's room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the
LINE 26: outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew
LINE 27: what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick
LINE 28: together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to
LINE 29: compromise him.
LINE 30: My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my
LINE 31: shoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief
LINE 32: account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to
LINE 33: give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused
LINE 34: our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the
LINE 35: rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the
LINE 36: disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.
LINE 37: Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the
LINE 38: pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.
LINE 39: The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official
LINE 40: proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn't
LINE 41: smell fire at the present moment.
LINE 42: My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced
LINE 43: Miss Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
LINE 44: Herbert. Mr. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his head when
LINE 45: I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,
LINE 46: with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was
LINE 47: in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.
LINE 48: Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked
LINE 49: on at me. "I am sorry, Pip," said he, as I put the check in my pocket,
LINE 50: when he had signed it, "that we do nothing for _you_."
LINE 51: "Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me," I returned, "whether she
LINE 52: could do nothing for me, and I told her No."
LINE 53: "Everybody should know his own business," said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw
LINE 54: Wemmick's lips form the words "portable property."
LINE 55: "I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you," said Mr Jaggers;
LINE 56: "but every man ought to know his own business best."
LINE 57: "Every man's business," said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,
LINE 58: "is portable property."
LINE 59: As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at
LINE 60: heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—
LINE 61: "I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to
LINE 62: give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave
LINE 63: me all she possessed."
LINE 64: "Did she?" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and
LINE 65: then straightening himself. "Hah! I don't think I should have done so,
LINE 66: if I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own business
LINE 67: best."
LINE 68: "I know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child than Miss
LINE 69: Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother."
LINE 70: Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated "Mother?"
LINE 71: "I have seen her mother within these three days."
LINE 72: "Yes?" said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 73: "And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently."
LINE 74: "Yes?" said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 75: "Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do," said I. "I
LINE 76: know her father too."
LINE 77: A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was too
LINE 78: self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being
LINE 79: brought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did not
LINE 80: know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis's
LINE 81: account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;
LINE 82: which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers's
LINE 83: client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason
LINE 84: for claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this
LINE 85: unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure
LINE 86: of it now.
LINE 87: "So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?" said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 88: "Yes," I replied, "and his name is Provis—from New South Wales."
LINE 89: Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest
LINE 90: start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the
LINE 91: sooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the
LINE 92: action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the
LINE 93: announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just
LINE 94: then, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been
LINE 95: some communication unknown to him between us.
LINE 96: "And on what evidence, Pip," asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he
LINE 97: paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, "does Provis make
LINE 98: this claim?"
LINE 99: "He does not make it," said I, "and has never made it, and has no
LINE 100: knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence."
LINE 101: For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so
LINE 102: unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
LINE 103: without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked
LINE 104: with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.
LINE 105: Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation
LINE 106: that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact
LINE 107: knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look
LINE 108: towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been
LINE 109: for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers's look. When I did at last
LINE 110: turn my eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that he had unposted his
LINE 111: pen, and was intent upon the table before him.
LINE 112: "Hah!" said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the
LINE 113: table. "What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?"
LINE 114: But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a
LINE 115: passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and
LINE 116: manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had
LINE 117: lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had
LINE 118: made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I
LINE 119: represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence
LINE 120: from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said
LINE 121: that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted
LINE 122: assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,
LINE 123: and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he
LINE 124: cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,
LINE 125: and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,
LINE 126: whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
LINE 127: else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and
LINE 128: silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to
LINE 129: Wemmick, and said, "Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle
LINE 130: heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the
LINE 131: innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
LINE 132: life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to
LINE 133: represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be
LINE 134: more open with me!"
LINE 135: I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.
LINE 136: Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving
LINE 137: crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
LINE 138: employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something
LINE 139: like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.
LINE 140: "What's all this?" said Mr. Jaggers. "You with an old father, and you
LINE 141: with pleasant and playful ways?"
LINE 142: "Well!" returned Wemmick. "If I don't bring 'em here, what does it
LINE 143: matter?"
LINE 144: "Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling
LINE 145: openly, "this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London."
LINE 146: "Not a bit of it," returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. "I
LINE 147: think you're another."
LINE 148: Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still
LINE 149: distrustful that the other was taking him in.
LINE 150: "_You_ with a pleasant home?" said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 151: "Since it don't interfere with business," returned Wemmick, "let it be
LINE 152: so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if _you_ might be
LINE 153: planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of
LINE 154: these days, when you're tired of all this work."
LINE 155: Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and
LINE 156: actually drew a sigh. "Pip," said he, "we won't talk about 'poor
LINE 157: dreams;' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher
LINE 158: experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I'll put a
LINE 159: case to you. Mind! I admit nothing."
LINE 160: He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly
LINE 161: said that he admitted nothing.
LINE 162: "Now, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "put this case. Put the case that a
LINE 163: woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child
LINE 164: concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal
LINE 165: adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to
LINE 166: the latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put
LINE 167: the case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
LINE 168: eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up."
LINE 169: "I follow you, sir."
LINE 170: "Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he
LINE 171: saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain
LINE 172: destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at
LINE 173: a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that
LINE 174: he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,
LINE 175: neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing
LINE 176: up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw
LINE 177: in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,
LINE 178: to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to be
LINE 179: prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow."
LINE 180: "I follow you, sir."
LINE 181: "Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the
LINE 182: heap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make
LINE 183: no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this
LINE 184: power: "I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,
LINE 185: you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you
LINE 186: through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it
LINE 187: should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be
LINE 188: produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring
LINE 189: you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,
LINE 190: your child is still saved." Put the case that this was done, and that
LINE 191: the woman was cleared."
LINE 192: "I understand you perfectly."
LINE 193: "But that I make no admissions?"
LINE 194: "That you make no admissions." And Wemmick repeated, "No admissions."
LINE 195: "Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little
LINE 196: shaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,
LINE 197: she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be
LINE 198: sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the
LINE 199: old, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking
LINE 200: out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend
LINE 201: the imaginary case?"
LINE 202: "Quite."
LINE 203: "Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That
LINE 204: the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the
LINE 205: mother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many
LINE 206: miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was
LINE 207: still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case
LINE 208: to yourself very carefully."
LINE 209: "I do."
LINE 210: "I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully."
LINE 211: And Wemmick said, "I do."
LINE 212: "For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think
LINE 213: he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I
LINE 214: think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For
LINE 215: the daughter's? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her
LINE 216: parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to
LINE 217: disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for
LINE 218: life. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her
LINE 219: the subject of those 'poor dreams' which have, at one time or another,
LINE 220: been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you
LINE 221: that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of
LINE 222: it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right
LINE 223: hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off
LINE 224: too."
LINE 225: I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his
LINE 226: lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.
LINE 227: "Now, Wemmick," said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, "what
LINE 228: item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?"
LINE 229: Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the
LINE 230: odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:
LINE 231: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to
LINE 232: say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional
LINE 233: light to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now
LINE 234: inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and
LINE 235: Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest
LINE 236: point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill
LINE 237: terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.
LINE 238: But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of
LINE 239: Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on
LINE 240: his sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance
LINE 241: within those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or
LINE 242: in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble
LINE 243: (which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest
LINE 244: daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this
LINE 245: melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially
LINE 246: before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye
LINE 247: happened to twinkle with a tear.
LINE 248: "What are you about?" demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.
LINE 249: "What do you come snivelling here for?"
LINE 250: "I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick."
LINE 251: "You did," said Wemmick. "How dare you? You're not in a fit state to
LINE 252: come here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen.
LINE 253: What do you mean by it?"
LINE 254: "A man can't help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick," pleaded Mike.
LINE 255: "His what?" demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. "Say that again!"
LINE 256: "Now look here my man," said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and
LINE 257: pointing to the door. "Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings
LINE 258: here. Get out."
LINE 259: "It serves you right," said Wemmick, "Get out."
LINE 260: So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and
LINE 261: Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and
LINE 262: went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had
LINE 263: just had lunch.
