LINE 1: The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,
LINE 2: that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to
LINE 3: get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous
LINE 4: conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's
LINE 5: great-aunt's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to
LINE 6: get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she
LINE 7: would impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging
LINE 8: of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her
LINE 9: promise within five minutes.
LINE 10: The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt
LINE 11: may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and
LINE 12: put straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt
LINE 13: collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
LINE 14: a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,
LINE 15: the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand
LINE 16: to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a
LINE 17: little spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this
LINE 18: volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of
LINE 19: coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils
LINE 20: then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the
LINE 21: subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the
LINE 22: hardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a
LINE 23: rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they
LINE 24: had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more
LINE 25: illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have
LINE 26: since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various
LINE 27: specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part
LINE 28: of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between
LINE 29: Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave
LINE 30: out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—or
LINE 31: what we couldn't—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,
LINE 32: shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or
LINE 33: reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had
LINE 34: lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt,
LINE 35: who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was
LINE 36: understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into
LINE 37: the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that
LINE 38: there was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with
LINE 39: a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not
LINE 40: easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of
LINE 41: the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was
LINE 42: also Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber—being but
LINE 43: faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle
LINE 44: and no snuffers.
LINE 45: It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under
LINE 46: these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very
LINE 47: evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some
LINE 48: information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of
LINE 49: moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D
LINE 50: which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I
LINE 51: supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.
LINE 52: Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe
LINE 53: liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders
LINE 54: from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that
LINE 55: evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the
LINE 56: Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.
LINE 57: There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk
LINE 58: scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to
LINE 59: be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and
LINE 60: had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our
LINE 61: country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
LINE 62: to account.
LINE 63: It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at
LINE 64: these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I
LINE 65: merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the
LINE 66: end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and
LINE 67: where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a
LINE 68: stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with "Halloa, Pip, old chap!" and the
LINE 69: moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.
LINE 70: He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was
LINE 71: all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were
LINE 72: taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his
LINE 73: mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away
LINE 74: and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he
LINE 75: nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit
LINE 76: down there.
LINE 77: But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of
LINE 78: resort, I said "No, thank you, sir," and fell into the space Joe made
LINE 79: for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,
LINE 80: and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again
LINE 81: when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as
LINE 82: it struck me.
LINE 83: "You was saying," said the strange man, turning to Joe, "that you was a
LINE 84: blacksmith."
LINE 85: "Yes. I said it, you know," said Joe.
LINE 86: "What'll you drink, Mr.—? You didn't mention your name, by the bye."
LINE 87: Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. "What'll
LINE 88: you drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?"
LINE 89: "Well," said Joe, "to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of
LINE 90: drinking at anybody's expense but my own."
LINE 91: "Habit? No," returned the stranger, "but once and away, and on a
LINE 92: Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery."
LINE 93: "I wouldn't wish to be stiff company," said Joe. "Rum."
LINE 94: "Rum," repeated the stranger. "And will the other gentleman originate a
LINE 95: sentiment."
LINE 96: "Rum," said Mr. Wopsle.
LINE 97: "Three Rums!" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. "Glasses
LINE 98: round!"
LINE 99: "This other gentleman," observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,
LINE 100: "is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at
LINE 101: church."
LINE 102: "Aha!" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. "The
LINE 103: lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!"
LINE 104: "That's it," said Joe.
LINE 105: The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his
LINE 106: legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping
LINE 107: broad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over
LINE 108: his head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he
LINE 109: looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a
LINE 110: half-laugh, come into his face.
LINE 111: "I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a
LINE 112: solitary country towards the river."
LINE 113: "Most marshes is solitary," said Joe.
LINE 114: "No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or
LINE 115: vagrants of any sort, out there?"
LINE 116: "No," said Joe; "none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't
LINE 117: find _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?"
LINE 118: Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;
LINE 119: but not warmly.
LINE 120: "Seems you have been out after such?" asked the stranger.
LINE 121: "Once," returned Joe. "Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;
LINE 122: we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn't us,
LINE 123: Pip?"
LINE 124: "Yes, Joe."
LINE 125: The stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he were
LINE 126: expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, "He's a
LINE 127: likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?"
LINE 128: "Pip," said Joe.
LINE 129: "Christened Pip?"
LINE 130: "No, not christened Pip."
LINE 131: "Surname Pip?"
LINE 132: "No," said Joe, "it's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
LINE 133: infant, and is called by."
LINE 134: "Son of yours?"
LINE 135: "Well," said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in
LINE 136: anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at
LINE 137: the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
LINE 138: discussed over pipes,—"well—no. No, he ain't."
LINE 139: "Nevvy?" said the strange man.
LINE 140: "Well," said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, "he
LINE 141: is not—no, not to deceive you, he is _not_—my nevvy."
LINE 142: "What the Blue Blazes is he?" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me
LINE 143: to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.
LINE 144: Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about
LINE 145: relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female
LINE 146: relations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and
LINE 147: Joe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most
LINE 148: terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to
LINE 149: think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, "—as
LINE 150: the poet says."
LINE 151: And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he
LINE 152: considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and
LINE 153: poke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing
LINE 154: who visited at our house should always have put me through the same
LINE 155: inflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to
LINE 156: mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our
LINE 157: social family circle, but some large-handed person took some such
LINE 158: ophthalmic steps to patronise me.
LINE 159: All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at
LINE 160: me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me
LINE 161: down. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,
LINE 162: until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his
LINE 163: shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.
LINE 164: It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was
LINE 165: pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at
LINE 166: me, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it
LINE 167: and he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a
LINE 168: file_.
LINE 169: He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it
LINE 170: he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe's
LINE 171: file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the
LINE 172: instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on
LINE 173: his settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally
LINE 174: about turnips.
LINE 175: There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause
LINE 176: before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,
LINE 177: which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on
LINE 178: Saturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water
LINE 179: running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.
LINE 180: "Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery," said the strange man. "I think I've
LINE 181: got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the
LINE 182: boy shall have it."
LINE 183: He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some
LINE 184: crumpled paper, and gave it to me. "Yours!" said he. "Mind! Your own."
LINE 185: I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,
LINE 186: and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.
LINE 187: Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look
LINE 188: with his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may
LINE 189: be done with an eye by hiding it.
LINE 190: On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must
LINE 191: have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of
LINE 192: the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide
LINE 193: open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a
LINE 194: manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
LINE 195: acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.
LINE 196: My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
LINE 197: the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to
LINE 198: tell her about the bright shilling. "A bad un, I'll be bound," said
LINE 199: Mrs. Joe triumphantly, "or he wouldn't have given it to the boy! Let's
LINE 200: look at it."
LINE 201: I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. "But what's
LINE 202: this?" said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the
LINE 203: paper. "Two One-Pound notes?"
LINE 204: Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to
LINE 205: have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets
LINE 206: in the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the
LINE 207: Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat
LINE 208: down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty
LINE 209: sure that the man would not be there.
LINE 210: Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,
LINE 211: Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
LINE 212: Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under
LINE 213: some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
LINE 214: the state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and
LINE 215: many a night and day.
LINE 216: I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the
LINE 217: strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the
LINE 218: guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of
LINE 219: conspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I had
LINE 220: previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed
LINE 221: me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed
LINE 222: myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in
LINE 223: my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who
LINE 224: held it, and I screamed myself awake.
