LINE 1: If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to
LINE 2: be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O
LINE 3: the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
LINE 4: me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it
LINE 5: would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that
LINE 6: house.
LINE 7: The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a
LINE 8: widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother
LINE 9: looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother's complexion was
LINE 10: pink, and the daughter's was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,
LINE 11: and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good
LINE 12: position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,
LINE 13: if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but
LINE 14: the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and
LINE 15: that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss
LINE 16: Havisham's before the time of her seclusion.
LINE 17: In Mrs. Brandley's house and out of Mrs. Brandley's house, I suffered
LINE 18: every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The
LINE 19: nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of
LINE 20: familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my
LINE 21: distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned
LINE 22: the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a
LINE 23: constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,
LINE 24: steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brother
LINE 25: of her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself further
LINE 26: from my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her
LINE 27: by her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the
LINE 28: circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely
LINE 29: that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it
LINE 30: almost maddened me.
LINE 31: She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
LINE 32: every one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them
LINE 33: without that.
LINE 34: I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used
LINE 35: often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,
LINE 36: fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,
LINE 37: through which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me. I never
LINE 38: had one hour's happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the
LINE 39: four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with
LINE 40: me unto death.
LINE 41: Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will
LINE 42: presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually
LINE 43: reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
LINE 44: upon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check
LINE 45: in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.
LINE 46: "Pip, Pip," she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat
LINE 47: apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; "will you never
LINE 48: take warning?"
LINE 49: "Of what?"
LINE 50: "Of me."
LINE 51: "Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?"
LINE 52: "Do I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind."
LINE 53: I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the
LINE 54: reason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my
LINE 55: miseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,
LINE 56: when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My
LINE 57: dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
LINE 58: disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious
LINE 59: struggle in her bosom.
LINE 60: "At any rate," said I, "I have no warning given me just now, for you
LINE 61: wrote to me to come to you, this time."
LINE 62: "That's true," said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always
LINE 63: chilled me.
LINE 64: After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on
LINE 65: to say:—
LINE 66: "The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day
LINE 67: at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She
LINE 68: would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,
LINE 69: for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can
LINE 70: you take me?"
LINE 71: "Can I take you, Estella!"
LINE 72: "You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay
LINE 73: all charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?"
LINE 74: "And must obey," said I.
LINE 75: This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others
LINE 76: like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as
LINE 77: seen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we
LINE 78: found her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless
LINE 79: to add that there was no change in Satis House.
LINE 80: She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I
LINE 81: last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was
LINE 82: something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.
LINE 83: She hung upon Estella's beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her
LINE 84: gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked
LINE 85: at her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had
LINE 86: reared.
LINE 87: From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to
LINE 88: pry into my heart and probe its wounds. "How does she use you, Pip; how
LINE 89: does she use you?" she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,
LINE 90: even in Estella's hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at
LINE 91: night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn
LINE 92: through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by
LINE 93: dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular
LINE 94: letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;
LINE 95: and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind
LINE 96: mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch
LINE 97: stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a
LINE 98: very spectre.
LINE 99: I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of
LINE 100: dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that
LINE 101: Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that she
LINE 102: was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw
LINE 103: in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her
LINE 104: out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with
LINE 105: the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,
LINE 106: and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in
LINE 107: this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even
LINE 108: while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my
LINE 109: being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's
LINE 110: declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.
LINE 111: In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there
LINE 112: before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in
LINE 113: this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which
LINE 114: her life was hidden from the sun.
LINE 115: The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
LINE 116: the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the
LINE 117: steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I
LINE 118: looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the
LINE 119: stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the
LINE 120: table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly
LINE 121: reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I
LINE 122: saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated
LINE 123: and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across
LINE 124: the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it
LINE 125: were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the
LINE 126: crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as
LINE 127: they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the
LINE 128: gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.
LINE 129: It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
LINE 130: between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever
LINE 131: seen them opposed.
LINE 132: We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham
LINE 133: still had Estella's arm drawn through her own, and still clutched
LINE 134: Estella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.
LINE 135: She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather
LINE 136: endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.
LINE 137: "What!" said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, "are you tired
LINE 138: of me?"
LINE 139: "Only a little tired of myself," replied Estella, disengaging her arm,
LINE 140: and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at
LINE 141: the fire.
LINE 142: "Speak the truth, you ingrate!" cried Miss Havisham, passionately
LINE 143: striking her stick upon the floor; "you are tired of me."
LINE 144: Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at
LINE 145: the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a
LINE 146: self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was
LINE 147: almost cruel.
LINE 148: "You stock and stone!" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "You cold, cold heart!"
LINE 149: "What?" said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she
LINE 150: leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; "do
LINE 151: you reproach me for being cold? You?"
LINE 152: "Are you not?" was the fierce retort.
LINE 153: "You should know," said Estella. "I am what you have made me. Take all
LINE 154: the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the
LINE 155: failure; in short, take me."
LINE 156: "O, look at her, look at her!" cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; "Look at
LINE 157: her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I
LINE 158: took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its
LINE 159: stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!"
LINE 160: [Illustration]
LINE 161: "At least I was no party to the compact," said Estella, "for if I could
LINE 162: walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But
LINE 163: what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe
LINE 164: everything to you. What would you have?"
LINE 165: "Love," replied the other.
LINE 166: "You have it."
LINE 167: "I have not," said Miss Havisham.
LINE 168: "Mother by adoption," retorted Estella, never departing from the easy
LINE 169: grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never
LINE 170: yielding either to anger or tenderness,—"mother by adoption, I have
LINE 171: said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All
LINE 172: that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that,
LINE 173: I have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,
LINE 174: my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities."
LINE 175: "Did I never give her love!" cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.
LINE 176: "Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all
LINE 177: times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call
LINE 178: me mad, let her call me mad!"
LINE 179: "Why should I call you mad," returned Estella, "I, of all people? Does
LINE 180: any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I
LINE 181: do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as
LINE 182: well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool
LINE 183: that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up
LINE 184: into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!"
LINE 185: "Soon forgotten!" moaned Miss Havisham. "Times soon forgotten!"
LINE 186: "No, not forgotten," retorted Estella,—"not forgotten, but treasured up
LINE 187: in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have
LINE 188: you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving
LINE 189: admission here," she touched her bosom with her hand, "to anything that
LINE 190: you excluded? Be just to me."
LINE 191: "So proud, so proud!" moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hair
LINE 192: with both her hands.
LINE 193: "Who taught me to be proud?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I
LINE 194: learnt my lesson?"
LINE 195: "So hard, so hard!" moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.
LINE 196: "Who taught me to be hard?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I
LINE 197: learnt my lesson?"
LINE 198: "But to be proud and hard to _me_!" Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as
LINE 199: she stretched out her arms. "Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and
LINE 200: hard to _me_!"
LINE 201: Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was
LINE 202: not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at
LINE 203: the fire again.
LINE 204: "I cannot think," said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence "why
LINE 205: you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a
LINE 206: separation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have
LINE 207: never been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any
LINE 208: weakness that I can charge myself with."
LINE 209: "Would it be weakness to return my love?" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "But
LINE 210: yes, yes, she would call it so!"
LINE 211: "I begin to think," said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment
LINE 212: of calm wonder, "that I almost understand how this comes about. If you
LINE 213: had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of
LINE 214: these rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as
LINE 215: the daylight by which she had never once seen your face,—if you had
LINE 216: done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the
LINE 217: daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and
LINE 218: angry?"
LINE 219: Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,
LINE 220: and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.
LINE 221: "Or," said Estella,—"which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,
LINE 222: from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,
LINE 223: that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her
LINE 224: enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had
LINE 225: blighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,
LINE 226: for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she
LINE 227: could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?"
LINE 228: Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her
LINE 229: face), but still made no answer.
LINE 230: "So," said Estella, "I must be taken as I have been made. The success
LINE 231: is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me."
LINE 232: Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,
LINE 233: among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took
LINE 234: advantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the
LINE 235: room, after beseeching Estella's attention to her, with a movement of
LINE 236: my hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great
LINE 237: chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham's grey
LINE 238: hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and
LINE 239: was a miserable sight to see.
LINE 240: It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an
LINE 241: hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about
LINE 242: the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I
LINE 243: found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches
LINE 244: in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and
LINE 245: of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
LINE 246: banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella
LINE 247: and I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and played
LINE 248: French games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.
LINE 249: I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first
LINE 250: time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to
LINE 251: come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this
LINE 252: side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind
LINE 253: the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the
LINE 254: room overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night
LINE 255: was slow to creep on towards two o'clock, I felt that I absolutely
LINE 256: could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I
LINE 257: must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out
LINE 258: across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the
LINE 259: outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no
LINE 260: sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss
LINE 261: Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I
LINE 262: followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She
LINE 263: carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from
LINE 264: one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by
LINE 265: its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed
LINE 266: air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard
LINE 267: her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again
LINE 268: into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark
LINE 269: both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some
LINE 270: streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During
LINE 271: the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I
LINE 272: heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless
LINE 273: low cry.
LINE 274: Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between
LINE 275: her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and
LINE 276: there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,
LINE 277: did Miss Havisham's manner towards Estella in anywise change, except
LINE 278: that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
LINE 279: characteristics.
LINE 280: It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley
LINE 281: Drummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly.
LINE 282: On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and
LINE 283: when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's
LINE 284: agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to
LINE 285: order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,
LINE 286: according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's
LINE 287: turn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me
LINE 288: while the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost
LINE 289: between us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when
LINE 290: he called upon the company to pledge him to "Estella!"
LINE 291: "Estella who?" said I.
LINE 292: "Never you mind," retorted Drummle.
LINE 293: "Estella of where?" said I. "You are bound to say of where." Which he
LINE 294: was, as a Finch.
LINE 295: "Of Richmond, gentlemen," said Drummle, putting me out of the question,
LINE 296: "and a peerless beauty."
LINE 297: Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I
LINE 298: whispered Herbert.
LINE 299: "I know that lady," said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had
LINE 300: been honoured.
LINE 301: "_Do_ you?" said Drummle.
LINE 302: "And so do I," I added, with a scarlet face.
LINE 303: "_Do_ you?" said Drummle. "_O_, Lord!"
LINE 304: This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy
LINE 305: creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it
LINE 306: as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place
LINE 307: and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable
LINE 308: Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about
LINE 309: coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of
LINE 310: expression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew
LINE 311: nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by
LINE 312: that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew
LINE 313: where I was to be found.
LINE 314: Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,
LINE 315: after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The
LINE 316: debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more
LINE 317: honourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they
LINE 318: believed _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was
LINE 319: decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle
LINE 320: would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that
LINE 321: he had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,
LINE 322: as a gentleman and a Finch, for "having been betrayed into a warmth
LINE 323: which." Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour
LINE 324: should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a
LINE 325: polite little avowal in Estella's hand, that she had had the honour of
LINE 326: dancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret
LINE 327: that I had been "betrayed into a warmth which," and on the whole to
LINE 328: repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.
LINE 329: Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the
LINE 330: Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the
LINE 331: promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing
LINE 332: rate.
LINE 333: I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot
LINE 334: adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should
LINE 335: show any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far
LINE 336: below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been
LINE 337: referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my
LINE 338: love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to
LINE 339: that hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had
LINE 340: favoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind
LINE 341: and degree of distress.
LINE 342: It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle
LINE 343: had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A
LINE 344: little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed
LINE 345: one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and
LINE 346: Estella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,
LINE 347: now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him
LINE 348: very well, now scarcely remembering who he was.
LINE 349: The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,
LINE 350: however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a
LINE 351: blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which
LINE 352: sometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place of
LINE 353: concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching
LINE 354: Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil
LINE 355: himself and drop at the right nick of time.
LINE 356: At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls
LINE 357: at most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,
LINE 358: this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration
LINE 359: on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the
LINE 360: next opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to
LINE 361: take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I
LINE 362: was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such
LINE 363: places.
LINE 364: "Are you tired, Estella?"
LINE 365: "Rather, Pip."
LINE 366: "You should be."
LINE 367: "Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to
LINE 368: write, before I go to sleep."
LINE 369: "Recounting to-night's triumph?" said I. "Surely a very poor one,
LINE 370: Estella."
LINE 371: "What do you mean? I didn't know there had been any."
LINE 372: "Estella," said I, "do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is
LINE 373: looking over here at us."
LINE 374: "Why should I look at him?" returned Estella, with her eyes on me
LINE 375: instead. "What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to use
LINE 376: your words,—that I need look at?"
LINE 377: "Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you," said I. "For he
LINE 378: has been hovering about you all night."
LINE 379: "Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures," replied Estella, with a
LINE 380: glance towards him, "hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help
LINE 381: it?"
LINE 382: "No," I returned; "but cannot the Estella help it?"
LINE 383: "Well!" said she, laughing, after a moment, "perhaps. Yes. Anything you
LINE 384: like."
LINE 385: "But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should
LINE 386: encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is
LINE 387: despised."
LINE 388: "Well?" said she.
LINE 389: "You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,
LINE 390: ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow."
LINE 391: "Well?" said she.
LINE 392: "You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous
LINE 393: roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?"
LINE 394: "Well?" said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her
LINE 395: lovely eyes the wider.
LINE 396: To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it
LINE 397: from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, "Well! Then, that is
LINE 398: why it makes me wretched."
LINE 399: Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea
LINE 400: of making me—me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;
LINE 401: but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the
LINE 402: question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.
LINE 403: "Pip," said Estella, casting her glance over the room, "don't be
LINE 404: foolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and
LINE 405: may be meant to have. It's not worth discussing."
LINE 406: "Yes it is," said I, "because I cannot bear that people should say,
LINE 407: 'she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest
LINE 408: in the crowd.'"
LINE 409: "I can bear it," said Estella.
LINE 410: "Oh! don't be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible."
LINE 411: "Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!" said Estella, opening
LINE 412: her hands. "And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a
LINE 413: boor!"
LINE 414: "There is no doubt you do," said I, something hurriedly, "for I have
LINE 415: seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never
LINE 416: give to—me."
LINE 417: "Do you want me then," said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and
LINE 418: serious, if not angry, look, "to deceive and entrap you?"
LINE 419: "Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?"
LINE 420: "Yes, and many others,—all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I'll
LINE 421: say no more."
LINE 422: And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled
LINE 423: my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on
LINE 424: unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the
LINE 425: event that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world
LINE 426: held Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving
LINE 427: its first distortions from Miss Havisham's wasting hands.
LINE 428: In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
LINE 429: state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry,
LINE 430: the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried
LINE 431: through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in
LINE 432: the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of
LINE 433: hollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labour,
LINE 434: and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and
LINE 435: the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring
LINE 436: was put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and
LINE 437: rushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near
LINE 438: and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an
LINE 439: instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon
LINE 440: me.
