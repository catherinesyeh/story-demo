LINE 1: Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,
LINE 2: and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain,
LINE 3: and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at
LINE 4: the Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him
LINE 5: as I did.
LINE 6: My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed
LINE 7: for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the
LINE 8: want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve
LINE 9: it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But
LINE 10: I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
LINE 11: money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
LINE 12: plans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,
LINE 13: to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whether
LINE 14: it was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited by
LINE 15: his generosity since his revelation of himself.
LINE 16: As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella
LINE 17: was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a
LINE 18: conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had
LINE 19: confided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her
LINE 20: to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
LINE 21: hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you
LINE 22: who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own
LINE 23: last year, last month, last week?
LINE 24: It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,
LINE 25: towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a
LINE 26: range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause
LINE 27: for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror
LINE 28: fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would
LINE 29: with dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be
LINE 30: fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, and
LINE 31: much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to
LINE 32: inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed
LINE 33: about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.
LINE 34: There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could
LINE 35: not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London
LINE 36: Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be
LINE 37: brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing
LINE 38: this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
LINE 39: water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings
LINE 40: that I have now to tell of.
LINE 41: One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the
LINE 42: wharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,
LINE 43: and had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had
LINE 44: become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back
LINE 45: among the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I
LINE 46: had seen the signal in his window, All well.
LINE 47: As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort
LINE 48: myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and
LINE 49: solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would
LINE 50: afterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved
LINE 51: his questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is
LINE 52: nowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that
LINE 53: Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the
LINE 54: contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously
LINE 55: heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection
LINE 56: with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen
LINE 57: him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red
LINE 58: brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.
LINE 59: I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,
LINE 60: where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every
LINE 61: half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the
LINE 62: knives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the
LINE 63: Lord Mayor's dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time
LINE 64: in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of
LINE 65: dinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.
LINE 66: There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty's service,—a most
LINE 67: excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so
LINE 68: tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked all
LINE 69: the little men's hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and
LINE 70: brave, and who wouldn't hear of anybody's paying taxes, though he was
LINE 71: very patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in
LINE 72: the cloth, and on that property married a young person in
LINE 73: bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of
LINE 74: Portsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach
LINE 75: to rub their own hands and shake everybody else's, and sing "Fill,
LINE 76: fill!" A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or
LINE 77: do anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly
LINE 78: stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed
LINE 79: to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so
LINE 80: effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political
LINE 81: influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then
LINE 82: it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white
LINE 83: hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a
LINE 84: gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down
LINE 85: from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn't confute with what he had
LINE 86: overheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle's (who had never been heard of
LINE 87: before) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of
LINE 88: great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all
LINE 89: to go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down
LINE 90: the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The
LINE 91: boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on
LINE 92: the Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your
LINE 93: Honour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,
LINE 94: conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into
LINE 95: a dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that
LINE 96: corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of
LINE 97: me.
LINE 98: The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in
LINE 99: the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.
LINE 100: Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric
LINE 101: countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in
LINE 102: the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great
LINE 103: cowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.
LINE 104: But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,
LINE 105: the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account of
LINE 106: the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of
LINE 107: his daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a
LINE 108: flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententious
LINE 109: Enchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,
LINE 110: after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a
LINE 111: high-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.
LINE 112: The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked
LINE 113: at, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various
LINE 114: colours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with
LINE 115: great surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he
LINE 116: were lost in amazement.
LINE 117: There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.
LINE 118: Wopsle's eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
LINE 119: mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat
LINE 120: thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
LINE 121: watch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of
LINE 122: it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him
LINE 123: waiting for me near the door.
LINE 124: "How do you do?" said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the
LINE 125: street together. "I saw that you saw me."
LINE 126: "Saw you, Mr. Pip!" he returned. "Yes, of course I saw you. But who
LINE 127: else was there?"
LINE 128: "Who else?"
LINE 129: "It is the strangest thing," said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost
LINE 130: look again; "and yet I could swear to him."
LINE 131: Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.
LINE 132: "Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,"
LINE 133: said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, "I can't be positive;
LINE 134: yet I think I should."
LINE 135: Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me
LINE 136: when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.
LINE 137: "Oh! He can't be in sight," said Mr. Wopsle. "He went out before I went
LINE 138: off. I saw him go."
LINE 139: Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected
LINE 140: this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some
LINE 141: admission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but
LINE 142: said nothing.
LINE 143: "I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw
LINE 144: that you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a
LINE 145: ghost."
LINE 146: My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak
LINE 147: yet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on
LINE 148: to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was
LINE 149: perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.
LINE 150: "I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is
LINE 151: so very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I
LINE 152: could hardly believe it myself, if you told me."
LINE 153: "Indeed?" said I.
LINE 154: "No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas
LINE 155: Day, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some
LINE 156: soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?"
LINE 157: "I remember it very well."
LINE 158: "And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that
LINE 159: we joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took
LINE 160: the lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?"
LINE 161: "I remember it all very well." Better than he thought,—except the last
LINE 162: clause.
LINE 163: "And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that
LINE 164: there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been
LINE 165: severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?"
LINE 166: "I see it all before me."
LINE 167: "And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,
LINE 168: and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,
LINE 169: with the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular about
LINE 170: that,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an
LINE 171: outer ring of dark night all about us?"
LINE 172: "Yes," said I. "I remember all that."
LINE 173: "Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I
LINE 174: saw him over your shoulder."
LINE 175: "Steady!" I thought. I asked him then, "Which of the two do you suppose
LINE 176: you saw?"
LINE 177: "The one who had been mauled," he answered readily, "and I'll swear I
LINE 178: saw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him."
LINE 179: "This is very curious!" said I, with the best assumption I could put on
LINE 180: of its being nothing more to me. "Very curious indeed!"
LINE 181: I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation
LINE 182: threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's
LINE 183: having been behind me "like a ghost." For if he had ever been out of my
LINE 184: thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was
LINE 185: in those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I
LINE 186: should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I
LINE 187: had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had
LINE 188: found him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,
LINE 189: because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger
LINE 190: there might be about us, danger was always near and active.
LINE 191: I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He
LINE 192: could not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.
LINE 193: It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to
LINE 194: identify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,
LINE 195: and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How
LINE 196: was he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,
LINE 197: in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I
LINE 198: believed not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no
LINE 199: especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a
LINE 200: face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.
LINE 201: When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I
LINE 202: extract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate
LINE 203: refreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was
LINE 204: between twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates
LINE 205: were shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.
LINE 206: Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.
LINE 207: But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what
LINE 208: I had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his
LINE 209: hint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to
LINE 210: the Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I
LINE 211: went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.
LINE 212: Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very
LINE 213: cautious. And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before,
LINE 214: if that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks's
LINE 215: Basin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank
LINE 216: as I looked at anything else.
