LINE 1: After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar
LINE 2: in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's
LINE 3: being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham's.
LINE 4: "Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip," said my guardian,
LINE 5: comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, "because the man
LINE 6: who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man." It seemed
LINE 7: quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not
LINE 8: exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a
LINE 9: satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. "Very
LINE 10: good, Pip," he observed, when I had concluded, "I'll go round
LINE 11: presently, and pay our friend off." Rather alarmed by this summary
LINE 12: action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend
LINE 13: himself might be difficult to deal with. "Oh no he won't," said my
LINE 14: guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect
LINE 15: confidence; "I should like to see him argue the question with _me_."
LINE 16: As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I
LINE 17: breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely
LINE 18: hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a
LINE 19: walk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers
LINE 20: was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into
LINE 21: my place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar
LINE 22: immediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of
LINE 23: miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I
LINE 24: got round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and
LINE 25: felt myself in comparative security.
LINE 26: It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was
LINE 27: not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared
LINE 28: after. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops
LINE 29: and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,
LINE 30: as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on which
LINE 31: occasions I don't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they
LINE 32: of not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a
LINE 33: distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until
LINE 34: Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.
LINE 35: Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I
LINE 36: beheld Trabb's boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.
LINE 37: Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best
LINE 38: beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced
LINE 39: with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating
LINE 40: myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's boy smote
LINE 41: together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in
LINE 42: every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,
LINE 43: "Hold me! I'm so frightened!" feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
LINE 44: contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed
LINE 45: him, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of
LINE 46: extreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.
LINE 47: This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced
LINE 48: another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,
LINE 49: and indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching. He was coming
LINE 50: round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest
LINE 51: industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with
LINE 52: cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became
LINE 53: aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his
LINE 54: motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees
LINE 55: more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His
LINE 56: sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,
LINE 57: and I felt utterly confounded.
LINE 58: I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when
LINE 59: I again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he
LINE 60: was entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my
LINE 61: great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the
LINE 62: opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young
LINE 63: friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his
LINE 64: hand, "Don't know yah!" Words cannot state the amount of aggravation
LINE 65: and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me,
LINE 66: he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm
LINE 67: akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,
LINE 68: and drawling to his attendants, "Don't know yah, don't know yah, 'pon
LINE 69: my soul don't know yah!" The disgrace attendant on his immediately
LINE 70: afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with
LINE 71: crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was
LINE 72: a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and
LINE 73: was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.
LINE 74: [Illustration]
LINE 75: But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I
LINE 76: really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To have
LINE 77: struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower
LINE 78: recompense from him than his heart's best blood, would have been futile
LINE 79: and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an
LINE 80: invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew
LINE 81: out again between his captor's legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,
LINE 82: however, to Mr. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mr. Pip must
LINE 83: decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed
LINE 84: to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited
LINE 85: Loathing in every respectable mind.
LINE 86: The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my
LINE 87: box-seat again, and arrived in London safe,—but not sound, for my heart
LINE 88: was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel
LINE 89: of oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then
LINE 90: went on to Barnard's Inn.
LINE 91: I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.
LINE 92: Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to
LINE 93: the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my
LINE 94: friend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger
LINE 95: in the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an
LINE 96: antechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of
LINE 97: the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be
LINE 98: afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to
LINE 99: find him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to
LINE 100: Hyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was.
LINE 101: Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to
LINE 102: Herbert, "My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell
LINE 103: you."
LINE 104: "My dear Handel," he returned, "I shall esteem and respect your
LINE 105: confidence."
LINE 106: "It concerns myself, Herbert," said I, "and one other person."
LINE 107: Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,
LINE 108: and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I
LINE 109: didn't go on.
LINE 110: "Herbert," said I, laying my hand upon his knee, "I love—I
LINE 111: adore—Estella."
LINE 112: Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy
LINE 113: matter-of-course way, "Exactly. Well?"
LINE 114: "Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?"
LINE 115: "What next, I mean?" said Herbert. "Of course I know _that_."
LINE 116: "How do you know it?" said I.
LINE 117: "How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you."
LINE 118: "I never told you."
LINE 119: "Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I
LINE 120: have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since
LINE 121: I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
LINE 122: together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you
LINE 123: told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her
LINE 124: the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed."
LINE 125: "Very well, then," said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
LINE 126: light, "I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a
LINE 127: most beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And
LINE 128: if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her."
LINE 129: "Lucky for you then, Handel," said Herbert, "that you are picked out
LINE 130: for her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground,
LINE 131: we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
LINE 132: that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella's views on the adoration
LINE 133: question?"
LINE 134: I shook my head gloomily. "Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from
LINE 135: me," said I.
LINE 136: "Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have
LINE 137: something more to say?"
LINE 138: "I am ashamed to say it," I returned, "and yet it's no worse to say it
LINE 139: than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a
LINE 140: blacksmith's boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?"
LINE 141: "Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase," returned Herbert, smiling,
LINE 142: and clapping his hand on the back of mine—"a good fellow, with
LINE 143: impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and
LINE 144: dreaming, curiously mixed in him."
LINE 145: I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this
LINE 146: mixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the
LINE 147: analysis, but thought it not worth disputing.
LINE 148: "When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert," I went on, "I
LINE 149: suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have
LINE 150: done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised
LINE 151: me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella—"
LINE 152: ("And when don't you, you know?" Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the
LINE 153: fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)
LINE 154: "—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
LINE 155: I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden
LINE 156: ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of
LINE 157: one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the
LINE 158: best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what
LINE 159: they are!" In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been
LINE 160: there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.
LINE 161: "Now, Handel," Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, "it seems to
LINE 162: me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into
LINE 163: our gift-horse's mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to
LINE 164: me that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether
LINE 165: overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn't you tell me that
LINE 166: your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were
LINE 167: not endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you
LINE 168: so,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that of
LINE 169: all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations
LINE 170: towards you unless he were sure of his ground?"
LINE 171: I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people
LINE 172: often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth
LINE 173: and justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!
LINE 174: "I should think it _was_ a strong point," said Herbert, "and I should
LINE 175: think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you
LINE 176: must bide your guardian's time, and he must bide his client's time.
LINE 177: You'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then
LINE 178: perhaps you'll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you'll be
LINE 179: nearer getting it, for it must come at last."
LINE 180: "What a hopeful disposition you have!" said I, gratefully admiring his
LINE 181: cheery ways.
LINE 182: "I ought to have," said Herbert, "for I have not much else. I must
LINE 183: acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is
LINE 184: not my own, but my father's. The only remark I ever heard him make on
LINE 185: your story, was the final one, "The thing is settled and done, or Mr.
LINE 186: Jaggers would not be in it." And now before I say anything more about
LINE 187: my father, or my father's son, and repay confidence with confidence, I
LINE 188: want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a
LINE 189: moment,—positively repulsive."
LINE 190: "You won't succeed," said I.
LINE 191: "O yes I shall!" said he. "One, two, three, and now I am in for it.
LINE 192: Handel, my good fellow;"—though he spoke in this light tone, he was
LINE 193: very much in earnest,—"I have been thinking since we have been talking
LINE 194: with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition
LINE 195: of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am
LINE 196: I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never
LINE 197: referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,
LINE 198: for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage
LINE 199: ultimately?"
LINE 200: "Never."
LINE 201: "Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my
LINE 202: soul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself
LINE 203: from her?—I told you I should be disagreeable."
LINE 204: I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old
LINE 205: marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had
LINE 206: subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were
LINE 207: solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,
LINE 208: smote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little
LINE 209: while.
LINE 210: "Yes; but my dear Handel," Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,
LINE 211: instead of silent, "its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
LINE 212: a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very
LINE 213: serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of
LINE 214: what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may
LINE 215: lead to miserable things."
LINE 216: "I know it, Herbert," said I, with my head still turned away, "but I
LINE 217: can't help it."
LINE 218: "You can't detach yourself?"
LINE 219: "No. Impossible!"
LINE 220: "You can't try, Handel?"
LINE 221: "No. Impossible!"
LINE 222: "Well!" said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been
LINE 223: asleep, and stirring the fire, "now I'll endeavour to make myself
LINE 224: agreeable again!"
LINE 225: So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in
LINE 226: their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,
LINE 227: looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and
LINE 228: came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left
LINE 229: leg in both arms.
LINE 230: "I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my
LINE 231: father's son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father's son
LINE 232: to remark that my father's establishment is not particularly brilliant
LINE 233: in its housekeeping."
LINE 234: "There is always plenty, Herbert," said I, to say something
LINE 235: encouraging.
LINE 236: "O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest
LINE 237: approval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.
LINE 238: Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as
LINE 239: well as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had not
LINE 240: given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask
LINE 241: you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part
LINE 242: of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are
LINE 243: always most particularly anxious to be married?"
LINE 244: This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, "Is it
LINE 245: so?"
LINE 246: "I don't know," said Herbert, "that's what I want to know. Because it
LINE 247: is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next
LINE 248: me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little
LINE 249: Jane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you
LINE 250: might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual
LINE 251: contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already
LINE 252: made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.
LINE 253: And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby."
LINE 254: "Then you are?" said I.
LINE 255: "I am," said Herbert; "but it's a secret."
LINE 256: I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with
LINE 257: further particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my
LINE 258: weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.
LINE 259: "May I ask the name?" I said.
LINE 260: "Name of Clara," said Herbert.
LINE 261: "Live in London?"
LINE 262: "Yes, perhaps I ought to mention," said Herbert, who had become
LINE 263: curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting
LINE 264: theme, "that she is rather below my mother's nonsensical family
LINE 265: notions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.
LINE 266: I think he was a species of purser."
LINE 267: "What is he now?" said I.
LINE 268: "He's an invalid now," replied Herbert.
LINE 269: "Living on—?"
LINE 270: "On the first floor," said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,
LINE 271: for I had intended my question to apply to his means. "I have never
LINE 272: seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known
LINE 273: Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous
LINE 274: rows,—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument." In
LINE 275: looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time
LINE 276: recovered his usual lively manner.
LINE 277: "Don't you expect to see him?" said I.
LINE 278: "O yes, I constantly expect to see him," returned Herbert, "because I
LINE 279: never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the
LINE 280: ceiling. But I don't know how long the rafters may hold."
LINE 281: When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told
LINE 282: me that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention to
LINE 283: marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,
LINE 284: engendering low spirits, "But you _can't_ marry, you know, while you're
LINE 285: looking about you."
LINE 286: As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision
LINE 287: to realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my
LINE 288: pockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my
LINE 289: attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received
LINE 290: from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian
LINE 291: renown. "And bless my heart," I involuntarily added aloud, "it's
LINE 292: to-night!"
LINE 293: This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve
LINE 294: to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet
LINE 295: Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable
LINE 296: means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me
LINE 297: by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had
LINE 298: warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our
LINE 299: candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest
LINE 300: of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.
