LINE 1: Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to
LINE 2: see him. "For, I really am not," he added, with his son's smile, "an
LINE 3: alarming personage." He was a young-looking man, in spite of his
LINE 4: perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite
LINE 5: natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;
LINE 6: there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would
LINE 7: have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was
LINE 8: very near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to
LINE 9: Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which
LINE 10: were black and handsome, "Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?"
LINE 11: And she looked up from her book, and said, "Yes." She then smiled upon
LINE 12: me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of
LINE 13: orange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on
LINE 14: any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been
LINE 15: thrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational
LINE 16: condescension.
LINE 17: I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.
LINE 18: Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
LINE 19: Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased
LINE 20: father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined
LINE 21: opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, if
LINE 22: I ever knew,—the Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lord
LINE 23: Chancellor's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's, anybody's,—and had tacked
LINE 24: himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
LINE 25: supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for
LINE 26: storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate
LINE 27: address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first
LINE 28: stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage
LINE 29: either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed
LINE 30: Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature
LINE 31: of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the
LINE 32: acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.
LINE 33: So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
LINE 34: by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but
LINE 35: perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,
LINE 36: in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was
LINE 37: also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to
LINE 38: mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing
LINE 39: the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket
LINE 40: had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it
LINE 41: would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the
LINE 42: knowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing
LINE 43: to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that
LINE 44: dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket
LINE 45: that his wife was "a treasure for a Prince." Mr. Pocket had invested
LINE 46: the Prince's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was
LINE 47: supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.
LINE 48: Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,
LINE 49: because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of
LINE 50: a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.
LINE 51: Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a
LINE 52: pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for
LINE 53: my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other
LINE 54: similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle
LINE 55: and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of
LINE 56: architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,
LINE 57: was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of
LINE 58: exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.
LINE 59: Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
LINE 60: else's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house
LINE 61: and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the
LINE 62: servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of
LINE 63: saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the
LINE 64: servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their
LINE 65: eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They
LINE 66: allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always
LINE 67: appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded
LINE 68: in would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable of
LINE 69: self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady
LINE 70: with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that
LINE 71: she had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.
LINE 72: Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it
LINE 73: was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn't mind their own
LINE 74: business.
LINE 75: By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been
LINE 76: educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished
LINE 77: himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket
LINE 78: very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the
LINE 79: calling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom
LINE 80: it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always
LINE 81: going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the
LINE 82: blades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work and
LINE 83: had come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he
LINE 84: had "read" with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,
LINE 85: and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned
LINE 86: his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,
LINE 87: and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still
LINE 88: maintained the house I saw.
LINE 89: Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highly
LINE 90: sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,
LINE 91: and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.
LINE 92: This lady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her
LINE 93: down to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand
LINE 94: on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.
LINE 95: Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read
LINE 96: with him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and
LINE 97: confidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five
LINE 98: minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.
LINE 99: "But dear Mrs. Pocket," said Mrs. Coiler, "after her early
LINE 100: disappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),
LINE 101: requires so much luxury and elegance—"
LINE 102: "Yes, ma'am," I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to
LINE 103: cry.
LINE 104: "And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—"
LINE 105: "Yes, ma'am," I said again, with the same object as before.
LINE 106: "—That it _is_ hard," said Mrs. Coiler, "to have dear Mr. Pocket's time
LINE 107: and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket."
LINE 108: I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time
LINE 109: and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,
LINE 110: and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company
LINE 111: manners.
LINE 112: It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and
LINE 113: Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and
LINE 114: other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian
LINE 115: name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It
LINE 116: further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the
LINE 117: garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which
LINE 118: her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at
LINE 119: all. Drummle didn't say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a
LINE 120: sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.
LINE 121: Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler
LINE 122: the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the
LINE 123: conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but
LINE 124: it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the
LINE 125: announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook
LINE 126: had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first
LINE 127: time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance
LINE 128: that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on
LINE 129: anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He
LINE 130: laid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at the
LINE 131: moment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make
LINE 132: an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done
LINE 133: this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with
LINE 134: what he was about.
LINE 135: Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked
LINE 136: it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the
LINE 137: pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me
LINE 138: when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
LINE 139: localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and
LINE 140: when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little
LINE 141: to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for
LINE 142: being on the opposite side of the table.
LINE 143: After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made
LINE 144: admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of
LINE 145: improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little
LINE 146: boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next
LINE 147: successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and
LINE 148: Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been
LINE 149: recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.
LINE 150: Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she
LINE 151: rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but
LINE 152: didn't quite know what to make of them.
LINE 153: "Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby," said Flopson. "Don't
LINE 154: take it that way, or you'll get its head under the table."
LINE 155: Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon
LINE 156: the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious
LINE 157: concussion.
LINE 158: "Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum," said Flopson; "and Miss Jane, come
LINE 159: and dance to baby, do!"
LINE 160: One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
LINE 161: taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place
LINE 162: by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and
LINE 163: laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the
LINE 164: meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,
LINE 165: and we all laughed and were glad.
LINE 166: Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,
LINE 167: then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers
LINE 168: to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice
LINE 169: that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its
LINE 170: eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the
LINE 171: two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase
LINE 172: with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly
LINE 173: lost half his buttons at the gaming-table.
LINE 174: I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a
LINE 175: discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a
LINE 176: sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the
LINE 177: baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.
LINE 178: At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,
LINE 179: softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the
LINE 180: dangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the
LINE 181: same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—
LINE 182: "You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!"
LINE 183: "Mamma dear," lisped the little girl, "baby ood have put hith eyeth
LINE 184: out."
LINE 185: "How dare you tell me so?" retorted Mrs. Pocket. "Go and sit down in
LINE 186: your chair this moment!"
LINE 187: Mrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if
LINE 188: I myself had done something to rouse it.
LINE 189: "Belinda," remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,
LINE 190: "how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the
LINE 191: protection of baby."
LINE 192: "I will not allow anybody to interfere," said Mrs. Pocket. "I am
LINE 193: surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of
LINE 194: interference."
LINE 195: "Good God!" cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.
LINE 196: "Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to
LINE 197: save them?"
LINE 198: "I will not be interfered with by Jane," said Mrs. Pocket, with a
LINE 199: majestic glance at that innocent little offender. "I hope I know my
LINE 200: poor grandpapa's position. Jane, indeed!"
LINE 201: Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did
LINE 202: lift himself some inches out of his chair. "Hear this!" he helplessly
LINE 203: exclaimed to the elements. "Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for
LINE 204: people's poor grandpapa's positions!" Then he let himself down again,
LINE 205: and became silent.
LINE 206: We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A
LINE 207: pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a
LINE 208: series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the
LINE 209: only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had
LINE 210: any decided acquaintance.
LINE 211: "Mr. Drummle," said Mrs. Pocket, "will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you
LINE 212: undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with
LINE 213: ma!"
LINE 214: The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It
LINE 215: doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a
LINE 216: pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its
LINE 217: soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it
LINE 218: gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a
LINE 219: few minutes, being nursed by little Jane.
LINE 220: It happened that the other five children were left behind at the
LINE 221: dinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and
LINE 222: their not being anybody else's business. I thus became aware of the
LINE 223: mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in
LINE 224: the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his
LINE 225: face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,
LINE 226: as if he couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in
LINE 227: that establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on
LINE 228: somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain
LINE 229: questions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,
LINE 230: Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fanny
LINE 231: came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it
LINE 232: when she didn't forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and
LINE 233: gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as
LINE 234: they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the
LINE 235: hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.
LINE 236: In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop
LINE 237: had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I
LINE 238: was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but
LINE 239: as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to
LINE 240: say for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the
LINE 241: tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to
LINE 242: whom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority
LINE 243: confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he
LINE 244: could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt
LINE 245: if he would have paid it.
LINE 246: There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we
LINE 247: should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable
LINE 248: domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid
LINE 249: came in, and said, "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you."
LINE 250: "Speak to your master?" said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused
LINE 251: again. "How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or
LINE 252: speak to me—at some other time."
LINE 253: "Begging your pardon, ma'am," returned the housemaid, "I should wish to
LINE 254: speak at once, and to speak to master."
LINE 255: Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of
LINE 256: ourselves until he came back.
LINE 257: "This is a pretty thing, Belinda!" said Mr. Pocket, returning with a
LINE 258: countenance expressive of grief and despair. "Here's the cook lying
LINE 259: insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh
LINE 260: butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!"
LINE 261: Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, "This is
LINE 262: that odious Sophia's doing!"
LINE 263: "What do you mean, Belinda?" demanded Mr. Pocket.
LINE 264: "Sophia has told you," said Mrs. Pocket. "Did I not see her with my own
LINE 265: eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask
LINE 266: to speak to you?"
LINE 267: "But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda," returned Mr. Pocket,
LINE 268: "and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?"
LINE 269: "And do you defend her, Matthew," said Mrs. Pocket, "for making
LINE 270: mischief?"
LINE 271: Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.
LINE 272: "Am I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?" said
LINE 273: Mrs. Pocket. "Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful
LINE 274: woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after
LINE 275: the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess."
LINE 276: There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the
LINE 277: attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a
LINE 278: hollow voice, "Good night, Mr. Pip," when I deemed it advisable to go
LINE 279: to bed and leave him.
