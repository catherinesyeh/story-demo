LINE 1: It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe
LINE 2: arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss
LINE 3: Havisham's. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the
LINE 4: occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in
LINE 5: his working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so
LINE 6: dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for
LINE 7: me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the
LINE 8: hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.
LINE 9: At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town
LINE 10: with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for "when we
LINE 11: had done with our fine ladies"—a way of putting the case, from which
LINE 12: Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the
LINE 13: day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to
LINE 14: do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable
LINE 15: HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
LINE 16: direction he had taken.
LINE 17: We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
LINE 18: bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited
LINE 19: Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was
LINE 20: a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were
LINE 21: carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were
LINE 22: displayed as articles of property,—much as Cleopatra or any other
LINE 23: sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or
LINE 24: procession.
LINE 25: When we came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and left us. As it
LINE 26: was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house.
LINE 27: Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe
LINE 28: took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands;
LINE 29: as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to
LINE 30: half a quarter of an ounce.
LINE 31: Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew
LINE 32: so well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back
LINE 33: at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the
LINE 34: greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
LINE 35: his toes.
LINE 36: Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff
LINE 37: and conducted him into Miss Havisham's presence. She was seated at her
LINE 38: dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.
LINE 39: "Oh!" said she to Joe. "You are the husband of the sister of this boy?"
LINE 40: I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or
LINE 41: so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with
LINE 42: his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a
LINE 43: worm.
LINE 44: "You are the husband," repeated Miss Havisham, "of the sister of this
LINE 45: boy?"
LINE 46: It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted
LINE 47: in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.
LINE 48: "Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe now observed in a manner that was at
LINE 49: once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great
LINE 50: politeness, "as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time
LINE 51: what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man."
LINE 52: "Well!" said Miss Havisham. "And you have reared the boy, with the
LINE 53: intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?"
LINE 54: "You know, Pip," replied Joe, "as you and me were ever friends, and it
LINE 55: were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to
LINE 56: larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the
LINE 57: business,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—not
LINE 58: but what they would have been attended to, don't you see?"
LINE 59: "Has the boy," said Miss Havisham, "ever made any objection? Does he
LINE 60: like the trade?"
LINE 61: "Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip," returned Joe,
LINE 62: strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and
LINE 63: politeness, "that it were the wish of your own hart." (I saw the idea
LINE 64: suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the
LINE 65: occasion, before he went on to say) "And there weren't no objection on
LINE 66: your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!"
LINE 67: It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he
LINE 68: ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to
LINE 69: him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he
LINE 70: persisted in being to Me.
LINE 71: "Have you brought his indentures with you?" asked Miss Havisham.
LINE 72: "Well, Pip, you know," replied Joe, as if that were a little
LINE 73: unreasonable, "you yourself see me put 'em in my 'at, and therefore you
LINE 74: know as they are here." With which he took them out, and gave them, not
LINE 75: to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good
LINE 76: fellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood at
LINE 77: the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and that her eyes laughed
LINE 78: mischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to
LINE 79: Miss Havisham.
LINE 80: "You expected," said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, "no
LINE 81: premium with the boy?"
LINE 82: "Joe!" I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. "Why don't you
LINE 83: answer—"
LINE 84: "Pip," returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, "which I
LINE 85: meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
LINE 86: and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it
LINE 87: to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?"
LINE 88: Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
LINE 89: better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took
LINE 90: up a little bag from the table beside her.
LINE 91: "Pip has earned a premium here," she said, "and here it is. There are
LINE 92: five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip."
LINE 93: As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in
LINE 94: him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,
LINE 95: persisted in addressing me.
LINE 96: "This is wery liberal on your part, Pip," said Joe, "and it is as such
LINE 97: received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,
LINE 98: nor nowheres. And now, old chap," said Joe, conveying to me a
LINE 99: sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that
LINE 100: familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—"and now, old chap,
LINE 101: may we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and
LINE 102: another, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—for
LINE 103: the satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—" here Joe showed that he
LINE 104: felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly
LINE 105: rescued himself with the words, "and from myself far be it!" These
LINE 106: words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them
LINE 107: twice.
LINE 108: "Good-bye, Pip!" said Miss Havisham. "Let them out, Estella."
LINE 109: "Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?" I asked.
LINE 110: "No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!"
LINE 111: Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe
LINE 112: in a distinct emphatic voice, "The boy has been a good boy here, and
LINE 113: that is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no
LINE 114: other and no more."
LINE 115: How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I
LINE 116: know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs
LINE 117: instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went
LINE 118: after him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the
LINE 119: gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the
LINE 120: daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,
LINE 121: "Astonishing!" And there he remained so long saying, "Astonishing" at
LINE 122: intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming
LINE 123: back. At length he prolonged his remark into "Pip, I do assure _you_
LINE 124: this is as-TON-ishing!" and so, by degrees, became conversational and
LINE 125: able to walk away.
LINE 126: I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the
LINE 127: encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's
LINE 128: he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what
LINE 129: took place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlour: where, on our presenting
LINE 130: ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.
LINE 131: "Well?" cried my sister, addressing us both at once. "And what's
LINE 132: happened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor
LINE 133: society as this, I am sure I do!"
LINE 134: "Miss Havisham," said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of
LINE 135: remembrance, "made it wery partick'ler that we should give her—were it
LINE 136: compliments or respects, Pip?"
LINE 137: "Compliments," I said.
LINE 138: "Which that were my own belief," answered Joe; "her compliments to Mrs.
LINE 139: J. Gargery—"
LINE 140: "Much good they'll do me!" observed my sister; but rather gratified
LINE 141: too.
LINE 142: "And wishing," pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another
LINE 143: effort of remembrance, "that the state of Miss Havisham's elth were
LINE 144: sitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?"
LINE 145: "Of her having the pleasure," I added.
LINE 146: "Of ladies' company," said Joe. And drew a long breath.
LINE 147: "Well!" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.
LINE 148: "She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but
LINE 149: it's better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole
LINE 150: here?"
LINE 151: "She giv' him," said Joe, "nothing."
LINE 152: Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.
LINE 153: "What she giv'," said Joe, "she giv' to his friends. 'And by his
LINE 154: friends,' were her explanation, 'I mean into the hands of his sister
LINE 155: Mrs. J. Gargery.' Them were her words; 'Mrs. J. Gargery.' She mayn't
LINE 156: have know'd," added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, "whether it
LINE 157: were Joe, or Jorge."
LINE 158: My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden
LINE 159: arm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all
LINE 160: about it beforehand.
LINE 161: "And how much have you got?" asked my sister, laughing. Positively
LINE 162: laughing!
LINE 163: "What would present company say to ten pound?" demanded Joe.
LINE 164: "They'd say," returned my sister, curtly, "pretty well. Not too much,
LINE 165: but pretty well."
LINE 166: "It's more than that, then," said Joe.
LINE 167: That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he
LINE 168: rubbed the arms of his chair, "It's more than that, Mum."
LINE 169: "Why, you don't mean to say—" began my sister.
LINE 170: "Yes I do, Mum," said Pumblechook; "but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good
LINE 171: in you! Go on!"
LINE 172: "What would present company say," proceeded Joe, "to twenty pound?"
LINE 173: "Handsome would be the word," returned my sister.
LINE 174: "Well, then," said Joe, "It's more than twenty pound."
LINE 175: That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a
LINE 176: patronizing laugh, "It's more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her
LINE 177: up, Joseph!"
LINE 178: "Then to make an end of it," said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to
LINE 179: my sister; "it's five-and-twenty pound."
LINE 180: "It's five-and-twenty pound, Mum," echoed that basest of swindlers,
LINE 181: Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; "and it's no more than
LINE 182: your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy
LINE 183: of the money!"
LINE 184: If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently
LINE 185: awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into
LINE 186: custody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality
LINE 187: far behind.
LINE 188: "Now you see, Joseph and wife," said Pumblechook, as he took me by the
LINE 189: arm above the elbow, "I am one of them that always go right through
LINE 190: with what they've begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That's
LINE 191: _my_ way. Bound out of hand."
LINE 192: "Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook," said my sister (grasping the
LINE 193: money), "we're deeply beholden to you."
LINE 194: "Never mind me, Mum," returned that diabolical cornchandler. "A
LINE 195: pleasure's a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we
LINE 196: must have him bound. I said I'd see to it—to tell you the truth."
LINE 197: The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once
LINE 198: went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial
LINE 199: presence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,
LINE 200: exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;
LINE 201: indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken
LINE 202: red-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,
LINE 203: I heard some people say, "What's he done?" and others, "He's a young
LINE 204: 'un, too, but looks bad, don't he?" One person of mild and benevolent
LINE 205: aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent
LINE 206: young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and
LINE 207: entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.
LINE 208: The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a
LINE 209: church,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and with
LINE 210: mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with
LINE 211: folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading
LINE 212: the newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls,
LINE 213: which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
LINE 214: sticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
LINE 215: attested, and I was "bound"; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while
LINE 216: as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little
LINE 217: preliminaries disposed of.
LINE 218: When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been
LINE 219: put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly
LINE 220: tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were
LINE 221: merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's. And there my
LINE 222: sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would
LINE 223: serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue
LINE 224: Boar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring
LINE 225: the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.
LINE 226: It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it
LINE 227: inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole
LINE 228: company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it
LINE 229: worse, they all asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they had
LINE 230: nothing else to do,—why I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I
LINE 231: possibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,—when I wasn't!
LINE 232: However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the
LINE 233: most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent
LINE 234: contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;
LINE 235: and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had
LINE 236: fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I
LINE 237: played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,
LINE 238: or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
LINE 239: to contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair
LINE 240: beside him to illustrate his remarks.
LINE 241: My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they
LINE 242: wouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,
LINE 243: woke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the
LINE 244: evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his bloodstained
LINE 245: sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and
LINE 246: said, "The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it
LINE 247: wasn't the Tumblers' Arms." That, they were all in excellent spirits on
LINE 248: the road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and
LINE 249: asserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive
LINE 250: bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by
LINE 251: wanting to know all about everybody's private affairs) that _he_ was
LINE 252: the man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole
LINE 253: the weakest pilgrim going.
LINE 254: Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly
LINE 255: wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like
LINE 256: Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.
