LINE 1: Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our
LINE 2: debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like
LINE 3: exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a
LINE 4: way of doing; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction,
LINE 5: that I should do so before I knew where I was.
LINE 6: Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had
LINE 7: nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a
LINE 8: profound sensation in Barnard's Inn. But we had looked forward to my
LINE 9: one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and
LINE 10: anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
LINE 11: help saying something definite on that occasion.
LINE 12: I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my
LINE 13: birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from
LINE 14: Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call
LINE 15: upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced
LINE 16: us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual
LINE 17: flutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of
LINE 18: punctuality.
LINE 19: In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and
LINE 20: incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of
LINE 21: tissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting
LINE 22: it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. It was
LINE 23: November, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back
LINE 24: against the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.
LINE 25: "Well, Pip," said he, "I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,
LINE 26: Mr. Pip."
LINE 27: We shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thanked
LINE 28: him.
LINE 29: "Take a chair, Mr. Pip," said my guardian.
LINE 30: As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his
LINE 31: boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time
LINE 32: when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the
LINE 33: shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were
LINE 34: making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.
LINE 35: "Now my young friend," my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the
LINE 36: box, "I am going to have a word or two with you."
LINE 37: "If you please, sir."
LINE 38: "What do you suppose," said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the
LINE 39: ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—"what
LINE 40: do you suppose you are living at the rate of?"
LINE 41: "At the rate of, sir?"
LINE 42: "At," repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,
LINE 43: "the—rate—of?" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his
LINE 44: pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.
LINE 45: I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed
LINE 46: any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,
LINE 47: I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply
LINE 48: seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, "I thought so!" and blew his
LINE 49: nose with an air of satisfaction.
LINE 50: "Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend," said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 51: "Have you anything to ask _me_?"
LINE 52: "Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
LINE 53: questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition."
LINE 54: "Ask one," said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 55: "Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?"
LINE 56: "No. Ask another."
LINE 57: "Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?"
LINE 58: "Waive that, a moment," said Mr. Jaggers, "and ask another."
LINE 59: I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
LINE 60: the inquiry, "Have-I—anything to receive, sir?" On that, Mr. Jaggers
LINE 61: said, triumphantly, "I thought we should come to it!" and called to
LINE 62: Wemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it
LINE 63: in, and disappeared.
LINE 64: "Now, Mr. Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "attend, if you please. You have been
LINE 65: drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's
LINE 66: cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?"
LINE 67: "I am afraid I must say yes, sir."
LINE 68: "You know you must say yes; don't you?" said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 69: "Yes, sir."
LINE 70: "I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did
LINE 71: know, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,"
LINE 72: cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of
LINE 73: protesting: "it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you
LINE 74: would. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this
LINE 75: piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it
LINE 76: and tell me what it is."
LINE 77: "This is a bank-note," said I, "for five hundred pounds."
LINE 78: "That is a bank-note," repeated Mr. Jaggers, "for five hundred pounds.
LINE 79: And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?"
LINE 80: "How could I do otherwise!"
LINE 81: "Ah! But answer the question," said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 82: "Undoubtedly."
LINE 83: "You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that
LINE 84: handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this
LINE 85: day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome
LINE 86: sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until
LINE 87: the donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your
LINE 88: money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from
LINE 89: Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are
LINE 90: in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere
LINE 91: agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my
LINE 92: instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but
LINE 93: I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits."
LINE 94: I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
LINE 95: liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. "I am
LINE 96: not paid, Pip," said he, coolly, "to carry your words to any one;" and
LINE 97: then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and
LINE 98: stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against
LINE 99: him.
LINE 100: After a pause, I hinted,—
LINE 101: "There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to
LINE 102: waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it
LINE 103: again?"
LINE 104: "What is it?" said he.
LINE 105: I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me
LINE 106: aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.
LINE 107: "Is it likely," I said, after hesitating, "that my patron, the
LINE 108: fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—" there I
LINE 109: delicately stopped.
LINE 110: "Will soon what?" asked Mr. Jaggers. "That's no question as it stands,
LINE 111: you know."
LINE 112: "Will soon come to London," said I, after casting about for a precise
LINE 113: form of words, "or summon me anywhere else?"
LINE 114: "Now, here," replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his
LINE 115: dark deep-set eyes, "we must revert to the evening when we first
LINE 116: encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,
LINE 117: Pip?"
LINE 118: "You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that
LINE 119: person appeared."
LINE 120: "Just so," said Mr. Jaggers, "that's my answer."
LINE 121: As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my
LINE 122: strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came
LINE 123: quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I
LINE 124: had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.
LINE 125: "Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?"
LINE 126: Mr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question, but in
LINE 127: altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer
LINE 128: it,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my
LINE 129: eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their
LINE 130: suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.
LINE 131: "Come!" said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs
LINE 132: of his warmed hands, "I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That's a
LINE 133: question I must not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I
LINE 134: tell you it's a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I'll go a
LINE 135: little further with you; I'll say something more."
LINE 136: He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the
LINE 137: calves of his legs in the pause he made.
LINE 138: "When that person discloses," said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,
LINE 139: "you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person
LINE 140: discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that
LINE 141: person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything
LINE 142: about it. And that's all I have got to say."
LINE 143: We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked
LINE 144: thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion
LINE 145: that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him
LINE 146: into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he
LINE 147: resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did
LINE 148: object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I
LINE 149: raised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me
LINE 150: all the time, and was doing so still.
LINE 151: "If that is all you have to say, sir," I remarked, "there can be
LINE 152: nothing left for me to say."
LINE 153: He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me
LINE 154: where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.
LINE 155: As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his
LINE 156: company, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on
LINE 157: walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation
LINE 158: for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had
LINE 159: his hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk
LINE 160: to Wemmick.
LINE 161: The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my
LINE 162: pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there
LINE 163: before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise
LINE 164: with concerning such thought.
LINE 165: He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going
LINE 166: home. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office
LINE 167: candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near
LINE 168: the door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his
LINE 169: hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest
LINE 170: with his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.
LINE 171: "Mr. Wemmick," said I, "I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous
LINE 172: to serve a friend."
LINE 173: Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion
LINE 174: were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.
LINE 175: "This friend," I pursued, "is trying to get on in commercial life, but
LINE 176: has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
LINE 177: beginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning."
LINE 178: "With money down?" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.
LINE 179: "With _some_ money down," I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot
LINE 180: across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—"with _some_
LINE 181: money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations."
LINE 182: "Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, "I should like just to run over with you on my
LINE 183: fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as
LINE 184: Chelsea Reach. Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two;
LINE 185: Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six."
LINE 186: He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his
LINE 187: safe-key on the palm of his hand. "There's as many as six, you see, to
LINE 188: choose from."
LINE 189: "I don't understand you," said I.
LINE 190: "Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip," returned Wemmick, "and take a walk upon
LINE 191: your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch
LINE 192: of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and
LINE 193: you may know the end of it too,—but it's a less pleasant and profitable
LINE 194: end."
LINE 195: I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after
LINE 196: saying this.
LINE 197: "This is very discouraging," said I.
LINE 198: "Meant to be so," said Wemmick.
LINE 199: "Then is it your opinion," I inquired, with some little indignation,
LINE 200: "that a man should never—"
LINE 201: "—Invest portable property in a friend?" said Wemmick. "Certainly he
LINE 202: should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,—and then it
LINE 203: becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get
LINE 204: rid of him."
LINE 205: "And that," said I, "is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?"
LINE 206: "That," he returned, "is my deliberate opinion in this office."
LINE 207: "Ah!" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole
LINE 208: here; "but would that be your opinion at Walworth?"
LINE 209: "Mr. Pip," he replied, with gravity, "Walworth is one place, and this
LINE 210: office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is
LINE 211: another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments
LINE 212: must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken
LINE 213: in this office."
LINE 214: "Very well," said I, much relieved, "then I shall look you up at
LINE 215: Walworth, you may depend upon it."
LINE 216: "Mr. Pip," he returned, "you will be welcome there, in a private and
LINE 217: personal capacity."
LINE 218: We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my
LINE 219: guardian's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in
LINE 220: his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and
LINE 221: stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street
LINE 222: together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.
LINE 223: Jaggers and I turned ours.
LINE 224: I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers
LINE 225: had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a
LINE 226: Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable
LINE 227: consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all
LINE 228: seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
LINE 229: made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
LINE 230: Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to
LINE 231: dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,
LINE 232: because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes
LINE 233: fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and
LINE 234: forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.
