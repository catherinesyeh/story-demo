LINE 1: As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to
LINE 2: notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on
LINE 3: my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,
LINE 4: but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of
LINE 5: chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was
LINE 6: not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the
LINE 7: night,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,
LINE 8: that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss
LINE 9: Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with
LINE 10: Joe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat
LINE 11: alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like
LINE 12: the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.
LINE 13: Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
LINE 14: mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
LINE 15: in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,
LINE 16: and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my
LINE 17: satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the
LINE 18: influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so
LINE 19: I perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to
LINE 20: anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My
LINE 21: lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not
LINE 22: afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace
LINE 23: with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having
LINE 24: unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor
LINE 25: arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,
LINE 26: and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them
LINE 27: slumbering. But Herbert's was a very different case, and it often
LINE 28: caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in
LINE 29: crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery
LINE 30: work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.
LINE 31: So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began
LINE 32: to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must
LINE 33: begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop's suggestion, we put
LINE 34: ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the
LINE 35: Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were
LINE 36: not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to
LINE 37: quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause
LINE 38: six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying
LINE 39: social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I
LINE 40: understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast
LINE 41: of the society: which ran "Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good
LINE 42: feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove."
LINE 43: The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in
LINE 44: Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of
LINE 45: joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about
LINE 46: town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
LINE 47: at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his
LINE 48: equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion
LINE 49: deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like
LINE 50: coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could
LINE 51: not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of
LINE 52: age.
LINE 53: In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken
LINE 54: Herbert's expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make
LINE 55: no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every
LINE 56: direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into
LINE 57: keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him
LINE 58: with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about
LINE 59: him more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into
LINE 60: dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather
LINE 61: clearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards
LINE 62: midnight; and that at about two o'clock in the morning, he became so
LINE 63: deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to
LINE 64: America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his
LINE 65: fortune.
LINE 66: I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at
LINE 67: Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert
LINE 68: would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those
LINE 69: seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
LINE 70: the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the
LINE 71: general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,
LINE 72: was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew
LINE 73: greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by
LINE 74: the hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,
LINE 75: read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about
LINE 76: her grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it
LINE 77: into bed whenever it attracted her notice.
LINE 78: As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of
LINE 79: clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once
LINE 80: completing the description of our usual manners and customs at
LINE 81: Barnard's Inn.
LINE 82: We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people
LINE 83: could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less
LINE 84: miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.
LINE 85: There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
LINE 86: ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my
LINE 87: belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.
LINE 88: Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look
LINE 89: about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he
LINE 90: consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an
LINE 91: almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I
LINE 92: ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we
LINE 93: undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a
LINE 94: Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except
LINE 95: at a certain hour of every afternoon to "go to Lloyd's"—in observance
LINE 96: of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything
LINE 97: else in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back
LINE 98: again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively
LINE 99: must find an opening, he would go on 'Change at a busy time, and walk
LINE 100: in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the
LINE 101: assembled magnates. "For," says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on
LINE 102: one of those special occasions, "I find the truth to be, Handel, that
LINE 103: an opening won't come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been."
LINE 104: If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated
LINE 105: one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond
LINE 106: expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight
LINE 107: of the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a less
LINE 108: remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
LINE 109: four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast
LINE 110: became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at
LINE 111: breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, "not
LINE 112: unwholly unconnected," as my local paper might put it, "with jewelery,"
LINE 113: I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him
LINE 114: off his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted
LINE 115: Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.
LINE 116: At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our
LINE 117: humour—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—
LINE 118: "My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly."
LINE 119: "My dear Handel," Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, "if you
LINE 120: will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange
LINE 121: coincidence."
LINE 122: "Then, Herbert," I would respond, "let us look into our affairs."
LINE 123: We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
LINE 124: this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to
LINE 125: confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And
LINE 126: I know Herbert thought so too.
LINE 127: We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of
LINE 128: something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds
LINE 129: might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the
LINE 130: mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of
LINE 131: ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was
LINE 132: something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.
LINE 133: I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in
LINE 134: a neat hand, the heading, "Memorandum of Pip's debts"; with Barnard's
LINE 135: Inn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet
LINE 136: of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, "Memorandum of
LINE 137: Herbert's debts."
LINE 138: Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,
LINE 139: which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half
LINE 140: burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and
LINE 141: otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us
LINE 142: exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to
LINE 143: distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually
LINE 144: paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things
LINE 145: seemed about equal.
LINE 146: When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?
LINE 147: Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful
LINE 148: manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.
LINE 149: "They are mounting up, Handel," Herbert would say; "upon my life, they
LINE 150: are mounting up."
LINE 151: "Be firm, Herbert," I would retort, plying my own pen with great
LINE 152: assiduity. "Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare
LINE 153: them out of countenance."
LINE 154: "So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance."
LINE 155: However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would
LINE 156: fall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the
LINE 157: plea that he had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the
LINE 158: case might be.
LINE 159: "Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it
LINE 160: down."
LINE 161: "What a fellow of resource you are!" my friend would reply, with
LINE 162: admiration. "Really your business powers are very remarkable."
LINE 163: I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the
LINE 164: reputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,
LINE 165: energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities
LINE 166: down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My
LINE 167: self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.
LINE 168: When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,
LINE 169: docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical
LINE 170: bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not
LINE 171: my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into
LINE 172: a focus for him.
LINE 173: My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called
LINE 174: "leaving a Margin." For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one
LINE 175: hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, "Leave a
LINE 176: margin, and put them down at two hundred." Or, supposing my own to be
LINE 177: four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven
LINE 178: hundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,
LINE 179: but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have
LINE 180: been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,
LINE 181: to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of
LINE 182: freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another
LINE 183: margin.
LINE 184: But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these
LINE 185: examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable
LINE 186: opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's
LINE 187: compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the
LINE 188: table before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some
LINE 189: sort, rather than a private individual.
LINE 190: We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we
LINE 191: might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one
LINE 192: evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said
LINE 193: door, and fall on the ground. "It's for you, Handel," said Herbert,
LINE 194: going out and coming back with it, "and I hope there is nothing the
LINE 195: matter." This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.
LINE 196: The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I
LINE 197: was an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.
LINE 198: Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past
LINE 199: six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the
LINE 200: interment on Monday next at three o'clock in the afternoon.
