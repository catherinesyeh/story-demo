LINE 1: In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately
LINE 2: beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was
LINE 3: more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I
LINE 4: thought I saw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.
LINE 5: We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and
LINE 6: when it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but
LINE 7: herself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination.
LINE 8: "I am going to Richmond," she told me. "Our lesson is, that there are
LINE 9: two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the
LINE 10: Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,
LINE 11: and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges
LINE 12: out of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,
LINE 13: but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own
LINE 14: devices, you and I."
LINE 15: As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner
LINE 16: meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with
LINE 17: displeasure.
LINE 18: "A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a
LINE 19: little?"
LINE 20: "Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you
LINE 21: are to take care of me the while."
LINE 22: She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a
LINE 23: waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
LINE 24: such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,
LINE 25: he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he
LINE 26: couldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the
LINE 27: establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous
LINE 28: article, considering the hole's proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,
LINE 29: and somebody's pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us
LINE 30: into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a
LINE 31: scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked
LINE 32: at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;
LINE 33: which, proving to be merely, "Some tea for the lady," sent him out of
LINE 34: the room in a very low state of mind.
LINE 35: I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong
LINE 36: combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that
LINE 37: the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising
LINE 38: proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.
LINE 39: Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that
LINE 40: with her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all
LINE 41: happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)
LINE 42: "Where are you going to, at Richmond?" I asked Estella.
LINE 43: "I am going to live," said she, "at a great expense, with a lady there,
LINE 44: who has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducing
LINE 45: me, and showing people to me and showing me to people."
LINE 46: "I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?"
LINE 47: "Yes, I suppose so."
LINE 48: She answered so carelessly, that I said, "You speak of yourself as if
LINE 49: you were some one else."
LINE 50: "Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come," said Estella,
LINE 51: smiling delightfully, "you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;
LINE 52: I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?"
LINE 53: "I live quite pleasantly there; at least—" It appeared to me that I was
LINE 54: losing a chance.
LINE 55: "At least?" repeated Estella.
LINE 56: "As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you."
LINE 57: "You silly boy," said Estella, quite composedly, "how can you talk such
LINE 58: nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest
LINE 59: of his family?"
LINE 60: "Very superior indeed. He is nobody's enemy—"
LINE 61: "Don't add but his own," interposed Estella, "for I hate that class of
LINE 62: man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and
LINE 63: spite, I have heard?"
LINE 64: "I am sure I have every reason to say so."
LINE 65: "You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people," said
LINE 66: Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
LINE 67: grave and rallying, "for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and
LINE 68: insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,
LINE 69: write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment
LINE 70: and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself
LINE 71: the hatred those people feel for you."
LINE 72: "They do me no harm, I hope?"
LINE 73: Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very
LINE 74: singular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When
LINE 75: she left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with real
LINE 76: enjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her,—
LINE 77: "I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
LINE 78: harm."
LINE 79: "No, no you may be sure of that," said Estella. "You may be certain
LINE 80: that I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and
LINE 81: the tortures they undergo!" She laughed again, and even now when she
LINE 82: had told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not
LINE 83: doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I
LINE 84: thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw
LINE 85: the thought in my mind, and answered it.
LINE 86: "It is not easy for even you." said Estella, "to know what satisfaction
LINE 87: it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of
LINE 88: the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not
LINE 89: brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not
LINE 90: your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed
LINE 91: and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that
LINE 92: is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round
LINE 93: childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
LINE 94: woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up
LINE 95: in the night. I did."
LINE 96: It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these
LINE 97: remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of
LINE 98: that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.
LINE 99: "Two things I can tell you," said Estella. "First, notwithstanding the
LINE 100: proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your
LINE 101: mind at rest that these people never will—never would in a hundred
LINE 102: years—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great
LINE 103: or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
LINE 104: busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it."
LINE 105: As she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been but
LINE 106: momentary—I held it and put it to my lips. "You ridiculous boy," said
LINE 107: Estella, "will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the
LINE 108: same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?"
LINE 109: "What spirit was that?" said I.
LINE 110: "I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and
LINE 111: plotters."
LINE 112: "If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?"
LINE 113: "You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you
LINE 114: like."
LINE 115: I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue's. "Now," said
LINE 116: Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, "you are to take
LINE 117: care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond."
LINE 118: Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,
LINE 119: and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our
LINE 120: intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,
LINE 121: I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on
LINE 122: against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it
LINE 123: always was.
LINE 124: I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,
LINE 125: brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of
LINE 126: tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and
LINE 127: forks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek
LINE 128: little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron
LINE 129: cover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a
LINE 130: quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof
LINE 131: impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of
LINE 132: bread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in
LINE 133: with, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a
LINE 134: prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came
LINE 135: back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I
LINE 136: steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances
LINE 137: extracted one cup of I don't know what for Estella.
LINE 138: The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,
LINE 139: and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole
LINE 140: house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's
LINE 141: purse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away.
LINE 142: Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon
LINE 143: under the walls of which I was so ashamed.
LINE 144: "What place is that?" Estella asked me.
LINE 145: I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told
LINE 146: her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,
LINE 147: "Wretches!" I would not have confessed to my visit for any
LINE 148: consideration.
LINE 149: "Mr. Jaggers," said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,
LINE 150: "has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
LINE 151: than any man in London."
LINE 152: "He is more in the secrets of every place, I think," said Estella, in a
LINE 153: low voice.
LINE 154: "You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?"
LINE 155: "I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I
LINE 156: can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could
LINE 157: speak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with
LINE 158: him?"
LINE 159: "Once habituated to his distrustful manner," said I, "I have done very
LINE 160: well."
LINE 161: "Are you intimate?"
LINE 162: "I have dined with him at his private house."
LINE 163: "I fancy," said Estella, shrinking "that must be a curious place."
LINE 164: "It is a curious place."
LINE 165: I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
LINE 166: her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
LINE 167: the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden
LINE 168: glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive
LINE 169: with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out
LINE 170: of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in
LINE 171: lightning.
LINE 172: So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by
LINE 173: which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this
LINE 174: side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she
LINE 175: told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham's neighbourhood until she
LINE 176: had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in
LINE 177: going and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her
LINE 178: while she remained here? To that she emphatically said "God forbid!"
LINE 179: and no more.
LINE 180: It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;
LINE 181: that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task
LINE 182: had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she
LINE 183: had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should
LINE 184: have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose
LINE 185: to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to
LINE 186: crush it and throw it away.
LINE 187: When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew
LINE 188: Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I
LINE 189: hoped I should see her sometimes.
LINE 190: "O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you
LINE 191: are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned."
LINE 192: I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?
LINE 193: "No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of
LINE 194: some station, though not averse to increasing her income."
LINE 195: "I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon."
LINE 196: "It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip," said Estella, with
LINE 197: a sigh, as if she were tired; "I am to write to her constantly and see
LINE 198: her regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are
LINE 199: nearly all mine now."
LINE 200: It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she
LINE 201: did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.
LINE 202: We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house
LINE 203: by the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,
LINE 204: embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their
LINE 205: court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still
LINE 206: cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
LINE 207: stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of
LINE 208: the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go
LINE 209: the silent way of the rest.
LINE 210: A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to
LINE 211: the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted
LINE 212: sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded
LINE 213: gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering
LINE 214: out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she
LINE 215: gave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed
LINE 216: likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I
LINE 217: should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy
LINE 218: with her, but always miserable.
LINE 219: I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in
LINE 220: with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our
LINE 221: own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party
LINE 222: escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite
LINE 223: of his being subject to Flopson.
LINE 224: Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on
LINE 225: domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and
LINE 226: servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But
LINE 227: Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of
LINE 228: the baby's having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him
LINE 229: quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot
LINE 230: Guards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be
LINE 231: regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either
LINE 232: to apply externally or to take as a tonic.
LINE 233: Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
LINE 234: advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
LINE 235: highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging
LINE 236: him to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as
LINE 237: she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a
LINE 238: sovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn't.
