LINE 1: Putting Miss Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as my
LINE 2: credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her
LINE 3: waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I
LINE 4: went down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway
LINE 5: House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for
LINE 6: I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to
LINE 7: leave it in the same manner.
LINE 8: The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet
LINE 9: echoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old
LINE 10: monks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong
LINE 11: walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,
LINE 12: were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral
LINE 13: chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried
LINE 14: on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell
LINE 15: of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the
LINE 16: rooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high
LINE 17: trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was
LINE 18: changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.
LINE 19: An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who
LINE 20: lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the
LINE 21: gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,
LINE 22: and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was
LINE 23: not in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.
LINE 24: Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on
LINE 25: the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the
LINE 26: contemplation of, the ashy fire.
LINE 27: Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old
LINE 28: chimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There
LINE 29: was an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to
LINE 30: pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could
LINE 31: charge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in
LINE 32: the progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked
LINE 33: fortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in
LINE 34: a low voice, "Is it real?"
LINE 35: "It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost
LINE 36: no time."
LINE 37: "Thank you. Thank you."
LINE 38: As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I
LINE 39: remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.
LINE 40: "I want," she said, "to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when
LINE 41: you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But
LINE 42: perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my
LINE 43: heart?"
LINE 44: When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous
LINE 45: right hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it
LINE 46: again before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.
LINE 47: "You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do
LINE 48: something useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it
LINE 49: not?"
LINE 50: "Something that I would like done very much."
LINE 51: "What is it?"
LINE 52: I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had
LINE 53: not got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking
LINE 54: in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be
LINE 55: so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed
LINE 56: that she was conscious of the fact.
LINE 57: "Do you break off," she asked then, with her former air of being afraid
LINE 58: of me, "because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?"
LINE 59: "No, no," I answered, "how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped
LINE 60: because I thought you were not following what I said."
LINE 61: "Perhaps I was not," she answered, putting a hand to her head. "Begin
LINE 62: again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me."
LINE 63: She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
LINE 64: habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
LINE 65: forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her
LINE 66: how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in
LINE 67: this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)
LINE 68: involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they
LINE 69: were the weighty secrets of another.
LINE 70: "So!" said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. "And
LINE 71: how much money is wanting to complete the purchase?"
LINE 72: I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. "Nine
LINE 73: hundred pounds."
LINE 74: "If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as
LINE 75: you have kept your own?"
LINE 76: "Quite as faithfully."
LINE 77: "And your mind will be more at rest?"
LINE 78: "Much more at rest."
LINE 79: "Are you very unhappy now?"
LINE 80: She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an
LINE 81: unwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my
LINE 82: voice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and
LINE 83: softly laid her forehead on it.
LINE 84: "I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of
LINE 85: disquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned."
LINE 86: After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire
LINE 87: again.
LINE 88: "It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
LINE 89: unhappiness. Is it true?"
LINE 90: "Too true."
LINE 91: "Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as
LINE 92: done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?"
LINE 93: "Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the
LINE 94: tone of the question. But there is nothing."
LINE 95: She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room
LINE 96: for the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her
LINE 97: pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and
LINE 98: wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung
LINE 99: from her neck.
LINE 100: "You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?"
LINE 101: "Quite. I dined with him yesterday."
LINE 102: "This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your
LINE 103: irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if
LINE 104: you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it
LINE 105: to you."
LINE 106: "Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving
LINE 107: it from him."
LINE 108: She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and
LINE 109: evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
LINE 110: receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled
LINE 111: again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
LINE 112: pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without
LINE 113: looking at me.
LINE 114: "My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, "I
LINE 115: forgive her," though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
LINE 116: it!"
LINE 117: "O Miss Havisham," said I, "I can do it now. There have been sore
LINE 118: mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want
LINE 119: forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you."
LINE 120: She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,
LINE 121: and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees
LINE 122: at my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,
LINE 123: when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have
LINE 124: been raised to heaven from her mother's side.
LINE 125: To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet
LINE 126: gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got
LINE 127: my arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of
LINE 128: mine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and
LINE 129: wept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that
LINE 130: the relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was
LINE 131: not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.
LINE 132: "O!" she cried, despairingly. "What have I done! What have I done!"
LINE 133: "If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me
LINE 134: answer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.
LINE 135: Is she married?"
LINE 136: "Yes."
LINE 137: It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house
LINE 138: had told me so.
LINE 139: "What have I done! What have I done!" She wrung her hands, and crushed
LINE 140: her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. "What
LINE 141: have I done!"
LINE 142: I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a
LINE 143: grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
LINE 144: that her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found
LINE 145: vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of
LINE 146: day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had
LINE 147: secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,
LINE 148: her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and
LINE 149: must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew
LINE 150: equally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her
LINE 151: punishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this
LINE 152: earth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become
LINE 153: a master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,
LINE 154: the vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been
LINE 155: curses in this world?
LINE 156: "Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a
LINE 157: looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know
LINE 158: what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!" And so again,
LINE 159: twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!
LINE 160: "Miss Havisham," I said, when her cry had died away, "you may dismiss
LINE 161: me from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and
LINE 162: if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
LINE 163: part of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that
LINE 164: than to bemoan the past through a hundred years."
LINE 165: "Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip—my dear!" There was an earnest womanly
LINE 166: compassion for me in her new affection. "My dear! Believe this: when
LINE 167: she first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At
LINE 168: first, I meant no more."
LINE 169: "Well, well!" said I. "I hope so."
LINE 170: "But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did
LINE 171: worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,
LINE 172: and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and
LINE 173: point my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place."
LINE 174: "Better," I could not help saying, "to have left her a natural heart,
LINE 175: even to be bruised or broken."
LINE 176: With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and
LINE 177: then burst out again, What had she done!
LINE 178: "If you knew all my story," she pleaded, "you would have some
LINE 179: compassion for me and a better understanding of me."
LINE 180: "Miss Havisham," I answered, as delicately as I could, "I believe I may
LINE 181: say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first
LINE 182: left this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,
LINE 183: and I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed
LINE 184: between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to
LINE 185: Estella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?"
LINE 186: She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and
LINE 187: her head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and
LINE 188: replied, "Go on."
LINE 189: "Whose child was Estella?"
LINE 190: She shook her head.
LINE 191: "You don't know?"
LINE 192: She shook her head again.
LINE 193: "But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?"
LINE 194: "Brought her here."
LINE 195: "Will you tell me how that came about?"
LINE 196: She answered in a low whisper and with caution: "I had been shut up in
LINE 197: these rooms a long time (I don't know how long; you know what time the
LINE 198: clocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear
LINE 199: and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for
LINE 200: him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the
LINE 201: newspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would
LINE 202: look about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here
LINE 203: asleep, and I called her Estella."
LINE 204: "Might I ask her age then?"
LINE 205: "Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an
LINE 206: orphan and I adopted her."
LINE 207: So convinced I was of that woman's being her mother, that I wanted no
LINE 208: evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I
LINE 209: thought, the connection here was clear and straight.
LINE 210: What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had
LINE 211: succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew
LINE 212: of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No
LINE 213: matter with what other words we parted; we parted.
LINE 214: Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I
LINE 215: called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I
LINE 216: would not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before
LINE 217: leaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,
LINE 218: and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.
LINE 219: By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which
LINE 220: the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and
LINE 221: leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
LINE 222: end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by
LINE 223: the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the
LINE 224: paths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary
LINE 225: all!
LINE 226: Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little
LINE 227: door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at
LINE 228: the opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started
LINE 229: and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was
LINE 230: encumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back.
LINE 231: A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of
LINE 232: the slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to
LINE 233: the beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam
LINE 234: shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to be
LINE 235: sure I was there in an instant.
LINE 236: The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this
LINE 237: illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an
LINE 238: indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I
LINE 239: had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on
LINE 240: into the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let
LINE 241: me out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go
LINE 242: upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I
LINE 243: had left her. I took the latter course and went up.
LINE 244: I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in
LINE 245: the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back
LINE 246: towards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly
LINE 247: away, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw
LINE 248: her running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about
LINE 249: her, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.
LINE 250: I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.
LINE 251: That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over
LINE 252: her; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same
LINE 253: purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,
LINE 254: and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the
LINE 255: ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered
LINE 256: her, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,—that this
LINE 257: occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or
LINE 258: thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the
LINE 259: floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were
LINE 260: floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded
LINE 261: bridal dress.
LINE 262: Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
LINE 263: away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries
LINE 264: at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like
LINE 265: a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or
LINE 266: why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the
LINE 267: flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her
LINE 268: garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.
LINE 269: She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even
LINE 270: touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I
LINE 271: unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire
LINE 272: would break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon's
LINE 273: coming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my
LINE 274: hands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of
LINE 275: feeling.
LINE 276: On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,
LINE 277: but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay
LINE 278: mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon's directions, her bed was
LINE 279: carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to
LINE 280: be well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,
LINE 281: an hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her
LINE 282: stick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.
LINE 283: Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still
LINE 284: had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had
LINE 285: covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a
LINE 286: white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that
LINE 287: had been and was changed was still upon her.
LINE 288: I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I
LINE 289: got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next
LINE 290: post. Miss Havisham's family I took upon myself; intending to
LINE 291: communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he
LINE 292: liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,
LINE 293: as soon as I returned to town.
LINE 294: There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had
LINE 295: happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she
LINE 296: began to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that
LINE 297: she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, "What have I done!"
LINE 298: And then, "When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like
LINE 299: mine." And then, "Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive
LINE 300: her!'" She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she
LINE 301: sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in
LINE 302: another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.
LINE 303: As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that
LINE 304: pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could
LINE 305: not drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I
LINE 306: would return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and
LINE 307: being taken up clear of the town. At about six o'clock of the morning,
LINE 308: therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as
LINE 309: they said, not stopping for being touched, "Take the pencil and write
LINE 310: under my name, 'I forgive her.'"
