LINE 1: It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed
LINE 2: lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there
LINE 3: was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large
LINE 4: moon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in
LINE 5: among the piled mountains of cloud.
LINE 6: There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A
LINE 7: stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were
LINE 8: so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew
LINE 9: them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had
LINE 10: no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my
LINE 11: inclination, I went on against it.
LINE 12: The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor
LINE 13: that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards
LINE 14: the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old
LINE 15: lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew
LINE 16: the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles
LINE 17: apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,
LINE 18: there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two
LINE 19: bright specks.
LINE 20: At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand
LINE 21: still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose
LINE 22: and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while
LINE 23: I seemed to have the whole flats to myself.
LINE 24: It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was
LINE 25: burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and
LINE 26: left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It
LINE 27: lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the
LINE 28: tools and barrows that were lying about.
LINE 29: Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rude
LINE 30: path lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened
LINE 31: my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,
LINE 32: I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,
LINE 33: and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against
LINE 34: the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and
LINE 35: ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln
LINE 36: crept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I
LINE 37: knocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.
LINE 38: It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a
LINE 39: lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle
LINE 40: bedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, "Is there any one here?"
LINE 41: but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it
LINE 42: was past nine, called again, "Is there any one here?" There being still
LINE 43: no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.
LINE 44: It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen
LINE 45: already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the
LINE 46: shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was
LINE 47: considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be
LINE 48: coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head
LINE 49: to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken
LINE 50: up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent
LINE 51: shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in
LINE 52: a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.
LINE 53: "Now," said a suppressed voice with an oath, "I've got you!"
LINE 54: "What is this?" I cried, struggling. "Who is it? Help, help, help!"
LINE 55: Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my
LINE 56: bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man's hand,
LINE 57: sometimes a strong man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my
LINE 58: cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled
LINE 59: ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. "And
LINE 60: now," said the suppressed voice with another oath, "call out again, and
LINE 61: I'll make short work of you!"
LINE 62: Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the
LINE 63: surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
LINE 64: execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.
LINE 65: But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt
LINE 66: before, it were now being boiled.
LINE 67: The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black
LINE 68: darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
LINE 69: After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he
LINE 70: wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the
LINE 71: sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and
LINE 72: breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue
LINE 73: point of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,—no
LINE 74: wonder there,—and one after another the sparks died out.
LINE 75: The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As
LINE 76: the sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and
LINE 77: touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending
LINE 78: over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,
LINE 79: breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and
LINE 80: showed me Orlick.
LINE 81: Whom I had looked for, I don't know. I had not looked for him. Seeing
LINE 82: him, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes
LINE 83: upon him.
LINE 84: He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,
LINE 85: and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away
LINE 86: from him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms
LINE 87: folded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to
LINE 88: a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,—a fixture
LINE 89: there,—the means of ascent to the loft above.
LINE 90: "Now," said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, "I've
LINE 91: got you."
LINE 92: "Unbind me. Let me go!"
LINE 93: "Ah!" he returned, "_I_'ll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon,
LINE 94: I'll let you go to the stars. All in good time."
LINE 95: "Why have you lured me here?"
LINE 96: "Don't you know?" said he, with a deadly look.
LINE 97: "Why have you set upon me in the dark?"
LINE 98: "Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than
LINE 99: two. O you enemy, you enemy!"
LINE 100: His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms
LINE 101: folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a
LINE 102: malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, he
LINE 103: put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a
LINE 104: brass-bound stock.
LINE 105: "Do you know this?" said he, making as if he would take aim at me. "Do
LINE 106: you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!"
LINE 107: "Yes," I answered.
LINE 108: [Illustration]
LINE 109: "You cost me that place. You did. Speak!"
LINE 110: "What else could I do?"
LINE 111: "You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to
LINE 112: come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?"
LINE 113: "When did I?"
LINE 114: "When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to
LINE 115: her."
LINE 116: "You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done
LINE 117: you no harm, if you had done yourself none."
LINE 118: "You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to
LINE 119: drive me out of this country, will you?" said he, repeating my words to
LINE 120: Biddy in the last interview I had with her. "Now, I'll tell you a piece
LINE 121: of information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of
LINE 122: this country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty
LINE 123: times told, to the last brass farden!" As he shook his heavy hand at
LINE 124: me, with his mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.
LINE 125: "What are you going to do to me?"
LINE 126: "I'm a-going," said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a
LINE 127: heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,—"I'm
LINE 128: a-going to have your life!"
LINE 129: He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it
LINE 130: across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.
LINE 131: "You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child. You
LINE 132: goes out of his way this present night. He'll have no more on you.
LINE 133: You're dead."
LINE 134: I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked
LINE 135: wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.
LINE 136: "More than that," said he, folding his arms on the table again, "I
LINE 137: won't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth.
LINE 138: I'll put your body in the kiln,—I'd carry two such to it, on my
LINE 139: shoulders—and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall
LINE 140: never know nothing."
LINE 141: My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
LINE 142: of such a death. Estella's father would believe I had deserted him,
LINE 143: would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,
LINE 144: when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had
LINE 145: called at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would
LINE 146: never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I
LINE 147: had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed
LINE 148: through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible
LINE 149: than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so
LINE 150: quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn
LINE 151: generations,—Estella's children, and their children,—while the wretch's
LINE 152: words were yet on his lips.
LINE 153: "Now, wolf," said he, "afore I kill you like any other beast,—which is
LINE 154: wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,—I'll have a good look
LINE 155: at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!"
LINE 156: It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few
LINE 157: could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the
LINE 158: hopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by
LINE 159: a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I
LINE 160: resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some
LINE 161: last poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
LINE 162: men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of
LINE 163: Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no
LINE 164: farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
LINE 165: me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my
LINE 166: miserable errors,—still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I
LINE 167: would have done it.
LINE 168: He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his
LINE 169: neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink
LINE 170: slung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and
LINE 171: took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw
LINE 172: flash into his face.
LINE 173: "Wolf!" said he, folding his arms again, "Old Orlick's a-going to tell
LINE 174: you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister."
LINE 175: Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted
LINE 176: the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her
LINE 177: death, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.
LINE 178: "It was you, villain," said I.
LINE 179: "I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you," he
LINE 180: retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the
LINE 181: vacant air between us. "I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you
LINE 182: to-night. _I_ giv' it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a
LINE 183: limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn't have come
LINE 184: to life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was
LINE 185: favoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
LINE 186: Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it."
LINE 187: He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the
LINE 188: bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly
LINE 189: understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an
LINE 190: end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew
LINE 191: that when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept
LINE 192: towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he
LINE 193: would do as he had done in my sister's case,—make all haste to the
LINE 194: town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My
LINE 195: rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with
LINE 196: him in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and
LINE 197: the white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.
LINE 198: It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years
LINE 199: while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented
LINE 200: pictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of
LINE 201: my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons
LINE 202: without seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of
LINE 203: these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him
LINE 204: himself,—who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!—that
LINE 205: I knew of the slightest action of his fingers.
LINE 206: When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he
LINE 207: sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,
LINE 208: shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,
LINE 209: stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.
LINE 210: "Wolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled
LINE 211: over on your stairs that night."
LINE 212: I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of
LINE 213: the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall. I
LINE 214: saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;
LINE 215: there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.
LINE 216: "And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf. You
LINE 217: and her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as
LINE 218: getting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions,
LINE 219: and new masters. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em
LINE 220: wrote,—do you mind?—writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;
LINE 221: they're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I've had a firm mind
LINE 222: and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your
LINE 223: sister's burying. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked
LINE 224: arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,
LINE 225: 'Somehow or another I'll have him!' What! When I looks for you, I finds
LINE 226: your uncle Provis, eh?"
LINE 227: Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,
LINE 228: all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was
LINE 229: over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his
LINE 230: back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running
LINE 231: out to sea!
LINE 232: "_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so
LINE 233: small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and
LINE 234: thumb and chucked you away dead (as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times,
LINE 235: when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you
LINE 236: hadn't found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for
LINE 237: to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old
LINE 238: Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year
LINE 239: ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a
LINE 240: bullock, as he means to drop you—hey?—when he come for to hear
LINE 241: that—hey?"
LINE 242: In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I
LINE 243: turned my face aside to save it from the flame.
LINE 244: "Ah!" he cried, laughing, after doing it again, "the burnt child dreads
LINE 245: the fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was
LINE 246: smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and
LINE 247: know'd you'd come to-night! Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and
LINE 248: this ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis
LINE 249: as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him 'ware them, when he's lost his
LINE 250: nevvy! Let him 'ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his dear
LINE 251: relation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There's them that can't
LINE 252: and that won't have Magwitch,—yes, _I_ know the name!—alive in the same
LINE 253: land with them, and that's had such sure information of him when he was
LINE 254: alive in another land, as that he couldn't and shouldn't leave it
LINE 255: unbeknown and put them in danger. P'raps it's them that writes fifty
LINE 256: hands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. 'Ware
LINE 257: Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!"
LINE 258: He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an
LINE 259: instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the
LINE 260: light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and
LINE 261: Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.
LINE 262: There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the
LINE 263: opposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and
LINE 264: forwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever
LINE 265: before, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his
LINE 266: sides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.
LINE 267: Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures
LINE 268: that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand
LINE 269: that, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely
LINE 270: perishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what
LINE 271: he had told.
LINE 272: Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it
LINE 273: away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed
LINE 274: slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked
LINE 275: at me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of
LINE 276: his hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and
LINE 277: swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw
LINE 278: in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.
LINE 279: The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one
LINE 280: vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and
LINE 281: struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I
LINE 282: could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until
LINE 283: then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard
LINE 284: responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the
LINE 285: door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of
LINE 286: men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly
LINE 287: out into the night.
LINE 288: After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the
LINE 289: same place, with my head on some one's knee. My eyes were fixed on the
LINE 290: ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on it before
LINE 291: my mind saw it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I
LINE 292: was in the place where I had lost it.
LINE 293: Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who
LINE 294: supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came
LINE 295: between me and it a face. The face of Trabb's boy!
LINE 296: "I think he's all right!" said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; "but
LINE 297: ain't he just pale though!"
LINE 298: At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,
LINE 299: and I saw my supporter to be—
LINE 300: "Herbert! Great Heaven!"
LINE 301: "Softly," said Herbert. "Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager."
LINE 302: "And our old comrade, Startop!" I cried, as he too bent over me.
LINE 303: "Remember what he is going to assist us in," said Herbert, "and be
LINE 304: calm."
LINE 305: The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in
LINE 306: my arm. "The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is
LINE 307: to-night? How long have I been here?" For, I had a strange and strong
LINE 308: misgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and a
LINE 309: night,—two days and nights,—more.
LINE 310: "The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night."
LINE 311: "Thank God!"
LINE 312: "And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in," said Herbert. "But
LINE 313: you can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can
LINE 314: you stand?"
LINE 315: "Yes, yes," said I, "I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing
LINE 316: arm."
LINE 317: They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen
LINE 318: and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they
LINE 319: tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully
LINE 320: replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain
LINE 321: some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the
LINE 322: door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the
LINE 323: quarry on our way back. Trabb's boy—Trabb's overgrown young man
LINE 324: now—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come
LINE 325: in at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I
LINE 326: had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.
LINE 327: The white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as
LINE 328: I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.
LINE 329: Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which at
LINE 330: first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining
LINE 331: quiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our
LINE 332: chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had
LINE 333: met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was
LINE 334: gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the
LINE 335: inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His
LINE 336: uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an
LINE 337: hour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who
LINE 338: volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.
LINE 339: Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his
LINE 340: uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he
LINE 341: resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the
LINE 342: Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,
LINE 343: finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.
LINE 344: Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when
LINE 345: I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh
LINE 346: themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.
LINE 347: Among the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's
LINE 348: Boy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he
LINE 349: had no business,—and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss
LINE 350: Havisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became
LINE 351: their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by
LINE 352: the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went
LINE 353: along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought
LINE 354: there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's
LINE 355: safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be
LINE 356: mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and
LINE 357: went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,
LINE 358: endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could
LINE 359: hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was
LINE 360: while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I
LINE 361: was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,
LINE 362: and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.
LINE 363: When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our
LINE 364: immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it
LINE 365: was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such
LINE 366: a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be
LINE 367: fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we
LINE 368: relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the
LINE 369: present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather
LINE 370: light of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have
LINE 371: been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his
LINE 372: intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb's boy was of a
LINE 373: malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it
LINE 374: was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's
LINE 375: expense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed
LINE 376: to meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an
LINE 377: ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).
LINE 378: Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London
LINE 379: that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be
LINE 380: clear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of. Herbert
LINE 381: got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this
LINE 382: stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear
LINE 383: its pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,
LINE 384: and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.
LINE 385: My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for
LINE 386: to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of
LINE 387: itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the
LINE 388: mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon
LINE 389: me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with
LINE 390: such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.
LINE 391: No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from
LINE 392: communication with him that day; yet this again increased my
LINE 393: restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing
LINE 394: that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me
LINE 395: so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was
LINE 396: something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the
LINE 397: fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days
LINE 398: wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,
LINE 399: my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow
LINE 400: morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning
LINE 401: head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to
LINE 402: high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew
LINE 403: in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
LINE 404: fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to
LINE 405: myself with a start, "Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!"
LINE 406: They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,
LINE 407: and gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the
LINE 408: notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and
LINE 409: the opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed
LINE 410: and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for
LINE 411: four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last
LINE 412: self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept
LINE 413: soundly.
LINE 414: Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking
LINE 415: lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a
LINE 416: marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was
LINE 417: spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there
LINE 418: at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the
LINE 419: clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the
LINE 420: unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn
LINE 421: from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.
LINE 422: From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.
LINE 423: Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on
LINE 424: the sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the
LINE 425: fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In
LINE 426: good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the
LINE 427: sharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still
LINE 428: flowing towards us.
LINE 429: "When it turns at nine o'clock," said Herbert, cheerfully, "look out
LINE 430: for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!"
