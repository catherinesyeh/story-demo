LINE 1: Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made
LINE 2: the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney
LINE 3: chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed
LINE 4: was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the
LINE 5: chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next
LINE 6: in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in
LINE 7: order on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the
LINE 8: back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling
LINE 9: over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the
LINE 10: fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched
LINE 11: little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.
LINE 12: As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,
LINE 13: before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those
LINE 14: virtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which
LINE 15: instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever
LINE 16: be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the
LINE 17: bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a
LINE 18: staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and
LINE 19: lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more
LINE 20: close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.
LINE 21: And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one
LINE 22: another.
LINE 23: What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an
LINE 24: inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I
LINE 25: looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a
LINE 26: number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the
LINE 27: market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying
LINE 28: by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever
LINE 29: tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a
LINE 30: disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable
LINE 31: approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those
LINE 32: extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
LINE 33: audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little
LINE 34: washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the
LINE 35: chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired
LINE 36: a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw
LINE 37: written, DON'T GO HOME.
LINE 38: Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never
LINE 39: warded off this DON'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I
LINE 40: thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had
LINE 41: read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums
LINE 42: in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had
LINE 43: been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that
LINE 44: he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to
LINE 45: assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door
LINE 46: to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship
LINE 47: of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But
LINE 48: all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,
LINE 49: and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were
LINE 50: questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed
LINE 51: there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I
LINE 52: thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I
LINE 53: recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and
LINE 54: tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I was
LINE 55: pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don't go home.
LINE 56: When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a
LINE 57: vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present
LINE 58: tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do
LINE 59: not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may
LINE 60: not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and
LINE 61: should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and
LINE 62: rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the
LINE 63: wall again.
LINE 64: I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was
LINE 65: plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally
LINE 66: plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could
LINE 67: be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had
LINE 68: been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to
LINE 69: startle me from my uneasy bed.
LINE 70: The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock. The little
LINE 71: servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I
LINE 72: passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,
LINE 73: and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was
LINE 74: making tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a
LINE 75: perspective view of the Aged in bed.
LINE 76: "Halloa, Mr. Pip!" said Wemmick. "You did come home, then?"
LINE 77: "Yes," I returned; "but I didn't go home."
LINE 78: "That's all right," said he, rubbing his hands. "I left a note for you
LINE 79: at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come
LINE 80: to?"
LINE 81: I told him.
LINE 82: "I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
LINE 83: notes," said Wemmick; "it's a good rule never to leave documentary
LINE 84: evidence if you can help it, because you don't know when it may be put
LINE 85: in. I'm going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting
LINE 86: this sausage for the Aged P.?"
LINE 87: I said I should be delighted to do it.
LINE 88: "Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne," said Wemmick to the
LINE 89: little servant; "which leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, Mr. Pip?"
LINE 90: he added, winking, as she disappeared.
LINE 91: I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse
LINE 92: proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he
LINE 93: buttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.
LINE 94: "Now, Mr. Pip, you know," said Wemmick, "you and I understand one
LINE 95: another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have
LINE 96: been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official
LINE 97: sentiments are one thing. We are extra official."
LINE 98: I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted
LINE 99: the Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.
LINE 100: "I accidentally heard, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "being in a
LINE 101: certain place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it's as
LINE 102: well not to mention names when avoidable—"
LINE 103: "Much better not," said I. "I understand you."
LINE 104: "I heard there by chance, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "that a
LINE 105: certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not
LINE 106: unpossessed of portable property,—I don't know who it may really be,—we
LINE 107: won't name this person—"
LINE 108: "Not necessary," said I.
LINE 109: "—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
LINE 110: many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,
LINE 111: and not quite irrespective of the government expense—"
LINE 112: In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage,
LINE 113: and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which
LINE 114: I apologised.
LINE 115: "—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of
LINE 116: thereabouts. From which," said Wemmick, "conjectures had been raised
LINE 117: and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden
LINE 118: Court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again."
LINE 119: "By whom?" said I.
LINE 120: "I wouldn't go into that," said Wemmick, evasively, "it might clash
LINE 121: with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard
LINE 122: other curious things in the same place. I don't tell it you on
LINE 123: information received. I heard it."
LINE 124: He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set
LINE 125: forth the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing
LINE 126: it before him, he went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth,
LINE 127: and tied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and propped him up,
LINE 128: and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then
LINE 129: he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, "All
LINE 130: right, ain't you, Aged P.?" To which the cheerful Aged replied, "All
LINE 131: right, John, my boy, all right!" As there seemed to be a tacit
LINE 132: understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was
LINE 133: therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in
LINE 134: complete ignorance of these proceedings.
LINE 135: "This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to
LINE 136: suspect)," I said to Wemmick when he came back, "is inseparable from
LINE 137: the person to whom you have adverted; is it?"
LINE 138: Wemmick looked very serious. "I couldn't undertake to say that, of my
LINE 139: own knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first. But
LINE 140: it either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being."
LINE 141: As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying
LINE 142: as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out
LINE 143: of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I
LINE 144: told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to
LINE 145: ask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he
LINE 146: deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his
LINE 147: breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his
LINE 148: notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me
LINE 149: once, to put my question.
LINE 150: "You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is
LINE 151: Compeyson?"
LINE 152: He answered with one other nod.
LINE 153: "Is he living?"
LINE 154: One other nod.
LINE 155: "Is he in London?"
LINE 156: He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave
LINE 157: me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.
LINE 158: "Now," said Wemmick, "questioning being over," which he emphasised and
LINE 159: repeated for my guidance, "I come to what I did, after hearing what I
LINE 160: heard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to
LINE 161: Clarriker's to find Mr. Herbert."
LINE 162: "And him you found?" said I, with great anxiety.
LINE 163: "And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any
LINE 164: details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom,
LINE 165: Jack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediate
LINE 166: neighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way
LINE 167: while you were out of the way."
LINE 168: "He would be greatly puzzled what to do?"
LINE 169: "He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my
LINE 170: opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too
LINE 171: far out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under
LINE 172: existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you
LINE 173: are once in it. Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things
LINE 174: slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air."
LINE 175: I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had
LINE 176: done?
LINE 177: "Mr. Herbert," said Wemmick, "after being all of a heap for half an
LINE 178: hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is
LINE 179: courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden
LINE 180: Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a
LINE 181: bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You
LINE 182: are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?"
LINE 183: "Not personally," said I.
LINE 184: The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion
LINE 185: who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to
LINE 186: present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very
LINE 187: moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the
LINE 188: state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time
LINE 189: before I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert's
LINE 190: prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful
LINE 191: philosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not
LINE 192: been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;
LINE 193: and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem,
LINE 194: and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged
LINE 195: messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I
LINE 196: did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.
LINE 197: "The house with the bow-window," said Wemmick, "being by the
LINE 198: river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and
LINE 199: being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished
LINE 200: upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that
LINE 201: as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very
LINE 202: well of it, for three reasons I'll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.
LINE 203: It's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual
LINE 204: heap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it
LINE 205: yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,
LINE 206: through Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be
LINE 207: prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a
LINE 208: foreign packet-boat, there he is—ready."
LINE 209: Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and
LINE 210: again, and begged him to proceed.
LINE 211: "Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,
LINE 212: and by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or
LINE 213: Richard,—whichever it may be,—you and I don't want to know,—quite
LINE 214: successfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was
LINE 215: summoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and
LINE 216: cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that
LINE 217: it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself
LINE 218: about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off
LINE 219: and quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;
LINE 220: and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last
LINE 221: night, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you
LINE 222: want confusion."
LINE 223: Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and
LINE 224: began to get his coat on.
LINE 225: "And now, Mr. Pip," said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, "I
LINE 226: have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from a
LINE 227: Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal
LINE 228: capacity,—I shall be glad to do it. Here's the address. There can be no
LINE 229: harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is
LINE 230: well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,—which is another
LINE 231: reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone
LINE 232: home, don't go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip";
LINE 233: his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; "and let
LINE 234: me finally impress one important point upon you." He laid his hands
LINE 235: upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: "Avail yourself of
LINE 236: this evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don't know what
LINE 237: may happen to him. Don't let anything happen to the portable property."
LINE 238: Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I
LINE 239: forbore to try.
LINE 240: "Time's up," said Wemmick, "and I must be off. If you had nothing more
LINE 241: pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that's what I should
LINE 242: advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a
LINE 243: perfectly quiet day with the Aged,—he'll be up presently,—and a little
LINE 244: bit of—you remember the pig?"
LINE 245: "Of course," said I.
LINE 246: "Well; and a little bit of _him_. That sausage you toasted was his, and
LINE 247: he was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old
LINE 248: acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!" in a cheery shout.
LINE 249: "All right, John; all right, my boy!" piped the old man from within.
LINE 250: I soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed
LINE 251: one another's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.
LINE 252: We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I
LINE 253: nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it
LINE 254: drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire
LINE 255: for toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from
LINE 256: his glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was
LINE 257: expected.
