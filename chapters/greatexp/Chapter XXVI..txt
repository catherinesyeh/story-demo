LINE 1: It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early
LINE 2: opportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his
LINE 3: cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with
LINE 4: his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he
LINE 5: called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
LINE 6: which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. "No ceremony," he stipulated,
LINE 7: "and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow." I asked him where we should
LINE 8: come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his
LINE 9: general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,
LINE 10: "Come here, and I'll take you home with me." I embrace this opportunity
LINE 11: of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or
LINE 12: a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,
LINE 13: which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop. It had an
LINE 14: unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would
LINE 15: wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,
LINE 16: whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his
LINE 17: room. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day, he
LINE 18: seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than
LINE 19: usual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only
LINE 20: washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And
LINE 21: even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,
LINE 22: he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before
LINE 23: he put his coat on.
LINE 24: There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
LINE 25: the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was
LINE 26: something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his
LINE 27: presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along
LINE 28: westward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of
LINE 29: the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he
LINE 30: never otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody
LINE 31: recognised him.
LINE 32: He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side
LINE 33: of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in
LINE 34: want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and
LINE 35: opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and
LINE 36: little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark
LINE 37: brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the
LINE 38: panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know
LINE 39: what kind of loops I thought they looked like.
LINE 40: Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his
LINE 41: dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the
LINE 42: whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was
LINE 43: comfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of
LINE 44: his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and
LINE 45: decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed
LINE 46: throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed
LINE 47: everything himself.
LINE 48: There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,
LINE 49: that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,
LINE 50: trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very
LINE 51: solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,
LINE 52: and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a
LINE 53: little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring
LINE 54: the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an
LINE 55: evening and fall to work.
LINE 56: As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had
LINE 57: walked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,
LINE 58: and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to
LINE 59: be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.
LINE 60: "Pip," said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
LINE 61: the window, "I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?"
LINE 62: "The spider?" said I.
LINE 63: "The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow."
LINE 64: "That's Bentley Drummle," I replied; "the one with the delicate face is
LINE 65: Startop."
LINE 66: Not making the least account of "the one with the delicate face," he
LINE 67: returned, "Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that
LINE 68: fellow."
LINE 69: He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his
LINE 70: replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to
LINE 71: screw discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came
LINE 72: between me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.
LINE 73: She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought her
LINE 74: younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely
LINE 75: pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot
LINE 76: say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be
LINE 77: parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious
LINE 78: expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see
LINE 79: Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked
LINE 80: to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had
LINE 81: seen rise out of the Witches' caldron.
LINE 82: She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
LINE 83: finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats
LINE 84: at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,
LINE 85: while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the
LINE 86: housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice
LINE 87: mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all
LINE 88: the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our
LINE 89: host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the
LINE 90: table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean
LINE 91: plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just
LINE 92: disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant
LINE 93: than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw
LINE 94: in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made
LINE 95: a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other
LINE 96: natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
LINE 97: behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.
LINE 98: Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own
LINE 99: striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that
LINE 100: whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my
LINE 101: guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put
LINE 102: before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and
LINE 103: wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I
LINE 104: fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and
LINE 105: a purpose of always holding her in suspense.
LINE 106: Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
LINE 107: than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of
LINE 108: our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing
LINE 109: my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to
LINE 110: boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my
LINE 111: lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the
LINE 112: development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
LINE 113: way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.
LINE 114: It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our
LINE 115: conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied
LINE 116: for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.
LINE 117: Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to
LINE 118: our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that
LINE 119: as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible
LINE 120: agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity
LINE 121: about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show
LINE 122: how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in
LINE 123: a ridiculous manner.
LINE 124: Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,
LINE 125: taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,
LINE 126: was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and
LINE 127: showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.
LINE 128: Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap,
LINE 129: as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do
LINE 130: this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.
LINE 131: "If you talk of strength," said Mr. Jaggers, "_I_'ll show you a wrist.
LINE 132: Molly, let them see your wrist."
LINE 133: Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other
LINE 134: hand behind her waist. "Master," she said, in a low voice, with her
LINE 135: eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. "Don't."
LINE 136: "_I_'ll show you a wrist," repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable
LINE 137: determination to show it. "Molly, let them see your wrist."
LINE 138: "Master," she again murmured. "Please!"
LINE 139: "Molly," said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking
LINE 140: at the opposite side of the room, "let them see _both_ your wrists.
LINE 141: Show them. Come!"
LINE 142: He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She
LINE 143: brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by
LINE 144: side. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred
LINE 145: across and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from
LINE 146: Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
LINE 147: in succession.
LINE 148: "There's power here," said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews
LINE 149: with his forefinger. "Very few men have the power of wrist that this
LINE 150: woman has. It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
LINE 151: hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw
LINE 152: stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these."
LINE 153: While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued
LINE 154: to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment
LINE 155: he ceased, she looked at him again. "That'll do, Molly," said Mr.
LINE 156: Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; "you have been admired, and can go."
LINE 157: She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,
LINE 158: putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and
LINE 159: passed round the wine.
LINE 160: "At half-past nine, gentlemen," said he, "we must break up. Pray make
LINE 161: the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I
LINE 162: drink to you."
LINE 163: If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,
LINE 164: it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose
LINE 165: depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,
LINE 166: until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.
LINE 167: Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed
LINE 168: to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.
LINE 169: In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,
LINE 170: and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some
LINE 171: boorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with
LINE 172: our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that
LINE 173: it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my
LINE 174: presence but a week or so before.
LINE 175: "Well," retorted Drummle; "he'll be paid."
LINE 176: "I don't mean to imply that he won't," said I, "but it might make you
LINE 177: hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think."
LINE 178: "_You_ should think!" retorted Drummle. "Oh Lord!"
LINE 179: "I dare say," I went on, meaning to be very severe, "that you wouldn't
LINE 180: lend money to any of us if we wanted it."
LINE 181: "You are right," said Drummle. "I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence.
LINE 182: I wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence."
LINE 183: "Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say."
LINE 184: "_You_ should say," repeated Drummle. "Oh Lord!"
LINE 185: This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myself
LINE 186: making no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding
LINE 187: Herbert's efforts to check me,—
LINE 188: "Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what
LINE 189: passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money."
LINE 190: "_I_ don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,"
LINE 191: growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might
LINE 192: both go to the devil and shake ourselves.
LINE 193: "I'll tell you, however," said I, "whether you want to know or not. We
LINE 194: said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed
LINE 195: to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it."
LINE 196: Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands
LINE 197: in his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that
LINE 198: it was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.
LINE 199: Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than
LINE 200: I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,
LINE 201: being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact
LINE 202: opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct
LINE 203: personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop
LINE 204: tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
LINE 205: us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,
LINE 206: Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his
LINE 207: pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and
LINE 208: would have flung it at his adversary's head, but for our entertainer's
LINE 209: dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
LINE 210: purpose.
LINE 211: "Gentlemen," said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and
LINE 212: hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, "I am exceedingly
LINE 213: sorry to announce that it's half past nine."
LINE 214: On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,
LINE 215: Startop was cheerily calling Drummle "old boy," as if nothing had
LINE 216: happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not
LINE 217: even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,
LINE 218: who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;
LINE 219: Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the
LINE 220: houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.
LINE 221: As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for
LINE 222: a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found
LINE 223: him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard
LINE 224: at it, washing his hands of us.
LINE 225: I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything
LINE 226: disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame
LINE 227: me much.
LINE 228: "Pooh!" said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the
LINE 229: water-drops; "it's nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though."
LINE 230: He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,
LINE 231: and towelling himself.
LINE 232: "I am glad you like him, sir," said I—"but I don't."
LINE 233: "No, no," my guardian assented; "don't have too much to do with him.
LINE 234: Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one
LINE 235: of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller—"
LINE 236: Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.
LINE 237: "But I am not a fortune-teller," he said, letting his head drop into a
LINE 238: festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. "You know what I
LINE 239: am, don't you? Good night, Pip."
LINE 240: "Good night, sir."
LINE 241: In about a month after that, the Spider's time with Mr. Pocket was up
LINE 242: for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he
LINE 243: went home to the family hole.
