LINE 1: It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first
LINE 2: flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe's.
LINE 3: But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow's coach, and had been
LINE 4: down to Mr. Pocket's and back, I was not by any means convinced on the
LINE 5: last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up
LINE 6: at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe's; I was not
LINE 7: expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss
LINE 8: Havisham's, and she was exacting and mightn't like it. All other
LINE 9: swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such
LINE 10: pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should
LINE 11: innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else's manufacture is
LINE 12: reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
LINE 13: of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of
LINE 14: compactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts the
LINE 15: notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,
LINE 16: when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!
LINE 17: Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much
LINE 18: disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was
LINE 19: tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots
LINE 20: in the archway of the Blue Boar's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to
LINE 21: imagine him casually produced in the tailor's shop, and confounding the
LINE 22: disrespectful senses of Trabb's boy. On the other hand, Trabb's boy
LINE 23: might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless
LINE 24: and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High
LINE 25: Street. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the
LINE 26: whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.
LINE 27: It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as
LINE 28: winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until
LINE 29: two or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys
LINE 30: was two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to
LINE 31: spare, attended by the Avenger,—if I may connect that expression with
LINE 32: one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.
LINE 33: At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards
LINE 34: by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
LINE 35: passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
LINE 36: their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised
LINE 37: when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were
LINE 38: two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old
LINE 39: reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word
LINE 40: "convict."
LINE 41: "You don't mind them, Handel?" said Herbert.
LINE 42: "O no!"
LINE 43: "I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?"
LINE 44: "I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't
LINE 45: particularly. But I don't mind them."
LINE 46: "See! There they are," said Herbert, "coming out of the Tap. What a
LINE 47: degraded and vile sight it is!"
LINE 48: They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler
LINE 49: with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.
LINE 50: The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their
LINE 51: legs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I
LINE 52: likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a
LINE 53: thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good
LINE 54: understanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at
LINE 55: the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts
LINE 56: were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he
LINE 57: the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and
LINE 58: appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the
LINE 59: world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller
LINE 60: suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those
LINE 61: shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his
LINE 62: half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on
LINE 63: the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had
LINE 64: brought me down with his invisible gun!
LINE 65: It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had
LINE 66: never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye
LINE 67: appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said
LINE 68: something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves
LINE 69: round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something
LINE 70: else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;
LINE 71: their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower
LINE 72: animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with
LINE 73: pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them
LINE 74: and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable
LINE 75: and degraded spectacle.
LINE 76: But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the
LINE 77: back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and
LINE 78: that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in
LINE 79: front behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had
LINE 80: taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,
LINE 81: and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such
LINE 82: villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and
LINE 83: infamous, and shameful, and I don't know what else. At this time the
LINE 84: coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing
LINE 85: to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringing
LINE 86: with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and
LINE 87: hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.
LINE 88: "Don't take it so much amiss, sir," pleaded the keeper to the angry
LINE 89: passenger; "I'll sit next you myself. I'll put 'em on the outside of
LINE 90: the row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're
LINE 91: there."
LINE 92: "And don't blame _me_," growled the convict I had recognised. "_I_
LINE 93: don't want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am
LINE 94: concerned any one's welcome to _my_ place."
LINE 95: "Or mine," said the other, gruffly. "_I_ wouldn't have incommoded none
LINE 96: of you, if I'd had _my_ way." Then they both laughed, and began
LINE 97: cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think I
LINE 98: should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so
LINE 99: despised.
LINE 100: At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,
LINE 101: and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So
LINE 102: he got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into
LINE 103: the place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as
LINE 104: they could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his
LINE 105: breath on the hair of my head.
LINE 106: "Good-bye, Handel!" Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a
LINE 107: blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.
LINE 108: It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's
LINE 109: breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The
LINE 110: sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
LINE 111: searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more
LINE 112: breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in
LINE 113: doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,
LINE 114: in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.
LINE 115: The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us
LINE 116: all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way
LINE 117: House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed
LINE 118: off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a
LINE 119: couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,
LINE 120: and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I
LINE 121: were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the
LINE 122: question up again.
LINE 123: But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I
LINE 124: could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
LINE 125: shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
LINE 126: blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
LINE 127: the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first
LINE 128: words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of
LINE 129: my own thought, "Two One Pound notes."
LINE 130: "How did he get 'em?" said the convict I had never seen.
LINE 131: "How should I know?" returned the other. "He had 'em stowed away
LINE 132: somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect."
LINE 133: "I wish," said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, "that I
LINE 134: had 'em here."
LINE 135: "Two one pound notes, or friends?"
LINE 136: "Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and
LINE 137: think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says—?"
LINE 138: "So he says," resumed the convict I had recognised,—"it was all said
LINE 139: and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the
LINE 140: Dock-yard,—'You're a-going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Would I find
LINE 141: out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two
LINE 142: one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did."
LINE 143: "More fool you," growled the other. "I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in
LINE 144: wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed
LINE 145: nothing of you?"
LINE 146: "Not a ha'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried
LINE 147: again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer."
LINE 148: "And was that—Honour!—the only time you worked out, in this part of the
LINE 149: country?"
LINE 150: "The only time."
LINE 151: "What might have been your opinion of the place?"
LINE 152: "A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,
LINE 153: mist, and mudbank."
LINE 154: They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually
LINE 155: growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.
LINE 156: After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and
LINE 157: been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling
LINE 158: certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not
LINE 159: only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and
LINE 160: so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could
LINE 161: have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our
LINE 162: being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
LINE 163: dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in
LINE 164: his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as
LINE 165: soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This
LINE 166: device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot
LINE 167: under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down
LINE 168: before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the
LINE 169: first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their
LINE 170: way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off
LINE 171: to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting
LINE 172: for them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff "Give way,
LINE 173: you!" like and order to dogs,—again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out
LINE 174: on the black water.
LINE 175: I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether
LINE 176: undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on
LINE 177: to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension
LINE 178: of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am
LINE 179: confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the
LINE 180: revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.
LINE 181: The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered
LINE 182: my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As
LINE 183: soon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory, he asked me
LINE 184: if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?
LINE 185: "No," said I, "certainly not."
LINE 186: The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from
LINE 187: the Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and
LINE 188: took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local
LINE 189: newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this
LINE 190: paragraph:—
LINE 191: Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference
LINE 192: to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of
LINE 193: this neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our
LINE 194: as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our
LINE 195: columns!) that the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was
LINE 196: a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn
LINE 197: and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business
LINE 198: premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is
LINE 199: not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as
LINE 200: the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our
LINE 201: town produced the founder of the latter's fortunes. Does the
LINE 202: thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local
LINE 203: Beauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the
LINE 204: BLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP.
LINE 205: I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the
LINE 206: days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met
LINE 207: somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have
LINE 208: told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my
LINE 209: fortunes.
