LINE 1: I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me
LINE 2: up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet
LINE 3: been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
LINE 4: house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon
LINE 5: the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into
LINE 6: which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was
LINE 7: vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.
LINE 8: "And where the deuce ha' _you_ been?" was Mrs. Joe's Christmas
LINE 9: salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
LINE 10: I said I had been down to hear the Carols. "Ah! well!" observed Mrs.
LINE 11: Joe. "You might ha' done worse." Not a doubt of that I thought.
LINE 12: "Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a
LINE 13: slave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear the
LINE 14: Carols," said Mrs. Joe. "I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and
LINE 15: that's the best of reasons for my never hearing any."
LINE 16: Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
LINE 17: retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a
LINE 18: conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her
LINE 19: eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and
LINE 20: exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.
LINE 21: This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for
LINE 22: weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to
LINE 23: their legs.
LINE 24: We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork
LINE 25: and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had
LINE 26: been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not
LINE 27: being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive
LINE 28: arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
LINE 29: breakfast; "for I ain't," said Mrs. Joe,—"I ain't a-going to have no
LINE 30: formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got
LINE 31: before me, I promise you!"
LINE 32: So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on
LINE 33: a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of
LINE 34: milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the
LINE 35: dresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and
LINE 36: tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the
LINE 37: old one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,
LINE 38: which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the
LINE 39: year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four
LINE 40: little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black
LINE 41: nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of
LINE 42: the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite
LINE 43: art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than
LINE 44: dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the
LINE 45: same by their religion.
LINE 46: My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that
LINE 47: is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a
LINE 48: well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he
LINE 49: was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
LINE 50: Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and
LINE 51: everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive
LINE 52: occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,
LINE 53: the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,
LINE 54: I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young
LINE 55: offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and
LINE 56: delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged
LINE 57: majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being
LINE 58: born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,
LINE 59: and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I
LINE 60: was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make
LINE 61: them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the
LINE 62: free use of my limbs.
LINE 63: Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle
LINE 64: for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to
LINE 65: what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.
LINE 66: Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be
LINE 67: equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
LINE 68: done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the
LINE 69: Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
LINE 70: terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived
LINE 71: the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman
LINE 72: said, "Ye are now to declare it!" would be the time for me to rise and
LINE 73: propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure
LINE 74: that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to
LINE 75: this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
LINE 76: Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble
LINE 77: the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle,
LINE 78: but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in
LINE 79: the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was
LINE 80: half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and
LINE 81: Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked
LINE 82: (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and
LINE 83: everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.
LINE 84: The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and
LINE 85: the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large
LINE 86: shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud
LINE 87: of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could
LINE 88: only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he
LINE 89: himself confessed that if the Church was "thrown open," meaning to
LINE 90: competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church
LINE 91: not being "thrown open," he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he
LINE 92: punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—always
LINE 93: giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as
LINE 94: much as to say, "You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your
LINE 95: opinion of this style!"
LINE 96: I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of
LINE 97: ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to
LINE 98: Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ was
LINE 99: not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.
LINE 100: "Mrs. Joe," said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged
LINE 101: slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair
LINE 102: standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been
LINE 103: all but choked, and had that moment come to, "I have brought you as the
LINE 104: compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry
LINE 105: wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine."
LINE 106: Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with
LINE 107: exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.
LINE 108: Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, "O, Un—cle
LINE 109: Pum-ble—chook! This _is_ kind!" Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he
LINE 110: now retorted, "It's no more than your merits. And now are you all
LINE 111: bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?" meaning me.
LINE 112: We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts
LINE 113: and oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like
LINE 114: Joe's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister
LINE 115: was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally
LINE 116: more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I
LINE 117: remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,
LINE 118: who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married
LINE 119: Mr. Hubble,—I don't know at what remote period,—when she was much
LINE 120: younger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,
LINE 121: stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs
LINE 122: extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some
LINE 123: miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.
LINE 124: Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't
LINE 125: robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in
LINE 126: at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and
LINE 127: the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to
LINE 128: speak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the
LINE 129: scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure
LINE 130: corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason
LINE 131: to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have
LINE 132: left me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think
LINE 133: the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,
LINE 134: every now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an
LINE 135: unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched
LINE 136: up by these moral goads.
LINE 137: It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with
LINE 138: theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a
LINE 139: religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and
LINE 140: ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
LINE 141: Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low
LINE 142: reproachful voice, "Do you hear that? Be grateful."
LINE 143: "Especially," said Mr. Pumblechook, "be grateful, boy, to them which
LINE 144: brought you up by hand."
LINE 145: Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful
LINE 146: presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, "Why is it that the
LINE 147: young are never grateful?" This moral mystery seemed too much for the
LINE 148: company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, "Naterally
LINE 149: wicious." Everybody then murmured "True!" and looked at me in a
LINE 150: particularly unpleasant and personal manner.
LINE 151: Joe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when
LINE 152: there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and
LINE 153: comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did
LINE 154: so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being
LINE 155: plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about
LINE 156: half a pint.
LINE 157: A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with
LINE 158: some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the
LINE 159: Church being "thrown open"—what kind of sermon _he_ would have given
LINE 160: them. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he
LINE 161: remarked that he considered the subject of the day's homily, ill
LINE 162: chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many
LINE 163: subjects "going about."
LINE 164: "True again," said Uncle Pumblechook. "You've hit it, sir! Plenty of
LINE 165: subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their
LINE 166: tails. That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject, if
LINE 167: he's ready with his salt-box." Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short
LINE 168: interval of reflection, "Look at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you
LINE 169: want a subject, look at Pork!"
LINE 170: "True, sir. Many a moral for the young," returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I
LINE 171: knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; "might be deduced
LINE 172: from that text."
LINE 173: ("You listen to this," said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)
LINE 174: Joe gave me some more gravy.
LINE 175: "Swine," pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his
LINE 176: fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—"swine
LINE 177: were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put
LINE 178: before us, as an example to the young." (I thought this pretty well in
LINE 179: him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)
LINE 180: "What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy."
LINE 181: "Or girl," suggested Mr. Hubble.
LINE 182: "Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble," assented Mr. Wopsle, rather
LINE 183: irritably, "but there is no girl present."
LINE 184: "Besides," said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, "think what
LINE 185: you've got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker—"
LINE 186: "He _was_, if ever a child was," said my sister, most emphatically.
LINE 187: Joe gave me some more gravy.
LINE 188: "Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker," said Mr. Pumblechook. "If
LINE 189: you had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—"
LINE 190: "Unless in that form," said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.
LINE 191: "But I don't mean in that form, sir," returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had
LINE 192: an objection to being interrupted; "I mean, enjoying himself with his
LINE 193: elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and
LINE 194: rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he
LINE 195: wouldn't. And what would have been your destination?" turning on me
LINE 196: again. "You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according
LINE 197: to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would
LINE 198: have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped
LINE 199: you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his
LINE 200: frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would
LINE 201: have shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.
LINE 202: Not a bit of it!"
LINE 203: Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.
LINE 204: "He was a world of trouble to you, ma'am," said Mrs. Hubble,
LINE 205: commiserating my sister.
LINE 206: "Trouble?" echoed my sister; "trouble?" and then entered on a fearful
LINE 207: catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts
LINE 208: of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled
LINE 209: from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I
LINE 210: had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I
LINE 211: had contumaciously refused to go there.
LINE 212: I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with
LINE 213: their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in
LINE 214: consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during
LINE 215: the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it
LINE 216: until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in
LINE 217: comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the
LINE 218: pause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which
LINE 219: pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with
LINE 220: indignation and abhorrence.
LINE 221: "Yet," said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the
LINE 222: theme from which they had strayed, "Pork—regarded as biled—is rich,
LINE 223: too; ain't it?"
LINE 224: "Have a little brandy, uncle," said my sister.
LINE 225: O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say
LINE 226: it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under
LINE 227: the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
LINE 228: My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,
LINE 229: and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man
LINE 230: trifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put
LINE 231: it down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were
LINE 232: briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.
LINE 233: I couldn't keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the
LINE 234: table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his
LINE 235: glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the
LINE 236: brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with
LINE 237: unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning
LINE 238: round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and
LINE 239: rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,
LINE 240: violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,
LINE 241: and apparently out of his mind.
LINE 242: I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn't know how I
LINE 243: had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my
LINE 244: dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and
LINE 245: surveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,
LINE 246: sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, "Tar!"
LINE 247: I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be
LINE 248: worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,
LINE 249: by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.
LINE 250: "Tar!" cried my sister, in amazement. "Why, how ever could Tar come
LINE 251: there?"
LINE 252: But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't
LINE 253: hear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all
LINE 254: away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had
LINE 255: begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in
LINE 256: getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and
LINE 257: mixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on
LINE 258: to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of
LINE 259: gratitude.
LINE 260: By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
LINE 261: pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.
LINE 262: The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the
LINE 263: genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over
LINE 264: the day, when my sister said to Joe, "Clean plates,—cold."
LINE 265: I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my
LINE 266: bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my
LINE 267: soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was
LINE 268: gone.
LINE 269: "You must taste," said my sister, addressing the guests with her best
LINE 270: grace—"you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious
LINE 271: present of Uncle Pumblechook's!"
LINE 272: Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!
LINE 273: "You must know," said my sister, rising, "it's a pie; a savory pork
LINE 274: pie."
LINE 275: The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of
LINE 276: having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously,
LINE 277: all things considered,—"Well, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavours;
LINE 278: let us have a cut at this same pie."
LINE 279: My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.
LINE 280: I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in
LINE 281: the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that "a bit
LINE 282: of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do
LINE 283: no harm," and I heard Joe say, "You shall have some, Pip." I have never
LINE 284: been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,
LINE 285: merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that
LINE 286: I could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of
LINE 287: the table, and ran for my life.
LINE 288: But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost
LINE 289: into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a
LINE 290: pair of handcuffs to me, saying, "Here you are, look sharp, come on!"
