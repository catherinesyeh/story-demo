LINE 1: "Dear boy and Pip's comrade. I am not a-going fur to tell you my life
LINE 2: like a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I'll
LINE 3: put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in
LINE 4: jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you've got it.
LINE 5: That's _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,
LINE 6: arter Pip stood my friend.
LINE 7: "I've been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged. I've been
LINE 8: locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've been carted here and
LINE 9: carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and
LINE 10: stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I've no more
LINE 11: notion where I was born than you have—if so much. I first become aware
LINE 12: of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had
LINE 13: run away from me—a man—a tinker—and he'd took the fire with him, and
LINE 14: left me wery cold.
LINE 15: "I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know it?
LINE 16: Much as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,
LINE 17: sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as
LINE 18: the birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.
LINE 19: "So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel
LINE 20: Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at
LINE 21: him, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,
LINE 22: took up, to that extent that I reg'larly grow'd up took up.
LINE 23: "This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as
LINE 24: much to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for
LINE 25: there warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the
LINE 26: name of being hardened. 'This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to
LINE 27: prison wisitors, picking out me. 'May be said to live in jails, this
LINE 28: boy.' Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured
LINE 29: my head, some on 'em,—they had better a measured my stomach,—and others
LINE 30: on 'em giv me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I
LINE 31: couldn't understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But
LINE 32: what the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,
LINE 33: mustn't I?—Howsomever, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear
LINE 34: boy and Pip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.
LINE 35: "Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,—though
LINE 36: that warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question
LINE 37: whether you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,—a bit
LINE 38: of a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a
LINE 39: haymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and
LINE 40: lead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a
LINE 41: Traveller's Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,
LINE 42: learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a
LINE 43: penny a time learnt me to write. I warn't locked up as often now as
LINE 44: formerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.
LINE 45: "At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted
LINE 46: wi' a man whose skull I'd crack wi' this poker, like the claw of a
LINE 47: lobster, if I'd got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and
LINE 48: that's the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,
LINE 49: according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last
LINE 50: night.
LINE 51: "He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he'd been to a public
LINE 52: boarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was
LINE 53: a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the
LINE 54: night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth
LINE 55: that I know'd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when
LINE 56: I went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a
LINE 57: sporting one) called him out, and said, 'I think this is a man that
LINE 58: might suit you,'—meaning I was.
LINE 59: "Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a
LINE 60: watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of
LINE 61: clothes.
LINE 62: "'To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me.
LINE 63: "'Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.' (I had come out of
LINE 64: Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have
LINE 65: been for something else; but it warn't.)
LINE 66: "'Luck changes,' says Compeyson; 'perhaps yours is going to change.'
LINE 67: "I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'
LINE 68: "'What can you do?' says Compeyson.
LINE 69: "'Eat and drink,' I says; 'if you'll find the materials.'
LINE 70: "Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five
LINE 71: shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.
LINE 72: "I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on
LINE 73: to be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson's business in which
LINE 74: we was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling,
LINE 75: handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts
LINE 76: of traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs
LINE 77: out of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was
LINE 78: Compeyson's business. He'd no more heart than a iron file, he was as
LINE 79: cold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.
LINE 80: "There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,—not as
LINE 81: being so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a
LINE 82: shadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a
LINE 83: rich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but
LINE 84: Compeyson betted and gamed, and he'd have run through the king's taxes.
LINE 85: So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,
LINE 86: and Compeyson's wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity
LINE 87: on him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and
LINE 88: nobody.
LINE 89: "I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I
LINE 90: was partick'ler—for where 'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?
LINE 91: So I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur
LINE 92: lived at the top of Compeyson's house (over nigh Brentford it was), and
LINE 93: Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in
LINE 94: case he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled
LINE 95: the account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a
LINE 96: tearing down into Compeyson's parlour late at night, in only a flannel
LINE 97: gown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson's wife,
LINE 98: 'Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of
LINE 99: her. She's all in white,' he says, 'wi' white flowers in her hair, and
LINE 100: she's awful mad, and she's got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she
LINE 101: says she'll put it on me at five in the morning.'
LINE 102: "Says Compeyson: 'Why, you fool, don't you know she's got a living
LINE 103: body? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,
LINE 104: or in at the window, and up the stairs?'
LINE 105: "'I don't know how she's there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with
LINE 106: the horrors, 'but she's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,
LINE 107: awful mad. And over where her heart's broke—_you_ broke it!—there's
LINE 108: drops of blood.'
LINE 109: "Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. 'Go up alonger this
LINE 110: drivelling sick man,' he says to his wife, 'and Magwitch, lend her a
LINE 111: hand, will you?' But he never come nigh himself.
LINE 112: "Compeyson's wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most
LINE 113: dreadful. 'Why look at her!' he cries out. 'She's a shaking the shroud
LINE 114: at me! Don't you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain't it awful to see her
LINE 115: so mad?' Next he cries, 'She'll put it on me, and then I'm done for!
LINE 116: Take it away from her, take it away!' And then he catched hold of us,
LINE 117: and kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed
LINE 118: I see her myself.
LINE 119: "Compeyson's wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the
LINE 120: horrors off, and by and by he quieted. 'O, she's gone! Has her keeper
LINE 121: been for her?' he says. 'Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. 'Did you tell him
LINE 122: to lock her and bar her in?' 'Yes.' 'And to take that ugly thing away
LINE 123: from her?' 'Yes, yes, all right.' 'You're a good creetur,' he says,
LINE 124: 'don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'
LINE 125: "He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and
LINE 126: then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, 'Here she is! She's
LINE 127: got the shroud again. She's unfolding it. She's coming out of the
LINE 128: corner. She's coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you—one of each
LINE 129: side—don't let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.
LINE 130: Don't let her throw it over my shoulders. Don't let her lift me up to
LINE 131: get it round me. She's lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he lifted
LINE 132: himself up hard, and was dead.
LINE 133: "Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me
LINE 134: was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own
LINE 135: book,—this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade
LINE 136: on.
LINE 137: "Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which 'ud
LINE 138: take a week—I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that
LINE 139: that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always
LINE 140: in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a
LINE 141: getting into danger. He was younger than me, but he'd got craft, and
LINE 142: he'd got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no
LINE 143: mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi'—Stop though! I ain't
LINE 144: brought _her_ in—"
LINE 145: He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in
LINE 146: the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and
LINE 147: spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them
LINE 148: on again.
LINE 149: "There ain't no need to go into it," he said, looking round once more.
LINE 150: "The time wi' Compeyson was a'most as hard a time as ever I had; that
LINE 151: said, all's said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for
LINE 152: misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?"
LINE 153: I answered, No.
LINE 154: "Well!" he said, "I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on
LINE 155: suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that
LINE 156: it lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both
LINE 157: committed for felony,—on a charge of putting stolen notes in
LINE 158: circulation,—and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,
LINE 159: 'Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. And I was so
LINE 160: miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on
LINE 161: my back, afore I could get Jaggers.
LINE 162: "When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman
LINE 163: Compeyson looked, wi' his curly hair and his black clothes and his
LINE 164: white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.
LINE 165: When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,
LINE 166: I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the
LINE 167: evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had
LINE 168: come for'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the
LINE 169: money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work
LINE 170: the thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see
LINE 171: the plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, 'My lord and
LINE 172: gentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your
LINE 173: eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be
LINE 174: spoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to
LINE 175: as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here
LINE 176: transactions, and only suspected; t'other, the elder, always seen in
LINE 177: 'em and always wi' his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is
LINE 178: but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is
LINE 179: much the worst one?' And such-like. And when it come to character,
LINE 180: warn't it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it his
LINE 181: schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't it him as
LINE 182: had been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to
LINE 183: his disadvantage? And warn't it me as had been tried afore, and as had
LINE 184: been know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when
LINE 185: it come to speech-making, warn't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi'
LINE 186: his face dropping every now and then into his white
LINE 187: pocket-handkercher,—ah! and wi' verses in his speech, too,—and warn't
LINE 188: it me as could only say, 'Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most
LINE 189: precious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't it Compeyson as was
LINE 190: recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and
LINE 191: giving up all the information he could agen me, and warn't it me as got
LINE 192: never a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, 'Once out of
LINE 193: this court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays
LINE 194: the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And
LINE 195: when we're sentenced, ain't it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,
LINE 196: and ain't it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so
LINE 197: well, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of
LINE 198: wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?"
LINE 199: He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked
LINE 200: it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching
LINE 201: out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, "I ain't a-going
LINE 202: to be low, dear boy!"
LINE 203: He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped
LINE 204: his face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.
LINE 205: [Illustration]
LINE 206: "I had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of his, and I swore
LINE 207: Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I
LINE 208: couldn't get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him
LINE 209: and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at
LINE 210: him, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn't a
LINE 211: strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I
LINE 212: escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,
LINE 213: envying them as was in 'em and all over, when I first see my boy!"
LINE 214: He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent
LINE 215: to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.
LINE 216: "By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them
LINE 217: marshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to
LINE 218: get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him
LINE 219: down. I smashed his face. 'And now,' says I 'as the worst thing I can
LINE 220: do, caring nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.' And I'd have swum
LINE 221: off, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got him
LINE 222: aboard without the soldiers.
LINE 223: "Of course he'd much the best of it to the last,—his character was so
LINE 224: good. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous
LINE 225: intentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought
LINE 226: to trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear boy and
LINE 227: Pip's comrade, being here."
LINE 228: He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his
LINE 229: tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his
LINE 230: button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.
LINE 231: "Is he dead?" I asked, after a silence.
LINE 232: "Is who dead, dear boy?"
LINE 233: "Compeyson."
LINE 234: "He hopes _I_ am, if he's alive, you may be sure," with a fierce look.
LINE 235: "I never heerd no more of him."
LINE 236: Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He
LINE 237: softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his
LINE 238: eyes on the fire, and I read in it:—
LINE 239: "Young Havisham's name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed
LINE 240: to be Miss Havisham's lover."
LINE 241: I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by;
LINE 242: but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he
LINE 243: stood smoking by the fire.
