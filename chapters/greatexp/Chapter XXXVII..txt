LINE 1: Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth
LINE 2: sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
LINE 3: to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union
LINE 4: Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of
LINE 5: defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most
LINE 6: pacific manner by the Aged.
LINE 7: "My son, sir," said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, "rather
LINE 8: had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word
LINE 9: that he would soon be home from his afternoon's walk. He is very
LINE 10: regular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my
LINE 11: son."
LINE 12: I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and
LINE 13: we went in and sat down by the fireside.
LINE 14: "You made acquaintance with my son, sir," said the old man, in his
LINE 15: chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, "at his office, I
LINE 16: expect?" I nodded. "Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand
LINE 17: at his business, sir?" I nodded hard. "Yes; so they tell me. His
LINE 18: business is the Law?" I nodded harder. "Which makes it more surprising
LINE 19: in my son," said the old man, "for he was not brought up to the Law,
LINE 20: but to the Wine-Coopering."
LINE 21: Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
LINE 22: reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into
LINE 23: the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
LINE 24: sprightly manner, "No, to be sure; you're right." And to this hour I
LINE 25: have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I
LINE 26: had made.
LINE 27: As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making
LINE 28: some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his
LINE 29: own calling in life had been "the Wine-Coopering." By dint of straining
LINE 30: that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on
LINE 31: the chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my
LINE 32: meaning understood.
LINE 33: "No," said the old gentleman; "the warehousing, the warehousing. First,
LINE 34: over yonder;" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he
LINE 35: intended to refer me to Liverpool; "and then in the City of London
LINE 36: here. However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—"
LINE 37: I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.
LINE 38: "—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he
LINE 39: went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and
LINE 40: little made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to
LINE 41: what you said, you know," pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,
LINE 42: "what I say is, No to be sure; you're right."
LINE 43: I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
LINE 44: me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this
LINE 45: imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall
LINE 46: on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
LINE 47: wooden flap with "JOHN" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried
LINE 48: with great triumph, "My son's come home!" and we both went out to the
LINE 49: drawbridge.
LINE 50: It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the
LINE 51: other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with
LINE 52: the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,
LINE 53: that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had
LINE 54: come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he
LINE 55: was accompanied.
LINE 56: Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in
LINE 57: the post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or
LINE 58: three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed
LINE 59: of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both
LINE 60: before and behind, made her figure very like a boy's kite; and I might
LINE 61: have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves
LINE 62: a little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of
LINE 63: fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in
LINE 64: discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our
LINE 65: going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for
LINE 66: announcing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a
LINE 67: moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently
LINE 68: another click came, and another little door tumbled open with "Miss
LINE 69: Skiffins" on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then
LINE 70: Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up
LINE 71: together. On Wemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances,
LINE 72: I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he
LINE 73: said, "Well, you know, they're both pleasant and useful to the Aged.
LINE 74: And by George, sir, it's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the
LINE 75: people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known
LINE 76: to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!"
LINE 77: "And Mr. Wemmick made them," added Miss Skiffins, "with his own hands
LINE 78: out of his own head."
LINE 79: While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green
LINE 80: gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
LINE 81: company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the
LINE 82: property, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he
LINE 83: did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I
LINE 84: seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.
LINE 85: Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I
LINE 86: had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in
LINE 87: behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how
LINE 88: we had fought. I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his character, and
LINE 89: at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;
LINE 90: those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had
LINE 91: derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I
LINE 92: confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might
LINE 93: have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham
LINE 94: in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the
LINE 95: possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the
LINE 96: certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any
LINE 97: mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told
LINE 98: Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a
LINE 99: great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some
LINE 100: rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience
LINE 101: and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my
LINE 102: resources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred a
LINE 103: year, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him on
LINE 104: to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to
LINE 105: understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's
LINE 106: knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world
LINE 107: with whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his
LINE 108: shoulder, and saying, "I can't help confiding in you, though I know it
LINE 109: must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever
LINE 110: brought me here."
LINE 111: Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of
LINE 112: start, "Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is
LINE 113: devilish good of you."
LINE 114: "Say you'll help me to be good then," said I.
LINE 115: "Ecod," replied Wemmick, shaking his head, "that's not my trade."
LINE 116: "Nor is this your trading-place," said I.
LINE 117: "You are right," he returned. "You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,
LINE 118: I'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be
LINE 119: done by degrees. Skiffins (that's her brother) is an accountant and
LINE 120: agent. I'll look him up and go to work for you."
LINE 121: "I thank you ten thousand times."
LINE 122: "On the contrary," said he, "I thank you, for though we are strictly in
LINE 123: our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there
LINE 124: _are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away."
LINE 125: After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned
LINE 126: into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The
LINE 127: responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and
LINE 128: that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me
LINE 129: in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were
LINE 130: going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a
LINE 131: hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as
LINE 132: it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss
LINE 133: Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises
LINE 134: became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to
LINE 135: participate in the entertainment.
LINE 136: The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right
LINE 137: moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth
LINE 138: as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed
LINE 139: the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of
LINE 140: John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some
LINE 141: spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I
LINE 142: got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss
LINE 143: Skiffins's arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and
LINE 144: I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the
LINE 145: profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very
LINE 146: new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by
LINE 147: Wemmick.
LINE 148: We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was
LINE 149: delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged
LINE 150: especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
LINE 151: tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in the
LINE 152: absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of
LINE 153: her family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling
LINE 154: lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on
LINE 155: her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, "Now,
LINE 156: Aged Parent, tip us the paper."
LINE 157: Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that
LINE 158: this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman
LINE 159: infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. "I won't offer an
LINE 160: apology," said Wemmick, "for he isn't capable of many pleasures—are
LINE 161: you, Aged P.?"
LINE 162: "All right, John, all right," returned the old man, seeing himself
LINE 163: spoken to.
LINE 164: "Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,"
LINE 165: said Wemmick, "and he'll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,
LINE 166: Aged One."
LINE 167: "All right, John, all right!" returned the cheerful old man, so busy
LINE 168: and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.
LINE 169: The Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's
LINE 170: great-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
LINE 171: through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was
LINE 172: always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into
LINE 173: them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was
LINE 174: equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,
LINE 175: quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all
LINE 176: expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he
LINE 177: resumed again.
LINE 178: As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a
LINE 179: shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.
LINE 180: Wemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually
LINE 181: stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins's waist. In course of time I saw
LINE 182: his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment
LINE 183: Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm
LINE 184: again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest
LINE 185: deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins's composure
LINE 186: while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever
LINE 187: seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction
LINE 188: of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it
LINE 189: mechanically.
LINE 190: By and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and
LINE 191: gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to
LINE 192: widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
LINE 193: enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side
LINE 194: of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness
LINE 195: of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid
LINE 196: it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am
LINE 197: justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading,
LINE 198: Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled
LINE 199: to it by Miss Skiffins.
LINE 200: At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time
LINE 201: for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black
LINE 202: bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical
LINE 203: dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these
LINE 204: appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who
LINE 205: was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and
LINE 206: Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer
LINE 207: to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had
LINE 208: best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and
LINE 209: having passed a pleasant evening.
LINE 210: Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,
LINE 211: stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter
LINE 212: appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would
LINE 213: be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to
LINE 214: Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by
LINE 215: appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication
LINE 216: with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that
LINE 217: we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long
LINE 218: established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted
LINE 219: capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a
LINE 220: partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which
LINE 221: Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds
LINE 222: down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at
LINE 223: certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my
LINE 224: property. Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick
LINE 225: pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.
LINE 226: The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the
LINE 227: least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the
LINE 228: radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a
LINE 229: mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the
LINE 230: young merchant's name), and of Clarriker's having shown an
LINE 231: extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the
LINE 232: opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his
LINE 233: face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate
LINE 234: friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of
LINE 235: triumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and
LINE 236: he having that day entered Clarriker's House, and he having talked to
LINE 237: me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really
LINE 238: cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations
LINE 239: had done some good to somebody.
LINE 240: A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my
LINE 241: view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all
LINE 242: the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not
LINE 243: much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.
