LINE 1: At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family
LINE 2: tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My
LINE 3: construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I
LINE 4: read "wife of the Above" as a complimentary reference to my father's
LINE 5: exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations
LINE 6: had been referred to as "Below," I have no doubt I should have formed
LINE 7: the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my
LINE 8: notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at
LINE 9: all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my
LINE 10: declaration that I was to "walk in the same all the days of my life,"
LINE 11: laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
LINE 12: house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down
LINE 13: by the wheelwright's or up by the mill.
LINE 14: When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I
LINE 15: could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called
LINE 16: "Pompeyed," or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only
LINE 17: odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extra
LINE 18: boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was
LINE 19: favoured with the employment. In order, however, that our superior
LINE 20: position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the
LINE 21: kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my
LINE 22: earnings were dropped. I have an impression that they were to be
LINE 23: contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt,
LINE 24: but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.
LINE 25: Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is
LINE 26: to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
LINE 27: infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in
LINE 28: the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the
LINE 29: improving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,
LINE 30: and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to
LINE 31: overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and
LINE 32: occasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr.
LINE 33: Wopsle "examined" the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those
LINE 34: occasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark
LINE 35: Antony's oration over the body of Caesar. This was always followed by
LINE 36: Collins's Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.
LINE 37: Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and
LINE 38: taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not
LINE 39: with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of
LINE 40: the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the
LINE 41: disadvantage of both gentlemen.
LINE 42: Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,
LINE 43: kept in the same room—a little general shop. She had no idea what stock
LINE 44: she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a
LINE 45: little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a
LINE 46: Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop
LINE 47: transactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I
LINE 48: confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what
LINE 49: relation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me,
LINE 50: too, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought,
LINE 51: in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,
LINE 52: her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending
LINE 53: and pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a
LINE 54: week-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.
LINE 55: Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.
LINE 56: Wopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
LINE 57: a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every
LINE 58: letter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who
LINE 59: seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
LINE 60: baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to
LINE 61: read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.
LINE 62: One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending
LINE 63: great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must
LINE 64: have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a
LINE 65: long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet
LINE 66: on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two
LINE 67: to print and smear this epistle:—
LINE 68: "MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE
LINE 69: U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN
LINE 70: BLEVE ME INF XN PIP."
LINE 71: There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by
LINE 72: letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered
LINE 73: this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe
LINE 74: received it as a miracle of erudition.
LINE 75: "I say, Pip, old chap!" cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, "what a
LINE 76: scholar you are! An't you?"
LINE 77: "I should like to be," said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;
LINE 78: with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.
LINE 79: "Why, here's a J," said Joe, "and a O equal to anythink! Here's a J and
LINE 80: a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe."
LINE 81: [Illustration]
LINE 82: I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
LINE 83: monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I
LINE 84: accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit
LINE 85: his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to
LINE 86: embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I
LINE 87: should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, "Ah! But read the
LINE 88: rest, Jo."
LINE 89: "The rest, eh, Pip?" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching
LINE 90: eye, "One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three
LINE 91: J-O, Joes in it, Pip!"
LINE 92: I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the
LINE 93: whole letter.
LINE 94: "Astonishing!" said Joe, when I had finished. "You ARE a scholar."
LINE 95: "How do you spell Gargery, Joe?" I asked him, with a modest patronage.
LINE 96: "I don't spell it at all," said Joe.
LINE 97: "But supposing you did?"
LINE 98: "It _can't_ be supposed," said Joe. "Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading,
LINE 99: too."
LINE 100: "Are you, Joe?"
LINE 101: "On-common. Give me," said Joe, "a good book, or a good newspaper, and
LINE 102: sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!" he
LINE 103: continued, after rubbing his knees a little, "when you _do_ come to a J
LINE 104: and a O, and says you, 'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting
LINE 105: reading is!"
LINE 106: I derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its
LINE 107: infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—
LINE 108: "Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"
LINE 109: "No, Pip."
LINE 110: "Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"
LINE 111: "Well, Pip," said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his
LINE 112: usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire
LINE 113: between the lower bars; "I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given
LINE 114: to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my
LINE 115: mother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the only hammering he did,
LINE 116: indeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to
LINE 117: be equalled by the wigor with which he didn't hammer at his
LINE 118: anwil.—You're a listening and understanding, Pip?"
LINE 119: "Yes, Joe."
LINE 120: "Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several
LINE 121: times; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd say, "Joe,"
LINE 122: she'd say, "now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child," and
LINE 123: she'd put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that
LINE 124: he couldn't abear to be without us. So, he'd come with a most
LINE 125: tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where
LINE 126: we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us
LINE 127: and to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.
LINE 128: Which, you see, Pip," said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the
LINE 129: fire, and looking at me, "were a drawback on my learning."
LINE 130: "Certainly, poor Joe!"
LINE 131: "Though mind you, Pip," said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the
LINE 132: poker on the top bar, "rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining
LINE 133: equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his
LINE 134: hart, don't you see?"
LINE 135: I didn't see; but I didn't say so.
LINE 136: "Well!" Joe pursued, "somebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or the
LINE 137: pot won't bile, don't you know?"
LINE 138: I saw that, and said so.
LINE 139: "Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going to work; so
LINE 140: I went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would
LINE 141: have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure _you_, Pip. In
LINE 142: time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a
LINE 143: purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his
LINE 144: tombstone that, Whatsume'er the failings on his part, Remember reader
LINE 145: he were that good in his heart."
LINE 146: Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful
LINE 147: perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.
LINE 148: "I made it," said Joe, "my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like
LINE 149: striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so
LINE 150: much surprised in all my life,—couldn't credit my own ed,—to tell you
LINE 151: the truth, hardly believed it _were_ my own ed. As I was saying, Pip,
LINE 152: it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs
LINE 153: money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not
LINE 154: to mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for
LINE 155: my mother. She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren't long of
LINE 156: following, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last."
LINE 157: Joe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them,
LINE 158: and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner,
LINE 159: with the round knob on the top of the poker.
LINE 160: "It were but lonesome then," said Joe, "living here alone, and I got
LINE 161: acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,"—Joe looked firmly at me as if
LINE 162: he knew I was not going to agree with him;—"your sister is a fine
LINE 163: figure of a woman."
LINE 164: I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.
LINE 165: "Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that
LINE 166: subject may be, Pip, your sister is," Joe tapped the top bar with the
LINE 167: poker after every word following, "a-fine-figure—of—a—woman!"
LINE 168: I could think of nothing better to say than "I am glad you think so,
LINE 169: Joe."
LINE 170: "So am I," returned Joe, catching me up. "_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.
LINE 171: A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does
LINE 172: it signify to Me?"
LINE 173: I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him, to whom did it
LINE 174: signify?
LINE 175: "Certainly!" assented Joe. "That's it. You're right, old chap! When I
LINE 176: got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing
LINE 177: you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,
LINE 178: along with all the folks. As to you," Joe pursued with a countenance
LINE 179: expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, "if you could have
LINE 180: been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you'd have
LINE 181: formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!"
LINE 182: Not exactly relishing this, I said, "Never mind me, Joe."
LINE 183: "But I did mind you, Pip," he returned with tender simplicity. "When I
LINE 184: offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at
LINE 185: such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to
LINE 186: her, 'And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little
LINE 187: child,' I said to your sister, 'there's room for _him_ at the forge!'"
LINE 188: I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:
LINE 189: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, "Ever the best of friends;
LINE 190: an't us, Pip? Don't cry, old chap!"
LINE 191: When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—
LINE 192: "Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights;
LINE 193: here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I
LINE 194: tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't
LINE 195: see too much of what we're up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the
LINE 196: sly. And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip."
LINE 197: He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could
LINE 198: have proceeded in his demonstration.
LINE 199: "Your sister is given to government."
LINE 200: "Given to government, Joe?" I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea
LINE 201: (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a
LINE 202: favour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.
LINE 203: "Given to government," said Joe. "Which I meantersay the government of
LINE 204: you and myself."
LINE 205: "Oh!"
LINE 206: "And she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises," Joe
LINE 207: continued, "and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
LINE 208: scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't you
LINE 209: see?"
LINE 210: I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as "Why—"
LINE 211: when Joe stopped me.
LINE 212: "Stay a bit. I know what you're a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I
LINE 213: don't deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I
LINE 214: don't deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down
LINE 215: upon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,
LINE 216: Pip," Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, "candour
LINE 217: compels fur to admit that she is a Buster."
LINE 218: Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital
LINE 219: Bs.
LINE 220: "Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,
LINE 221: Pip?"
LINE 222: "Yes, Joe."
LINE 223: "Well," said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might
LINE 224: feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that
LINE 225: placid occupation; "your sister's a master-mind. A master-mind."
LINE 226: "What's that?" I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But
LINE 227: Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely
LINE 228: stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,
LINE 229: "Her."
LINE 230: "And I ain't a master-mind," Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,
LINE 231: and got back to his whisker. "And last of all, Pip,—and this I want to
LINE 232: say very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor mother, of
LINE 233: a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never
LINE 234: getting no peace in her mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going
LINE 235: wrong in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur
LINE 236: rather of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little
LINE 237: ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I
LINE 238: wish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it
LINE 239: all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and
LINE 240: I hope you'll overlook shortcomings."
LINE 241: Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from
LINE 242: that night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,
LINE 243: afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about
LINE 244: him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up
LINE 245: to Joe in my heart.
LINE 246: "However," said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; "here's the
LINE 247: Dutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em,
LINE 248: and she's not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't
LINE 249: have set a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down."
LINE 250: Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,
LINE 251: to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a
LINE 252: woman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no
LINE 253: confidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe
LINE 254: was out on one of these expeditions.
LINE 255: Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to
LINE 256: listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew
LINE 257: keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of
LINE 258: lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,
LINE 259: and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to
LINE 260: them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the
LINE 261: glittering multitude.
LINE 262: "Here comes the mare," said Joe, "ringing like a peal of bells!"
LINE 263: The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as
LINE 264: she came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,
LINE 265: ready for Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might
LINE 266: see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that
LINE 267: nothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these
LINE 268: preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon
LINE 269: landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with
LINE 270: a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air
LINE 271: in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.
LINE 272: "Now," said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and
LINE 273: throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,
LINE 274: "if this boy ain't grateful this night, he never will be!"
LINE 275: I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly
LINE 276: uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.
LINE 277: "It's only to be hoped," said my sister, "that he won't be Pompeyed.
LINE 278: But I have my fears."
LINE 279: "She ain't in that line, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "She knows
LINE 280: better."
LINE 281: She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,
LINE 282: "She?" Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips and
LINE 283: eyebrows, "She?" My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of
LINE 284: his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such
LINE 285: occasions, and looked at her.
LINE 286: "Well?" said my sister, in her snappish way. "What are you staring at?
LINE 287: Is the house afire?"
LINE 288: "—Which some individual," Joe politely hinted, "mentioned—she."
LINE 289: "And she is a she, I suppose?" said my sister. "Unless you call Miss
LINE 290: Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that."
LINE 291: "Miss Havisham, up town?" said Joe.
LINE 292: "Is there any Miss Havisham down town?" returned my sister.
LINE 293: "She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he's going. And
LINE 294: he had better play there," said my sister, shaking her head at me as an
LINE 295: encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, "or I'll work him."
LINE 296: I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round had
LINE 297: heard of Miss Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lady who
LINE 298: lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who
LINE 299: led a life of seclusion.
LINE 300: "Well to be sure!" said Joe, astounded. "I wonder how she come to know
LINE 301: Pip!"
LINE 302: "Noodle!" cried my sister. "Who said she knew him?"
LINE 303: "—Which some individual," Joe again politely hinted, "mentioned that
LINE 304: she wanted him to go and play there."
LINE 305: "And couldn't she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and
LINE 306: play there? Isn't it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be
LINE 307: a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes—we won't say quarterly or
LINE 308: half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—but
LINE 309: sometimes—go there to pay his rent? And couldn't she then ask Uncle
LINE 310: Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn't
LINE 311: Uncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for
LINE 312: us—though you may not think it, Joseph," in a tone of the deepest
LINE 313: reproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, "then mention this
LINE 314: boy, standing Prancing here"—which I solemnly declare I was not
LINE 315: doing—"that I have for ever been a willing slave to?"
LINE 316: "Good again!" cried Uncle Pumblechook. "Well put! Prettily pointed!
LINE 317: Good indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case."
LINE 318: "No, Joseph," said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe
LINE 319: apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,
LINE 320: "you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case. You may
LINE 321: consider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph. For you do not know
LINE 322: that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,
LINE 323: this boy's fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham's, has
LINE 324: offered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to
LINE 325: keep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss
LINE 326: Havisham's to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!" cried my sister,
LINE 327: casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, "here I stand talking to
LINE 328: mere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching
LINE 329: cold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair
LINE 330: of his head to the sole of his foot!"
LINE 331: With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face
LINE 332: was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps
LINE 333: of water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and
LINE 334: thumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside
LINE 335: myself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better
LINE 336: acquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a
LINE 337: wedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)
LINE 338: When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the
LINE 339: stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was
LINE 340: trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered
LINE 341: over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the
LINE 342: Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been
LINE 343: dying to make all along: "Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but
LINE 344: especially unto them which brought you up by hand!"
LINE 345: "Good-bye, Joe!"
LINE 346: "God bless you, Pip, old chap!"
LINE 347: I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what
LINE 348: with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But
LINE 349: they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the
LINE 350: questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham's, and what
LINE 351: on earth I was expected to play at.
