LINE 1: On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country
LINE 2: elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The
LINE 3: whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble
LINE 4: boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer
LINE 5: with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in
LINE 6: life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of
LINE 7: white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My
LINE 8: gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could
LINE 9: have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.
LINE 10: Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action
LINE 11: proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been
LINE 12: troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it
LINE 13: with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom
LINE 14: also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had
LINE 15: the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of
LINE 16: anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were
LINE 17: suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led
LINE 18: to the Shade's being advised by the gallery to "turn over!"—a
LINE 19: recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted
LINE 20: of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of
LINE 21: having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it
LINE 22: perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its
LINE 23: terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom
LINE 24: lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public
LINE 25: to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem
LINE 26: by a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her
LINE 27: waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so
LINE 28: that she was openly mentioned as "the kettle-drum." The noble boy in
LINE 29: the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were
LINE 30: in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a
LINE 31: clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court
LINE 32: fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice
LINE 33: discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a
LINE 34: want of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy
LINE 35: orders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general
LINE 36: indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such
LINE 37: slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off
LINE 38: her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who
LINE 39: had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the
LINE 40: front row of the gallery, growled, "Now the baby's put to bed let's
LINE 41: have supper!" Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.
LINE 42: Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
LINE 43: playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or
LINE 44: state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on
LINE 45: the question whether 'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared
LINE 46: yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said "Toss up for
LINE 47: it;" and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such
LINE 48: fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged
LINE 49: with loud cries of "Hear, hear!" When he appeared with his stocking
LINE 50: disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very
LINE 51: neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat
LINE 52: iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness
LINE 53: of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had
LINE 54: given him. On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute
LINE 55: that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the
LINE 56: door,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he
LINE 57: recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,
LINE 58: "And don't _you_ do it, neither; you're a deal worse than _him_!" And I
LINE 59: grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of
LINE 60: these occasions.
LINE 61: But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the
LINE 62: appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical
LINE 63: wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in
LINE 64: a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,
LINE 65: the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, "Look out! Here's the
LINE 66: undertaker a coming, to see how you're a getting on with your work!" I
LINE 67: believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle
LINE 68: could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,
LINE 69: without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;
LINE 70: but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without
LINE 71: the comment, "Wai-ter!" The arrival of the body for interment (in an
LINE 72: empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a
LINE 73: general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the
LINE 74: bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended
LINE 75: Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the
LINE 76: orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the
LINE 77: king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles
LINE 78: upward.
LINE 79: We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;
LINE 80: but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,
LINE 81: feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I
LINE 82: laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;
LINE 83: and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
LINE 84: fine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution,—not for old associations' sake, I am
LINE 85: afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and
LINE 86: downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
LINE 87: circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.
LINE 88: When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I
LINE 89: said to Herbert, "Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him."
LINE 90: We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough
LINE 91: either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy
LINE 92: smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we
LINE 93: came up with him,—
LINE 94: "Mr. Pip and friend?"
LINE 95: Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.
LINE 96: "Mr. Waldengarver," said the man, "would be glad to have the honour."
LINE 97: "Waldengarver?" I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, "Probably
LINE 98: Wopsle."
LINE 99: "Oh!" said I. "Yes. Shall we follow you?"
LINE 100: "A few steps, please." When we were in a side alley, he turned and
LINE 101: asked, "How did you think he looked?—I dressed him."
LINE 102: I don't know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the
LINE 103: addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue
LINE 104: ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some
LINE 105: extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.
LINE 106: "When he come to the grave," said our conductor, "he showed his cloak
LINE 107: beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see
LINE 108: the ghost in the queen's apartment, he might have made more of his
LINE 109: stockings."
LINE 110: I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,
LINE 111: into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle
LINE 112: was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just
LINE 113: room for us to look at him over one another's shoulders, by keeping the
LINE 114: packing-case door, or lid, wide open.
LINE 115: "Gentlemen," said Mr. Wopsle, "I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,
LINE 116: you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in
LINE 117: former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
LINE 118: acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent."
LINE 119: Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to
LINE 120: get himself out of his princely sables.
LINE 121: "Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver," said the owner of that
LINE 122: property, "or you'll bust 'em. Bust 'em, and you'll bust
LINE 123: five-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a
LINE 124: finer pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me."
LINE 125: With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,
LINE 126: on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over
LINE 127: backward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.
LINE 128: I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,
LINE 129: Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,—
LINE 130: "Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?"
LINE 131: Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), "Capitally." So
LINE 132: I said "Capitally."
LINE 133: "How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?" said Mr.
LINE 134: Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.
LINE 135: Herbert said from behind (again poking me), "Massive and concrete." So
LINE 136: I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon
LINE 137: it, "Massive and concrete."
LINE 138: "I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver,
LINE 139: with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall
LINE 140: at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.
LINE 141: "But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver," said the man who was
LINE 142: on his knees, "in which you're out in your reading. Now mind! I don't
LINE 143: care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of
LINE 144: Hamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,
LINE 145: made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to
LINE 146: put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal
LINE 147: (which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and
LINE 148: whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out "I don't
LINE 149: see no wafers!" And at night his reading was lovely."
LINE 150: Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say "a faithful
LINE 151: Dependent—I overlook his folly;" and then said aloud, "My view is a
LINE 152: little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,
LINE 153: they will improve."
LINE 154: Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.
LINE 155: "Did you observe, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver, "that there was a
LINE 156: man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,—I
LINE 157: mean, the representation?"
LINE 158: We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I
LINE 159: added, "He was drunk, no doubt."
LINE 160: "O dear no, sir," said Mr. Wopsle, "not drunk. His employer would see
LINE 161: to that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk."
LINE 162: "You know his employer?" said I.
LINE 163: Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both
LINE 164: ceremonies very slowly. "You must have observed, gentlemen," said he,
LINE 165: "an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance
LINE 166: expressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not say
LINE 167: sustained—the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King
LINE 168: of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!"
LINE 169: Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for
LINE 170: Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,
LINE 171: that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put
LINE 172: on,—which jostled us out at the doorway,—to ask Herbert what he thought
LINE 173: of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind
LINE 174: to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard's with us,
LINE 175: wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until
LINE 176: two o'clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his
LINE 177: plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general
LINE 178: recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end
LINE 179: with crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft
LINE 180: and without a chance or hope.
LINE 181: Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,
LINE 182: and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that
LINE 183: I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert's Clara, or play Hamlet to
LINE 184: Miss Havisham's Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing
LINE 185: twenty words of it.
