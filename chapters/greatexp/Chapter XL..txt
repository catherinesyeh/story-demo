LINE 1: It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so
LINE 2: far as I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought
LINE 3: pressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused
LINE 4: concourse at a distance.
LINE 5: The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
LINE 6: self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would
LINE 7: inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service
LINE 8: now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by
LINE 9: an animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room
LINE 10: secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They
LINE 11: both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically
LINE 12: looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;
LINE 13: indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get
LINE 14: up a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning
LINE 15: that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.
LINE 16: This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness
LINE 17: for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,
LINE 18: I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there
LINE 19: to come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black
LINE 20: staircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching
LINE 21: in a corner.
LINE 22: As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but
LINE 23: eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman
LINE 24: to come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind
LINE 25: being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the
LINE 26: lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we
LINE 27: examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one
LINE 28: there. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have
LINE 29: slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman's, and
LINE 30: leaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including
LINE 31: the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and
LINE 32: assuredly no other man was in those chambers.
LINE 33: It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on
LINE 34: that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the
LINE 35: chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at
LINE 36: the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
LINE 37: perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the
LINE 38: night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in
LINE 39: the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man
LINE 40: who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
LINE 41: the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the
LINE 42: night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
LINE 43: upstairs.
LINE 44: "The night being so bad, sir," said the watchman, as he gave me back my
LINE 45: glass, "uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three
LINE 46: gentlemen that I have named, I don't call to mind another since about
LINE 47: eleven o'clock, when a stranger asked for you."
LINE 48: "My uncle," I muttered. "Yes."
LINE 49: "You saw him, sir?"
LINE 50: "Yes. Oh yes."
LINE 51: "Likewise the person with him?"
LINE 52: "Person with him!" I repeated.
LINE 53: "I judged the person to be with him," returned the watchman. "The
LINE 54: person stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person
LINE 55: took this way when he took this way."
LINE 56: "What sort of person?"
LINE 57: The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working
LINE 58: person; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind of
LINE 59: clothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the
LINE 60: matter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching
LINE 61: weight to it.
LINE 62: When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without
LINE 63: prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two
LINE 64: circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent
LINE 65: solution apart,—as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who
LINE 66: had not gone near this watchman's gate, might have strayed to my
LINE 67: staircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might have
LINE 68: brought some one with him to show him the way,—still, joined, they had
LINE 69: an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
LINE 70: few hours had made me.
LINE 71: I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of
LINE 72: the morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been
LINE 73: dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an
LINE 74: hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up
LINE 75: uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,
LINE 76: making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into
LINE 77: a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.
LINE 78: All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor
LINE 79: could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly
LINE 80: dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As
LINE 81: to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an
LINE 82: elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
LINE 83: morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I
LINE 84: sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to
LINE 85: appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long
LINE 86: I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or
LINE 87: even who I was that made it.
LINE 88: At last, the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a head
LINE 89: not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,—and testified surprise
LINE 90: at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come
LINE 91: in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations
LINE 92: were to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they
LINE 93: knocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream
LINE 94: or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting
LINE 95: for—Him—to come to breakfast.
LINE 96: By and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to
LINE 97: bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.
LINE 98: "I do not even know," said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the
LINE 99: table, "by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my
LINE 100: uncle."
LINE 101: "That's it, dear boy! Call me uncle."
LINE 102: "You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?"
LINE 103: "Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis."
LINE 104: "Do you mean to keep that name?"
LINE 105: "Why, yes, dear boy, it's as good as another,—unless you'd like
LINE 106: another."
LINE 107: "What is your real name?" I asked him in a whisper.
LINE 108: "Magwitch," he answered, in the same tone; "chrisen'd Abel."
LINE 109: "What were you brought up to be?"
LINE 110: "A warmint, dear boy."
LINE 111: He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some
LINE 112: profession.
LINE 113: "When you came into the Temple last night—" said I, pausing to wonder
LINE 114: whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long
LINE 115: ago.
LINE 116: "Yes, dear boy?"
LINE 117: "When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had
LINE 118: you any one with you?"
LINE 119: "With me? No, dear boy."
LINE 120: "But there was some one there?"
LINE 121: "I didn't take particular notice," he said, dubiously, "not knowing the
LINE 122: ways of the place. But I think there _was_ a person, too, come in
LINE 123: alonger me."
LINE 124: "Are you known in London?"
LINE 125: "I hope not!" said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
LINE 126: made me turn hot and sick.
LINE 127: "Were you known in London, once?"
LINE 128: "Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly."
LINE 129: "Were you—tried—in London?"
LINE 130: "Which time?" said he, with a sharp look.
LINE 131: "The last time."
LINE 132: He nodded. "First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me."
LINE 133: It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a
LINE 134: knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, "And what I done is
LINE 135: worked out and paid for!" fell to at his breakfast.
LINE 136: He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his
LINE 137: actions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed
LINE 138: him since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in
LINE 139: his mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to
LINE 140: bear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun
LINE 141: with any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat
LINE 142: much as I did,—repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and
LINE 143: gloomily looking at the cloth.
LINE 144: "I'm a heavy grubber, dear boy," he said, as a polite kind of apology
LINE 145: when he made an end of his meal, "but I always was. If it had been in
LINE 146: my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter
LINE 147: trouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as
LINE 148: shepherd t'other side the world, it's my belief I should ha' turned
LINE 149: into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke."
LINE 150: As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the
LINE 151: breast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a
LINE 152: handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having
LINE 153: filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his
LINE 154: pocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the
LINE 155: tongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the
LINE 156: hearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favourite
LINE 157: action of holding out both his hands for mine.
LINE 158: "And this," said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed
LINE 159: at his pipe,—"and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine
LINE 160: One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip'late, is, to
LINE 161: stand by and look at you, dear boy!"
LINE 162: I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning
LINE 163: slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was
LINE 164: chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his
LINE 165: hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its
LINE 166: iron grey hair at the sides.
LINE 167: "I mustn't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;
LINE 168: there mustn't be no mud on _his_ boots. My gentleman must have horses,
LINE 169: Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to
LINE 170: ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood
LINE 171: 'uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.
LINE 172: We'll show 'em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won't us?"
LINE 173: He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with
LINE 174: papers, and tossed it on the table.
LINE 175: "There's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It's
LINE 176: yourn. All I've got ain't mine; it's yourn. Don't you be afeerd on it.
LINE 177: There's more where that come from. I've come to the old country fur to
LINE 178: see my gentleman spend his money _like_ a gentleman. That'll be _my_
LINE 179: pleasure. _My_ pleasure 'ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you
LINE 180: all!" he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once
LINE 181: with a loud snap, "blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to
LINE 182: the colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than
LINE 183: the whole kit on you put together!"
LINE 184: "Stop!" said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, "I want to
LINE 185: speak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you
LINE 186: are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what
LINE 187: projects you have."
LINE 188: "Look'ee here, Pip," said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly
LINE 189: altered and subdued manner; "first of all, look'ee here. I forgot
LINE 190: myself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that's what it was; low.
LINE 191: Look'ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain't a-going to be low."
LINE 192: "First," I resumed, half groaning, "what precautions can be taken
LINE 193: against your being recognised and seized?"
LINE 194: "No, dear boy," he said, in the same tone as before, "that don't go
LINE 195: first. Lowness goes first. I ain't took so many year to make a
LINE 196: gentleman, not without knowing what's due to him. Look'ee here, Pip. I
LINE 197: was low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy."
LINE 198: Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I
LINE 199: replied, "I _have_ looked over it. In Heaven's name, don't harp upon
LINE 200: it!"
LINE 201: "Yes, but look'ee here," he persisted. "Dear boy, I ain't come so fur,
LINE 202: not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying—"
LINE 203: "How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?"
LINE 204: "Well, dear boy, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed
LINE 205: agen, the danger ain't so much to signify. There's Jaggers, and there's
LINE 206: Wemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?"
LINE 207: "Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?" said
LINE 208: I.
LINE 209: "Well," he returned, "there ain't many. Nor yet I don't intend to
LINE 210: advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from
LINE 211: Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it? Still,
LINE 212: look'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I
LINE 213: should ha' come to see you, mind you, just the same."
LINE 214: "And how long do you remain?"
LINE 215: "How long?" said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping
LINE 216: his jaw as he stared at me. "I'm not a-going back. I've come for good."
LINE 217: "Where are you to live?" said I. "What is to be done with you? Where
LINE 218: will you be safe?"
LINE 219: "Dear boy," he returned, "there's disguising wigs can be bought for
LINE 220: money, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black
LINE 221: clothes,—shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what
LINE 222: others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of
LINE 223: living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it."
LINE 224: "You take it smoothly now," said I, "but you were very serious last
LINE 225: night, when you swore it was Death."
LINE 226: "And so I swear it is Death," said he, putting his pipe back in his
LINE 227: mouth, "and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,
LINE 228: and it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What
LINE 229: then, when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now 'ud be as bad as
LINE 230: to stand ground—worse. Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by
LINE 231: you, years and years. As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has
LINE 232: dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I'm not
LINE 233: afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there's Death hid inside of it,
LINE 234: there is, and let him come out, and I'll face him, and then I'll
LINE 235: believe in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my
LINE 236: gentleman agen."
LINE 237: Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
LINE 238: admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.
LINE 239: It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet
LINE 240: lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert
LINE 241: returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be
LINE 242: confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I
LINE 243: could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with
LINE 244: him out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so
LINE 245: plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved
LINE 246: his consent to Herbert's participation until he should have seen him
LINE 247: and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. "And even then,
LINE 248: dear boy," said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out
LINE 249: of his pocket, "we'll have him on his oath."
LINE 250: To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
LINE 251: the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to
LINE 252: state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never
LINE 253: knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of
LINE 254: having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his
LINE 255: knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that
LINE 256: wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or
LINE 257: charm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he
LINE 258: had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had
LINE 259: described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in
LINE 260: his solitude.
LINE 261: As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he
LINE 262: looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next
LINE 263: discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an
LINE 264: extraordinary belief in the virtues of "shorts" as a disguise, and had
LINE 265: in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him
LINE 266: something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable
LINE 267: difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a
LINE 268: prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,
LINE 269: and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the
LINE 270: laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until
LINE 271: his change of dress was made.
LINE 272: It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my
LINE 273: dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not
LINE 274: get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to
LINE 275: remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account
LINE 276: to open the door.
LINE 277: There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex
LINE 278: Street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within
LINE 279: hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so
LINE 280: fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I
LINE 281: then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to
LINE 282: the change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my
LINE 283: face, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his
LINE 284: desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his
LINE 285: fire.
LINE 286: "Now, Pip," said he, "be careful."
LINE 287: "I will, sir," I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what
LINE 288: I was going to say.
LINE 289: "Don't commit yourself," said Mr. Jaggers, "and don't commit any one.
LINE 290: You understand—any one. Don't tell me anything: I don't want to know
LINE 291: anything; I am not curious."
LINE 292: Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.
LINE 293: "I merely want, Mr. Jaggers," said I, "to assure myself that what I
LINE 294: have been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at
LINE 295: least I may verify it."
LINE 296: Mr. Jaggers nodded. "But did you say 'told' or 'informed'?" he asked
LINE 297: me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a
LINE 298: listening way at the floor. "Told would seem to imply verbal
LINE 299: communication. You can't have verbal communication with a man in New
LINE 300: South Wales, you know."
LINE 301: "I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers."
LINE 302: "Good."
LINE 303: "I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the
LINE 304: benefactor so long unknown to me."
LINE 305: "That is the man," said Mr. Jaggers, "in New South Wales."
LINE 306: "And only he?" said I.
LINE 307: "And only he," said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 308: "I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for
LINE 309: my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss
LINE 310: Havisham."
LINE 311: "As you say, Pip," returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me
LINE 312: coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, "I am not at all
LINE 313: responsible for that."
LINE 314: "And yet it looked so like it, sir," I pleaded with a downcast heart.
LINE 315: "Not a particle of evidence, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head
LINE 316: and gathering up his skirts. "Take nothing on its looks; take
LINE 317: everything on evidence. There's no better rule."
LINE 318: "I have no more to say," said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for
LINE 319: a little while. "I have verified my information, and there's an end."
LINE 320: "And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,"
LINE 321: said Mr. Jaggers, "you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my
LINE 322: communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of
LINE 323: fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of
LINE 324: fact. You are quite aware of that?"
LINE 325: "Quite, sir."
LINE 326: "I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote to
LINE 327: me—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever to
LINE 328: deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him
LINE 329: another caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his
LINE 330: letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I
LINE 331: cautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all
LINE 332: likely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his
LINE 333: natural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be
LINE 334: an act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the
LINE 335: law. I gave Magwitch that caution," said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at
LINE 336: me; "I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt."
LINE 337: "No doubt," said I.
LINE 338: "I have been informed by Wemmick," pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking
LINE 339: hard at me, "that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from
LINE 340: a colonist of the name of Purvis, or—"
LINE 341: "Or Provis," I suggested.
LINE 342: "Or Provis—thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know
LINE 343: it's Provis?"
LINE 344: "Yes," said I.
LINE 345: "You know it's Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist
LINE 346: of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on
LINE 347: behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by
LINE 348: return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received
LINE 349: the explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?"
LINE 350: "It came through Provis," I replied.
LINE 351: "Good day, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; "glad to have
LINE 352: seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or in
LINE 353: communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention
LINE 354: that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to
LINE 355: you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.
LINE 356: Good-day, Pip!"
LINE 357: We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I
LINE 358: turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two
LINE 359: vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,
LINE 360: and to force out of their swollen throats, "O, what a man he is!"
LINE 361: Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done
LINE 362: nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the
LINE 363: terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in
LINE 364: safety.
LINE 365: Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.
LINE 366: Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than
LINE 367: what he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him
LINE 368: that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed
LINE 369: him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching
LINE 370: fugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly
LINE 371: referable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar
LINE 372: to me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there
LINE 373: were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was
LINE 374: Convict in the very grain of the man.
LINE 375: The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gave
LINE 376: him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the
LINE 377: influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,
LINE 378: his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways
LINE 379: of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about in
LINE 380: a high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn-handled
LINE 381: jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of lifting
LINE 382: light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy
LINE 383: pannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it
LINE 384: the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make
LINE 385: the most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and
LINE 386: then swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless
LINE 387: instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,
LINE 388: Bondsman, plain as plain could be.
LINE 389: It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had
LINE 390: conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the
LINE 391: effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
LINE 392: the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it
LINE 393: was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of
LINE 394: pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It
LINE 395: was abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut
LINE 396: short.
LINE 397: Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful
LINE 398: mystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his
LINE 399: knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head
LINE 400: tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit
LINE 401: and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all
LINE 402: the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to
LINE 403: start up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of
LINE 404: him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the
LINE 405: first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for
LINE 406: me and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon
LINE 407: come back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and
LINE 408: begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave
LINE 409: him there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a
LINE 410: private soldier.
LINE 411: I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those
LINE 412: lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and
LINE 413: the rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and
LINE 414: hanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the
LINE 415: dread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he
LINE 416: was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged
LINE 417: pack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, and
LINE 418: in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the
LINE 419: table,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would
LINE 420: ask me to read to him,—"Foreign language, dear boy!" While I complied,
LINE 421: he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire
LINE 422: surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between
LINE 423: the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb
LINE 424: show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary
LINE 425: student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was
LINE 426: not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and
LINE 427: recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me
LINE 428: and the fonder he was of me.
LINE 429: This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It
LINE 430: lasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go
LINE 431: out, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one
LINE 432: evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite
LINE 433: worn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
LINE 434: dreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,
LINE 435: who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an
LINE 436: instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.
LINE 437: "Quiet! It's Herbert!" I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the
LINE 438: airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.
LINE 439: "Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again
LINE 440: how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must
LINE 441: have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my—Halloa! I
LINE 442: beg your pardon."
LINE 443: He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by
LINE 444: seeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly
LINE 445: putting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something
LINE 446: else.
LINE 447: "Herbert, my dear friend," said I, shutting the double doors, while
LINE 448: Herbert stood staring and wondering, "something very strange has
LINE 449: happened. This is—a visitor of mine."
LINE 450: "It's all right, dear boy!" said Provis coming forward, with his little
LINE 451: clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. "Take it in
LINE 452: your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in
LINE 453: any way sumever! Kiss it!"
LINE 454: "Do so, as he wishes it," I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me
LINE 455: with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis
LINE 456: immediately shaking hands with him, said, "Now you're on your oath, you
LINE 457: know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on
LINE 458: you!"
