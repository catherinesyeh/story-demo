LINE 1: In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of
LINE 2: Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I
LINE 3: recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings
LINE 4: reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance
LINE 5: towards the man who had done so much for me.
LINE 6: What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there
LINE 7: had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.
LINE 8: Saving his troublesome sense of having been "low" on one occasion since
LINE 9: his return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the
LINE 10: moment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of the
LINE 11: possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast
LINE 12: that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support
LINE 13: the character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as
LINE 14: for himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,
LINE 15: and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite
LINE 16: established in his own mind.
LINE 17: "Though, look'ee here, Pip's comrade," he said to Herbert, after having
LINE 18: discoursed for some time, "I know very well that once since I come
LINE 19: back—for half a minute—I've been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had
LINE 20: been low. But don't you fret yourself on that score. I ain't made Pip a
LINE 21: gentleman, and Pip ain't a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur me
LINE 22: not to know what's due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip's comrade, you two
LINE 23: may count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on. Muzzled I have
LINE 24: been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled
LINE 25: I am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be."
LINE 26: Herbert said, "Certainly," but looked as if there were no specific
LINE 27: consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were
LINE 28: anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us
LINE 29: together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat
LINE 30: late. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and saw
LINE 31: him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I
LINE 32: experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of
LINE 33: his arrival.
LINE 34: Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I
LINE 35: had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in
LINE 36: bringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a
LINE 37: large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is
LINE 38: conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that
LINE 39: any of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who
LINE 40: were passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty
LINE 41: when I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate
LINE 42: with us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the
LINE 43: fountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,
LINE 44: when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I
LINE 45: lived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and
LINE 46: lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.
LINE 47: Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so
LINE 48: blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound
LINE 49: words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the
LINE 50: question, What was to be done?
LINE 51: The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had
LINE 52: stood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in
LINE 53: one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with
LINE 54: his pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,
LINE 55: and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say his
LINE 56: chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but
LINE 57: next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had
LINE 58: no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my
LINE 59: patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that
LINE 60: confidence without shaping a syllable.
LINE 61: "What," said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,—"what is
LINE 62: to be done?"
LINE 63: "My poor dear Handel," he replied, holding his head, "I am too stunned
LINE 64: to think."
LINE 65: "So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be
LINE 66: done. He is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages,
LINE 67: and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow."
LINE 68: "You mean that you can't accept—"
LINE 69: "How can I?" I interposed, as Herbert paused. "Think of him! Look at
LINE 70: him!"
LINE 71: An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.
LINE 72: "Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to
LINE 73: me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!"
LINE 74: "My poor dear Handel," Herbert repeated.
LINE 75: "Then," said I, "after all, stopping short here, never taking another
LINE 76: penny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily
LINE 77: in debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I have
LINE 78: been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing."
LINE 79: "Well, well, well!" Herbert remonstrated. "Don't say fit for nothing."
LINE 80: "What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that
LINE 81: is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but
LINE 82: for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection."
LINE 83: Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a
LINE 84: warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.
LINE 85: "Anyhow, my dear Handel," said he presently, "soldiering won't do. If
LINE 86: you were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you
LINE 87: would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
LINE 88: already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!
LINE 89: Besides, it's absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's
LINE 90: house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you
LINE 91: know."
LINE 92: Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.
LINE 93: "But there is another question," said Herbert. "This is an ignorant,
LINE 94: determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he
LINE 95: seems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce
LINE 96: character."
LINE 97: "I know he is," I returned. "Let me tell you what evidence I have seen
LINE 98: of it." And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of
LINE 99: that encounter with the other convict.
LINE 100: "See, then," said Herbert; "think of this! He comes here at the peril
LINE 101: of his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of
LINE 102: realisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from
LINE 103: under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.
LINE 104: Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?"
LINE 105: "I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night
LINE 106: of his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his
LINE 107: putting himself in the way of being taken."
LINE 108: "Then you may rely upon it," said Herbert, "that there would be great
LINE 109: danger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he
LINE 110: remains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you
LINE 111: forsook him."
LINE 112: I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me
LINE 113: from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard
LINE 114: myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my
LINE 115: chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that
LINE 116: even if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I should
LINE 117: be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so
LINE 118: wretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would
LINE 119: far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I
LINE 120: would ever have come to this!
LINE 121: But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?
LINE 122: "The first and the main thing to be done," said Herbert, "is to get him
LINE 123: out of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be
LINE 124: induced to go."
LINE 125: "But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?"
LINE 126: "My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next
LINE 127: street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to
LINE 128: him and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get
LINE 129: him away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything
LINE 130: else in his life, now."
LINE 131: "There, again!" said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands
LINE 132: held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. "I know
LINE 133: nothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night
LINE 134: and see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,
LINE 135: and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified
LINE 136: me two days in my childhood!"
LINE 137: Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and
LINE 138: fro together, studying the carpet.
LINE 139: "Handel," said Herbert, stopping, "you feel convinced that you can take
LINE 140: no further benefits from him; do you?"
LINE 141: "Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?"
LINE 142: "And you feel convinced that you must break with him?"
LINE 143: "Herbert, can you ask me?"
LINE 144: "And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he
LINE 145: has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from
LINE 146: throwing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir
LINE 147: a finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in
LINE 148: Heaven's name, and we'll see it out together, dear old boy."
LINE 149: It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,
LINE 150: with only that done.
LINE 151: "Now, Herbert," said I, "with reference to gaining some knowledge of
LINE 152: his history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point
LINE 153: blank."
LINE 154: "Yes. Ask him," said Herbert, "when we sit at breakfast in the
LINE 155: morning." For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would
LINE 156: come to breakfast with us.
LINE 157: With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams
LINE 158: concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear
LINE 159: which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned
LINE 160: transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.
LINE 161: He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat
LINE 162: down to his meal. He was full of plans "for his gentleman's coming out
LINE 163: strong, and like a gentleman," and urged me to begin speedily upon the
LINE 164: pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the
LINE 165: chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to
LINE 166: look out at once for a "fashionable crib" near Hyde Park, in which he
LINE 167: could have "a shake-down." When he had made an end of his breakfast,
LINE 168: and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of
LINE 169: preface,—
LINE 170: "After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that
LINE 171: the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You
LINE 172: remember?"
LINE 173: "Remember!" said he. "I think so!"
LINE 174: "We want to know something about that man—and about you. It is strange
LINE 175: to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to
LINE 176: tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
LINE 177: more?"
LINE 178: "Well!" he said, after consideration. "You're on your oath, you know,
LINE 179: Pip's comrade?"
LINE 180: "Assuredly," replied Herbert.
LINE 181: "As to anything I say, you know," he insisted. "The oath applies to
LINE 182: all."
LINE 183: "I understand it to do so."
LINE 184: "And look'ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for," he
LINE 185: insisted again.
LINE 186: "So be it."
LINE 187: He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,
LINE 188: when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think
LINE 189: it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,
LINE 190: stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each
LINE 191: knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent
LINE 192: moments, looked round at us and said what follows.
