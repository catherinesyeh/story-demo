LINE 1: My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.
LINE 2: The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman
LINE 3: on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the
LINE 4: more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt
LINE 5: that the pale young gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law
LINE 6: would avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I
LINE 7: had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go
LINE 8: stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and
LINE 9: pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves
LINE 10: open to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,
LINE 11: and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and
LINE 12: trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County
LINE 13: Jail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman's nose had stained
LINE 14: my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the
LINE 15: dead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman's
LINE 16: teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I
LINE 17: devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance
LINE 18: when I should be haled before the Judges.
LINE 19: When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
LINE 20: violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of
LINE 21: Justice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush
LINE 22: behind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal
LINE 23: vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those
LINE 24: grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whether
LINE 25: suborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall
LINE 26: upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was high
LINE 27: testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,
LINE 28: that I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they
LINE 29: always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,
LINE 30: goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the
LINE 31: family features.
LINE 32: However, go to Miss Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold!
LINE 33: nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,
LINE 34: and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I
LINE 35: found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in
LINE 36: at the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped
LINE 37: by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner
LINE 38: where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the
LINE 39: young gentleman's existence. There were traces of his gore in that
LINE 40: spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.
LINE 41: On the broad landing between Miss Havisham's own room and that other
LINE 42: room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a
LINE 43: light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed
LINE 44: there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular
LINE 45: occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired
LINE 46: of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and
LINE 47: across the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over
LINE 48: again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as
LINE 49: long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general
LINE 50: mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled
LINE 51: that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,
LINE 52: and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten
LINE 53: months.
LINE 54: As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more
LINE 55: to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I
LINE 56: going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I
LINE 57: believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
LINE 58: everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
LINE 59: desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer
LINE 60: my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anything
LINE 61: but my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my
LINE 62: services.
LINE 63: Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told
LINE 64: me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;
LINE 65: sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite
LINE 66: familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she
LINE 67: hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we
LINE 68: were alone, "Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?" And when I said
LINE 69: yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when
LINE 70: we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish
LINE 71: of Estella's moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods
LINE 72: were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled
LINE 73: what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish
LINE 74: fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like "Break their
LINE 75: hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!"
LINE 76: There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which
LINE 77: the burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of
LINE 78: rendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in
LINE 79: that relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure
LINE 80: of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the
LINE 81: introduction of Old Clem's respected name. Thus, you were to hammer
LINE 82: boys round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat it out,
LINE 83: beat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow the
LINE 84: fire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!
LINE 85: One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly
LINE 86: saying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, "There,
LINE 87: there, there! Sing!" I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I
LINE 88: pushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she
LINE 89: took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.
LINE 90: After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,
LINE 91: and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so
LINE 92: subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in
LINE 93: the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.
LINE 94: What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character
LINE 95: fail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts
LINE 96: were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light
LINE 97: from the misty yellow rooms?
LINE 98: Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had
LINE 99: not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I
LINE 100: had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly
LINE 101: fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger
LINE 102: to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of
LINE 103: him. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella
LINE 104: discussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more
LINE 105: potent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but
LINE 106: Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to
LINE 107: do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did
LINE 108: not know then, though I think I know now.
LINE 109: Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost
LINE 110: insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,
LINE 111: Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
LINE 112: discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to
LINE 113: this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these
LINE 114: hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would
LINE 115: have done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of
LINE 116: mind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before
LINE 117: him,—as it were, to operate upon,—and he would drag me up from my stool
LINE 118: (usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me
LINE 119: before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,
LINE 120: "Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by
LINE 121: hand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which
LINE 122: so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!" And then he would
LINE 123: rumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, as
LINE 124: already hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any
LINE 125: fellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before him by the sleeve,—a
LINE 126: spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.
LINE 127: Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
LINE 128: about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,
LINE 129: that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly
LINE 130: at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister
LINE 131: spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
LINE 132: every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,
LINE 133: would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of
LINE 134: my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.
LINE 135: In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,
LINE 136: while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he
LINE 137: was not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old
LINE 138: enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on
LINE 139: his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my
LINE 140: sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into
LINE 141: opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out
LINE 142: of his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating
LINE 143: end to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to
LINE 144: lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching
LINE 145: sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, "Come!
LINE 146: there's enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_'ve given trouble
LINE 147: enough for one night, I hope!" As if I had besought them as a favour to
LINE 148: bother my life out.
LINE 149: We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we
LINE 150: should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss
LINE 151: Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my
LINE 152: shoulder; and said with some displeasure,—
LINE 153: "You are growing tall, Pip!"
LINE 154: I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,
LINE 155: that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no
LINE 156: control.
LINE 157: She said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at
LINE 158: me again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and
LINE 159: moody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was
LINE 160: over, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a
LINE 161: movement of her impatient fingers:—
LINE 162: "Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours."
LINE 163: "Joe Gargery, ma'am."
LINE 164: "Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?"
LINE 165: "Yes, Miss Havisham."
LINE 166: "You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with
LINE 167: you, and bring your indentures, do you think?"
LINE 168: I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be
LINE 169: asked.
LINE 170: "Then let him come."
LINE 171: "At any particular time, Miss Havisham?"
LINE 172: "There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come
LINE 173: along with you."
LINE 174: When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister
LINE 175: "went on the Rampage," in a more alarming degree than at any previous
LINE 176: period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats
LINE 177: under our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we
LINE 178: graciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent
LINE 179: of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud
LINE 180: sobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put on
LINE 181: her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not
LINE 182: satisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,
LINE 183: and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the
LINE 184: back-yard. It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in
LINE 185: again, and then she asked Joe why he hadn't married a Negress Slave at
LINE 186: once? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker
LINE 187: and looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have
LINE 188: been a better speculation.
