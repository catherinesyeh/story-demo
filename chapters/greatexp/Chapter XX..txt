LINE 1: The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
LINE 2: hours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by
LINE 3: which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
LINE 4: the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.
LINE 5: We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was
LINE 6: treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:
LINE 7: otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I
LINE 8: might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,
LINE 9: crooked, narrow, and dirty.
LINE 10: Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and
LINE 11: he had written after it on his card, "just out of Smithfield, and close
LINE 12: by the coach-office." Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to
LINE 13: have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed
LINE 14: me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier
LINE 15: of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on
LINE 16: his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old
LINE 17: weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a
LINE 18: work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets
LINE 19: outside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many footmen to
LINE 20: hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from
LINE 21: yielding to the temptation.
LINE 22: I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
LINE 23: straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the
LINE 24: horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman
LINE 25: beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop
LINE 26: we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open
LINE 27: door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.
LINE 28: "How much?" I asked the coachman.
LINE 29: The coachman answered, "A shilling—unless you wish to make it more."
LINE 30: I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.
LINE 31: "Then it must be a shilling," observed the coachman. "I don't want to
LINE 32: get into trouble. _I_ know _him_!" He darkly closed an eye at Mr.
LINE 33: Jaggers's name, and shook his head.
LINE 34: When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the
LINE 35: ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his
LINE 36: mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
LINE 37: hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?
LINE 38: "He is not," returned the clerk. "He is in Court at present. Am I
LINE 39: addressing Mr. Pip?"
LINE 40: I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.
LINE 41: "Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn't say how
LINE 42: long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time
LINE 43: being valuable, that he won't be longer than he can help."
LINE 44: With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner
LINE 45: chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a
LINE 46: velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
LINE 47: being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.
LINE 48: "Go and wait outside, Mike," said the clerk.
LINE 49: I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk
LINE 50: shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,
LINE 51: and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.
LINE 52: Mr. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most
LINE 53: dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,
LINE 54: and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted
LINE 55: themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers
LINE 56: about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd
LINE 57: objects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old
LINE 58: rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and
LINE 59: packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly
LINE 60: swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed
LINE 61: chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,
LINE 62: like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and
LINE 63: bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the
LINE 64: clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the
LINE 65: wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with
LINE 66: shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled
LINE 67: forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being
LINE 68: turned out.
LINE 69: I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's
LINE 70: chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I
LINE 71: called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
LINE 72: everybody else's disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many
LINE 73: other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have
LINE 74: the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what
LINE 75: was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came
LINE 76: there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's
LINE 77: family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
LINE 78: ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the
LINE 79: blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.
LINE 80: Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits
LINE 81: may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and
LINE 82: grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in
LINE 83: Mr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts
LINE 84: on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.
LINE 85: When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I
LINE 86: waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into
LINE 87: Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being
LINE 88: all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to
LINE 89: me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a
LINE 90: street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me
LINE 91: from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate
LINE 92: Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered
LINE 93: with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and
LINE 94: from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits
LINE 95: and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.
LINE 96: While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
LINE 97: minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a
LINE 98: trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half
LINE 99: a crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice
LINE 100: in his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and
LINE 101: presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I
LINE 102: declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as
LINE 103: to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also
LINE 104: where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors'
LINE 105: Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest
LINE 106: of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that "four on 'em"
LINE 107: would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the
LINE 108: morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a
LINE 109: sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's
LINE 110: proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his
LINE 111: pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not
LINE 112: belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had
LINE 113: bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought
LINE 114: myself well rid of him for a shilling.
LINE 115: I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I
LINE 116: found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour
LINE 117: of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became
LINE 118: aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as
LINE 119: I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew
LINE 120: Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
LINE 121: pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when
LINE 122: they first passed me, that "Jaggers would do it if it was to be done."
LINE 123: There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and
LINE 124: one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted
LINE 125: her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, "Jaggers
LINE 126: is for him, 'Melia, and what more _could_ you have?" There was a
LINE 127: red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering
LINE 128: there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;
LINE 129: and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a
LINE 130: highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a
LINE 131: lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the
LINE 132: words, "O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,
LINE 133: give me Jaggerth!" These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian
LINE 134: made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than
LINE 135: ever.
LINE 136: At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close
LINE 137: into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards
LINE 138: me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there
LINE 139: was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and
LINE 140: walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed
LINE 141: himself to his followers.
LINE 142: First, he took the two secret men.
LINE 143: "Now, I have nothing to say to _you_," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his
LINE 144: finger at them. "I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,
LINE 145: it's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you
LINE 146: paid Wemmick?"
LINE 147: "We made the money up this morning, sir," said one of the men,
LINE 148: submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.
LINE 149: "I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it
LINE 150: up at all. Has Wemmick got it?"
LINE 151: "Yes, sir," said both the men together.
LINE 152: "Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!" said Mr Jaggers,
LINE 153: waving his hand at them to put them behind him. "If you say a word to
LINE 154: me, I'll throw up the case."
LINE 155: "We thought, Mr. Jaggers—" one of the men began, pulling off his hat.
LINE 156: "That's what I told you not to do," said Mr. Jaggers. "_You_ thought! I
LINE 157: think for you; that's enough for you. If I want you, I know where to
LINE 158: find you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it. I won't
LINE 159: hear a word."
LINE 160: The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind
LINE 161: again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.
LINE 162: "And now _you_!" said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on
LINE 163: the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly
LINE 164: separated,—"Oh! Amelia, is it?"
LINE 165: "Yes, Mr. Jaggers."
LINE 166: "And do you remember," retorted Mr. Jaggers, "that but for me you
LINE 167: wouldn't be here and couldn't be here?"
LINE 168: "O yes, sir!" exclaimed both women together. "Lord bless you, sir, well
LINE 169: we knows that!"
LINE 170: "Then why," said Mr. Jaggers, "do you come here?"
LINE 171: "My Bill, sir!" the crying woman pleaded.
LINE 172: "Now, I tell you what!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Once for all. If you don't
LINE 173: know that your Bill's in good hands, I know it. And if you come here
LINE 174: bothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and
LINE 175: you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?"
LINE 176: "O yes, sir! Every farden."
LINE 177: "Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another
LINE 178: word—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back."
LINE 179: This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No
LINE 180: one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the
LINE 181: skirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his lips several times.
LINE 182: "I don't know this man!" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating
LINE 183: strain: "What does this fellow want?"
LINE 184: "Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?"
LINE 185: "Who's he?" said Mr. Jaggers. "Let go of my coat."
LINE 186: The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing
LINE 187: it, replied, "Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate."
LINE 188: "You're too late," said Mr. Jaggers. "I am over the way."
LINE 189: "Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!" cried my excitable acquaintance,
LINE 190: turning white, "don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!"
LINE 191: "I am," said Mr. Jaggers, "and there's an end of it. Get out of the
LINE 192: way."
LINE 193: "Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen'th gone to Mithter
LINE 194: Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter
LINE 195: Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you'd have the condethenthun
LINE 196: to be bought off from the t'other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money
LINE 197: no object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!"
LINE 198: My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and
LINE 199: left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further
LINE 200: interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and
LINE 201: the man in velveteen with the fur cap.
LINE 202: "Here's Mike," said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and
LINE 203: approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.
LINE 204: "Oh!" said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of
LINE 205: hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling
LINE 206: at the bell-rope; "your man comes on this afternoon. Well?"
LINE 207: "Well, Mas'r Jaggers," returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a
LINE 208: constitutional cold; "arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as
LINE 209: might do."
LINE 210: "What is he prepared to swear?"
LINE 211: "Well, Mas'r Jaggers," said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this
LINE 212: time; "in a general way, anythink."
LINE 213: Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. "Now, I warned you before,"
LINE 214: said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, "that if you
LINE 215: ever presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you. You
LINE 216: infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?"
LINE 217: The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious
LINE 218: what he had done.
LINE 219: "Spooney!" said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his
LINE 220: elbow. "Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?"
LINE 221: "Now, I ask you, you blundering booby," said my guardian, very sternly,
LINE 222: "once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is
LINE 223: prepared to swear?"
LINE 224: Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson
LINE 225: from his face, and slowly replied, "Ayther to character, or to having
LINE 226: been in his company and never left him all the night in question."
LINE 227: "Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?"
LINE 228: Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the
LINE 229: ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before
LINE 230: beginning to reply in a nervous manner, "We've dressed him up like—"
LINE 231: when my guardian blustered out,—
LINE 232: "What? You WILL, will you?"
LINE 233: ("Spooney!" added the clerk again, with another stir.)
LINE 234: After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—
LINE 235: "He is dressed like a 'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook."
LINE 236: "Is he here?" asked my guardian.
LINE 237: "I left him," said Mike, "a setting on some doorsteps round the
LINE 238: corner."
LINE 239: "Take him past that window, and let me see him."
LINE 240: The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,
LINE 241: behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an
LINE 242: accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short
LINE 243: suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was
LINE 244: not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of
LINE 245: recovery, which was painted over.
LINE 246: "Tell him to take his witness away directly," said my guardian to the
LINE 247: clerk, in extreme disgust, "and ask him what he means by bringing such
LINE 248: a fellow as that."
LINE 249: My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,
LINE 250: standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed
LINE 251: to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements
LINE 252: he had made for me. I was to go to "Barnard's Inn," to young Mr.
LINE 253: Pocket's rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I
LINE 254: was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go
LINE 255: with him to his father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked
LINE 256: it. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal
LINE 257: one,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards
LINE 258: of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,
LINE 259: and such other things as I could in reason want. "You will find your
LINE 260: credit good, Mr. Pip," said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt
LINE 261: like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, "but I shall by
LINE 262: this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find
LINE 263: you outrunning the constable. Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but
LINE 264: that's no fault of mine."
LINE 265: After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked
LINE 266: Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth
LINE 267: while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,
LINE 268: if I pleased.
LINE 269: I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk
LINE 270: was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I
LINE 271: accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.
LINE 272: We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way
LINE 273: among them by saying coolly yet decisively, "I tell you it's no use; he
LINE 274: won't have a word to say to one of you;" and we soon got clear of them,
LINE 275: and went on side by side.
