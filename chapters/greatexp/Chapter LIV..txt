LINE 1: It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind
LINE 2: blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. We
LINE 3: had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly
LINE 4: possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
LINE 5: bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were
LINE 6: questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for
LINE 7: it was wholly set on Provis's safety. I only wondered for the passing
LINE 8: moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered
LINE 9: circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.
LINE 10: We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if
LINE 11: we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had
LINE 12: taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After
LINE 13: a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two
LINE 14: or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went
LINE 15: on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then
LINE 16: about high-water,—half-past eight.
LINE 17: Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being
LINE 18: with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,
LINE 19: and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long
LINE 20: reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is
LINE 21: broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and
LINE 22: where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we
LINE 23: could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all
LINE 24: night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would
LINE 25: start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at
LINE 26: what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail
LINE 27: the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we
LINE 28: should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each
LINE 29: vessel.
LINE 30: The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was
LINE 31: so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in
LINE 32: which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the
LINE 33: movement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ran
LINE 34: with us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us
LINE 35: on,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use
LINE 36: in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,
LINE 37: and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.
LINE 38: At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present
LINE 39: extent, and watermen's boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing
LINE 40: colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but
LINE 41: of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so
LINE 42: many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and
LINE 43: there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;
LINE 44: the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a
LINE 45: much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and
LINE 46: we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.
LINE 47: Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its
LINE 48: oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor's Gate, and
LINE 49: we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,
LINE 50: and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking
LINE 51: immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were
LINE 52: colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off
LINE 53: stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,
LINE 54: which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her
LINE 55: moorings was to-morrow's steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good
LINE 56: notice; and here to-morrow's for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we
LINE 57: crossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster
LINE 58: beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.
LINE 59: "Is he there?" said Herbert.
LINE 60: "Not yet."
LINE 61: "Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his
LINE 62: signal?"
LINE 63: "Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see him! Pull both.
LINE 64: Easy, Herbert. Oars!"
LINE 65: We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,
LINE 66: and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas
LINE 67: bag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.
LINE 68: "Dear boy!" he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his
LINE 69: seat. "Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!"
LINE 70: Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty
LINE 71: chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the
LINE 72: moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and
LINE 73: shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the
LINE 74: figure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds
LINE 75: (as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firm
LINE 76: formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her
LINE 77: head; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders' yards, saws going at
LINE 78: timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky
LINE 79: ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible
LINE 80: sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent
LINE 81: lightermen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where the
LINE 82: ships' boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled
LINE 83: waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly
LINE 84: out to the wind.
LINE 85: At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had
LINE 86: looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We
LINE 87: certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not
LINE 88: either attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by
LINE 89: any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,
LINE 90: or to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any
LINE 91: appearance of molestation.
LINE 92: He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural
LINE 93: part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he
LINE 94: had led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.
LINE 95: He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his
LINE 96: gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not
LINE 97: disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no
LINE 98: notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted
LINE 99: it, but it must come before he troubled himself.
LINE 100: "If you knowed, dear boy," he said to me, "what it is to sit here
LINE 101: alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day
LINE 102: betwixt four walls, you'd envy me. But you don't know what it is."
LINE 103: "I think I know the delights of freedom," I answered.
LINE 104: "Ah," said he, shaking his head gravely. "But you don't know it equal
LINE 105: to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it
LINE 106: equal to me,—but I ain't a-going to be low."
LINE 107: It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he
LINE 108: should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected
LINE 109: that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the
LINE 110: habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I
LINE 111: was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:—
LINE 112: "You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t'other side the world, I
LINE 113: was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for
LINE 114: all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could
LINE 115: come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about
LINE 116: him. They ain't so easy concerning me here, dear boy,—wouldn't be,
LINE 117: leastwise, if they knowed where I was."
LINE 118: "If all goes well," said I, "you will be perfectly free and safe again
LINE 119: within a few hours."
LINE 120: "Well," he returned, drawing a long breath, "I hope so."
LINE 121: "And think so?"
LINE 122: He dipped his hand in the water over the boat's gunwale, and said,
LINE 123: smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—
LINE 124: "Ay, I s'pose I think so, dear boy. We'd be puzzled to be more quiet
LINE 125: and easy-going than we are at present. But—it's a flowing so soft and
LINE 126: pleasant through the water, p'raps, as makes me think it—I was a
LINE 127: thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the
LINE 128: bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this
LINE 129: river what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can't no more hold their tide
LINE 130: than I can hold this. And it's run through my fingers and gone, you
LINE 131: see!" holding up his dripping hand.
LINE 132: "But for your face I should think you were a little despondent," said
LINE 133: I.
LINE 134: "Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of
LINE 135: that there rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune.
LINE 136: Maybe I'm a growing a trifle old besides."
LINE 137: He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of
LINE 138: face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
LINE 139: England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been
LINE 140: in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
LINE 141: into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he
LINE 142: would be safest where he was, and he said. "Do you, dear boy?" and
LINE 143: quietly sat down again.
LINE 144: The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the
LINE 145: sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose
LINE 146: none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By
LINE 147: imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of
LINE 148: the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the
LINE 149: muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.
LINE 150: As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a
LINE 151: boat or two's length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch
LINE 152: the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a
LINE 153: large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And
LINE 154: soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,
LINE 155: and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking
LINE 156: advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us
LINE 157: in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of
LINE 158: the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and
LINE 159: mudbanks.
LINE 160: Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive
LINE 161: with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour's rest
LINE 162: proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery
LINE 163: stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It
LINE 164: was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim
LINE 165: horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great
LINE 166: floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed
LINE 167: stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round
LINE 168: the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,
LINE 169: straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some
LINE 170: ballast-lighters, shaped like a child's first rude imitation of a boat,
LINE 171: lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles
LINE 172: stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes
LINE 173: stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red
LINE 174: landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage
LINE 175: and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was
LINE 176: stagnation and mud.
LINE 177: We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder
LINE 178: work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and
LINE 179: rowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a
LINE 180: little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on
LINE 181: the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into
LINE 182: black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were
LINE 183: the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,
LINE 184: save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.
LINE 185: As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,
LINE 186: would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for
LINE 187: clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could
LINE 188: find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for
LINE 189: anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or
LINE 190: five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with
LINE 191: her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.
LINE 192: The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and
LINE 193: what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as
LINE 194: the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.
LINE 195: At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we
LINE 196: were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular
LINE 197: intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or
LINE 198: other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and
LINE 199: there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
LINE 200: creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them
LINE 201: nervously. Sometimes, "What was that ripple?" one of us would say in a
LINE 202: low voice. Or another, "Is that a boat yonder?" And afterwards we would
LINE 203: fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with
LINE 204: what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.
LINE 205: At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran
LINE 206: alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
LINE 207: by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light
LINE 208: to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I
LINE 209: dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good
LINE 210: fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various
LINE 211: liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—"such as
LINE 212: they were," the landlord said. No other company was in the house than
LINE 213: the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the "Jack" of the
LINE 214: little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been
LINE 215: low-water mark too.
LINE 216: With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came
LINE 217: ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all
LINE 218: else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the
LINE 219: kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop
LINE 220: were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as
LINE 221: carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there
LINE 222: were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have
LINE 223: thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,
LINE 224: notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.
LINE 225: While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the
LINE 226: Jack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes
LINE 227: on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as
LINE 228: interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a
LINE 229: drowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oared
LINE 230: galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must
LINE 231: have gone down then, and yet she "took up too," when she left there.
LINE 232: "They must ha' thought better on't for some reason or another," said
LINE 233: the Jack, "and gone down."
LINE 234: "A four-oared galley, did you say?" said I.
LINE 235: "A four," said the Jack, "and two sitters."
LINE 236: "Did they come ashore here?"
LINE 237: "They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I'd ha' been
LINE 238: glad to pison the beer myself," said the Jack, "or put some rattling
LINE 239: physic in it."
LINE 240: "Why?"
LINE 241: "_I_ know why," said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much
LINE 242: mud had washed into his throat.
LINE 243: "He thinks," said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale
LINE 244: eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,—"he thinks they was, what
LINE 245: they wasn't."
LINE 246: "_I_ knows what I thinks," observed the Jack.
LINE 247: "_You_ thinks Custom 'Us, Jack?" said the landlord.
LINE 248: "I do," said the Jack.
LINE 249: "Then you're wrong, Jack."
LINE 250: "AM I!"
LINE 251: In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in
LINE 252: his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,
LINE 253: knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on
LINE 254: again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he
LINE 255: could afford to do anything.
LINE 256: "Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,
LINE 257: Jack?" asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.
LINE 258: "Done with their buttons?" returned the Jack. "Chucked 'em overboard.
LINE 259: Swallered 'em. Sowed 'em, to come up small salad. Done with their
LINE 260: buttons!"
LINE 261: "Don't be cheeky, Jack," remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and
LINE 262: pathetic way.
LINE 263: "A Custom 'Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons," said the
LINE 264: Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, "when
LINE 265: they comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don't
LINE 266: go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and
LINE 267: both with and against another, without there being Custom 'Us at the
LINE 268: bottom of it." Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,
LINE 269: having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the
LINE 270: subject.
LINE 271: This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind
LINE 272: was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and
LINE 273: I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley
LINE 274: hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an
LINE 275: ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced
LINE 276: Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop
LINE 277: by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.
LINE 278: Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer's time,
LINE 279: which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off
LINE 280: early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we
LINE 281: deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour
LINE 282: or so of the steamer's time, and then to get out in her track, and
LINE 283: drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into
LINE 284: the house and went to bed.
LINE 285: I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a
LINE 286: few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house
LINE 287: (the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled
LINE 288: me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the
LINE 289: window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,
LINE 290: as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw
LINE 291: two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at
LINE 292: nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I
LINE 293: could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction
LINE 294: of the Nore.
LINE 295: My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going
LINE 296: away. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back
LINE 297: of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder
LINE 298: day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I
LINE 299: could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I
LINE 300: soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the
LINE 301: matter, and fell asleep again.
LINE 302: We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before
LINE 303: breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our
LINE 304: charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the
LINE 305: men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no
LINE 306: thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,
LINE 307: it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away
LINE 308: together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take
LINE 309: us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about
LINE 310: noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he
LINE 311: and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.
LINE 312: He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me
LINE 313: on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in
LINE 314: danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As
LINE 315: we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,
LINE 316: while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had
LINE 317: passed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no
LINE 318: boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were
LINE 319: there any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the
LINE 320: tide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.
LINE 321: When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I
LINE 322: waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;
LINE 323: sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving
LINE 324: about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got
LINE 325: aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that
LINE 326: time it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock, and we began to look out
LINE 327: for her smoke.
LINE 328: But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards
LINE 329: we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on
LINE 330: at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of
LINE 331: saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands
LINE 332: cordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I
LINE 333: saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
LINE 334: ahead of us, and row out into the same track.
LINE 335: A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke,
LINE 336: by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,
LINE 337: coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the
LINE 338: tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to
LINE 339: sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, "Trust to
LINE 340: me, dear boy," and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was
LINE 341: very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and
LINE 342: fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,
LINE 343: she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or
LINE 344: two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and
LINE 345: looked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter was
LINE 346: wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some
LINE 347: instruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in
LINE 348: either boat.
LINE 349: Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,
LINE 350: and gave me the word "Hamburg," in a low voice, as we sat face to face.
LINE 351: She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew
LINE 352: louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,
LINE 353: when the galley hailed us. I answered.
LINE 354: "You have a returned Transport there," said the man who held the lines.
LINE 355: "That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,
LINE 356: otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,
LINE 357: and you to assist."
LINE 358: At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,
LINE 359: he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke
LINE 360: ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on
LINE 361: to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great
LINE 362: confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and
LINE 363: heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but
LINE 364: felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw
LINE 365: the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner's shoulder,
LINE 366: and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,
LINE 367: and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
LINE 368: frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,
LINE 369: lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the
LINE 370: shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that
LINE 371: the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.
LINE 372: Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white
LINE 373: terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board
LINE 374: the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink
LINE 375: from under me.
LINE 376: It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand
LINE 377: mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was
LINE 378: taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;
LINE 379: but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.
LINE 380: What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of
LINE 381: her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first
LINE 382: distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the
LINE 383: galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong
LINE 384: strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and
LINE 385: eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,
LINE 386: bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up
LINE 387: his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and
LINE 388: true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,
LINE 389: but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled
LINE 390: at the wrists and ankles.
LINE 391: The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water
LINE 392: was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not
LINE 393: understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had
LINE 394: been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and
LINE 395: we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out
LINE 396: was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were
LINE 397: gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.
LINE 398: At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
LINE 399: we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.
LINE 400: Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis no
LINE 401: longer,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a
LINE 402: deep cut in the head.
LINE 403: He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
LINE 404: steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to
LINE 405: his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought
LINE 406: he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did
LINE 407: not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,
LINE 408: but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify
LINE 409: him, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had
LINE 410: both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him
LINE 411: (Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him
LINE 412: in it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down
LINE 413: fiercely locked in each other's arms, and that there had been a
LINE 414: struggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,
LINE 415: and swum away.
LINE 416: I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told
LINE 417: me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their
LINE 418: going overboard.
LINE 419: When I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's wet
LINE 420: clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the
LINE 421: public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take
LINE 422: charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book
LINE 423: which had once been in my hands passed into the officer's. He further
LINE 424: gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to
LINE 425: accord that grace to my two friends.
LINE 426: The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
LINE 427: down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
LINE 428: likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to
LINE 429: be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it
LINE 430: took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may
LINE 431: have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in
LINE 432: various stages of decay.
LINE 433: We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then
LINE 434: Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and
LINE 435: Startop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a
LINE 436: doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt
LINE 437: that that was my place henceforth while he lived.
LINE 438: For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,
LINE 439: wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man
LINE 440: who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,
LINE 441: gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a
LINE 442: series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to
LINE 443: Joe.
LINE 444: His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,
LINE 445: and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm
LINE 446: I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I
LINE 447: could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was
LINE 448: unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,
LINE 449: people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not
LINE 450: doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had
LINE 451: been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken
LINE 452: prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation
LINE 453: under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who
LINE 454: was the cause of his arrest.
LINE 455: As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,
LINE 456: and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how
LINE 457: grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.
LINE 458: "Dear boy," he answered, "I'm quite content to take my chance. I've
LINE 459: seen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me."
LINE 460: No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.
LINE 461: Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick's hint now.
LINE 462: I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to
LINE 463: the Crown.
LINE 464: "Lookee here, dear boy," said he "It's best as a gentleman should not
LINE 465: be knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by
LINE 466: chance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for
LINE 467: the last o' many times, and I don't ask no more."
LINE 468: "I will never stir from your side," said I, "when I am suffered to be
LINE 469: near you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!"
LINE 470: I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away as
LINE 471: he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his
LINE 472: throat,—softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing
LINE 473: that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might
LINE 474: not otherwise have thought of until too late,—that he need never know
LINE 475: how his hopes of enriching me had perished.
