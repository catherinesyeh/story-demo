LINE 1: After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and
LINE 2: had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had
LINE 3: ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk
LINE 4: together. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he
LINE 5: referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed
LINE 6: for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my
LINE 7: destiny if I could "hold my own" with the average of young men in
LINE 8: prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to
LINE 9: the contrary.
LINE 10: He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition
LINE 11: of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the
LINE 12: functions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that
LINE 13: with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,
LINE 14: and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his
LINE 15: way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself
LINE 16: on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state
LINE 17: at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his
LINE 18: compact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling
LINE 19: mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no
LINE 20: doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no
LINE 21: such excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever
LINE 22: regard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but what
LINE 23: was serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.
LINE 24: When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had
LINE 25: begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my
LINE 26: bedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my
LINE 27: manners would be none the worse for Herbert's society. Mr. Pocket did
LINE 28: not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could
LINE 29: possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt
LINE 30: that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would
LINE 31: save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted
LINE 32: my wish to Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 33: "If I could buy the furniture now hired for me," said I, "and one or
LINE 34: two other little things, I should be quite at home there."
LINE 35: "Go it!" said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. "I told you you'd get
LINE 36: on. Well! How much do you want?"
LINE 37: I said I didn't know how much.
LINE 38: "Come!" retorted Mr. Jaggers. "How much? Fifty pounds?"
LINE 39: "O, not nearly so much."
LINE 40: "Five pounds?" said Mr. Jaggers.
LINE 41: This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, "O, more than
LINE 42: that."
LINE 43: "More than that, eh!" retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with
LINE 44: his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the
LINE 45: wall behind me; "how much more?"
LINE 46: "It is so difficult to fix a sum," said I, hesitating.
LINE 47: "Come!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Let's get at it. Twice five; will that do?
LINE 48: Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?"
LINE 49: I said I thought that would do handsomely.
LINE 50: "Four times five will do handsomely, will it?" said Mr. Jaggers,
LINE 51: knitting his brows. "Now, what do you make of four times five?"
LINE 52: "What do I make of it?"
LINE 53: "Ah!" said Mr. Jaggers; "how much?"
LINE 54: "I suppose you make it twenty pounds," said I, smiling.
LINE 55: "Never mind what _I_ make it, my friend," observed Mr. Jaggers, with a
LINE 56: knowing and contradictory toss of his head. "I want to know what _you_
LINE 57: make it."
LINE 58: "Twenty pounds, of course."
LINE 59: "Wemmick!" said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. "Take Mr. Pip's
LINE 60: written order, and pay him twenty pounds."
LINE 61: This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked
LINE 62: impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never
LINE 63: laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising
LINE 64: himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows
LINE 65: joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to
LINE 66: creak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened
LINE 67: to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to
LINE 68: Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers's manner.
LINE 69: "Tell him that, and he'll take it as a compliment," answered Wemmick;
LINE 70: "he don't mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.—Oh!" for I
LINE 71: looked surprised, "it's not personal; it's professional: only
LINE 72: professional."
LINE 73: Wemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit;
LINE 74: pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as
LINE 75: if he were posting them.
LINE 76: "Always seems to me," said Wemmick, "as if he had set a man-trap and
LINE 77: was watching it. Suddenly—click—you're caught!"
LINE 78: Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,
LINE 79: I said I supposed he was very skilful?
LINE 80: "Deep," said Wemmick, "as Australia." Pointing with his pen at the
LINE 81: office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the
LINE 82: purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the
LINE 83: globe. "If there was anything deeper," added Wemmick, bringing his pen
LINE 84: to paper, "he'd be it."
LINE 85: Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,
LINE 86: "Ca-pi-tal!" Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he
LINE 87: replied,—
LINE 88: "We don't run much into clerks, because there's only one Jaggers, and
LINE 89: people won't have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would
LINE 90: you like to see 'em? You are one of us, as I may say."
LINE 91: I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the
LINE 92: post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of
LINE 93: which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his
LINE 94: coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark
LINE 95: and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.
LINE 96: Jaggers's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase
LINE 97: for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something
LINE 98: between a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollen
LINE 99: man—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby
LINE 100: appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to
LINE 101: be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers's coffers. "Getting evidence
LINE 102: together," said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, "for the Bailey." In the
LINE 103: room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair
LINE 104: (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was
LINE 105: similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented
LINE 106: to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt
LINE 107: me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,
LINE 108: as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a
LINE 109: high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was
LINE 110: dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been
LINE 111: waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of
LINE 112: the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers's own use.
LINE 113: This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick
LINE 114: led me into my guardian's room, and said, "This you've seen already."
LINE 115: "Pray," said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
LINE 116: caught my sight again, "whose likenesses are those?"
LINE 117: "These?" said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off
LINE 118: the horrible heads before bringing them down. "These are two celebrated
LINE 119: ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap
LINE 120: (why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the
LINE 121: inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered
LINE 122: his master, and, considering that he wasn't brought up to evidence,
LINE 123: didn't plan it badly."
LINE 124: "Is it like him?" I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat
LINE 125: upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.
LINE 126: "Like him? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,
LINE 127: directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,
LINE 128: hadn't you, Old Artful?" said Wemmick. He then explained this
LINE 129: affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady
LINE 130: and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,
LINE 131: "Had it made for me, express!"
LINE 132: "Is the lady anybody?" said I.
LINE 133: "No," returned Wemmick. "Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,
LINE 134: didn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except
LINE 135: one,—and she wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't
LINE 136: have caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to
LINE 137: drink in it." Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he
LINE 138: put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his
LINE 139: pocket-handkerchief.
LINE 140: "Did that other creature come to the same end?" I asked. "He has the
LINE 141: same look."
LINE 142: "You're right," said Wemmick; "it's the genuine look. Much as if one
LINE 143: nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he
LINE 144: came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He
LINE 145: forged wills, this blade did, if he didn't also put the supposed
LINE 146: testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though" (Mr.
LINE 147: Wemmick was again apostrophising), "and you said you could write Greek.
LINE 148: Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!"
LINE 149: Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the
LINE 150: largest of his mourning rings and said, "Sent out to buy it for me,
LINE 151: only the day before."
LINE 152: While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,
LINE 153: the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived
LINE 154: from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I
LINE 155: ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood
LINE 156: before me, dusting his hands.
LINE 157: "O yes," he returned, "these are all gifts of that kind. One brings
LINE 158: another, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're
LINE 159: curiosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but,
LINE 160: after all, they're property and portable. It don't signify to you with
LINE 161: your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,
LINE 162: 'Get hold of portable property'."
LINE 163: When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a
LINE 164: friendly manner:—
LINE 165: "If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn't
LINE 166: mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I
LINE 167: should consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two
LINE 168: or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I
LINE 169: am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house."
LINE 170: I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.
LINE 171: "Thankee," said he; "then we'll consider that it's to come off, when
LINE 172: convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?"
LINE 173: "Not yet."
LINE 174: "Well," said Wemmick, "he'll give you wine, and good wine. I'll give
LINE 175: you punch, and not bad punch. And now I'll tell you something. When you
LINE 176: go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper."
LINE 177: "Shall I see something very uncommon?"
LINE 178: "Well," said Wemmick, "you'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very
LINE 179: uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original
LINE 180: wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won't lower your
LINE 181: opinion of Mr. Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it."
LINE 182: I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his
LINE 183: preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I
LINE 184: would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers "at it?"
LINE 185: For several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know what
LINE 186: Mr. Jaggers would be found to be "at," I replied in the affirmative. We
LINE 187: dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a
LINE 188: blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the
LINE 189: fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably
LINE 190: chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or
LINE 191: cross-examination,—I don't know which,—and was striking her, and the
LINE 192: bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever
LINE 193: degree, said a word that he didn't approve of, he instantly required to
LINE 194: have it "taken down." If anybody wouldn't make an admission, he said,
LINE 195: "I'll have it out of you!" and if anybody made an admission, he said,
LINE 196: "Now I have got you!" The magistrates shivered under a single bite of
LINE 197: his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his
LINE 198: words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their
LINE 199: direction. Which side he was on I couldn't make out, for he seemed to
LINE 200: me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I
LINE 201: stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was
LINE 202: making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive
LINE 203: under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the
LINE 204: representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.
