LINE 1: Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be
LINE 2: traced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state
LINE 3: of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
LINE 4: before meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which
LINE 5: I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,
LINE 6: and the returned transport whom I harboured? The road would be none the
LINE 7: smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not
LINE 8: be helped, nor I extenuated.
LINE 9: A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,
LINE 10: his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
LINE 11: there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could
LINE 12: hardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of
LINE 13: him, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any
LINE 14: such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
LINE 15: himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
LINE 16: informer was scarcely to be imagined.
LINE 17: Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe—or so I resolved—a word
LINE 18: of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could go
LINE 19: abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we
LINE 20: were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.
LINE 21: I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.
LINE 22: On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley's, Estella's maid was called
LINE 23: to tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House,
LINE 24: as usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there
LINE 25: without me; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation
LINE 26: in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that
LINE 27: her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. I
LINE 28: could make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make
LINE 29: nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.
LINE 30: Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I
LINE 31: always took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the
LINE 32: conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came
LINE 33: back from Miss Havisham's. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to
LINE 34: consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should
LINE 35: devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious
LINE 36: observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should
LINE 37: propose an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything,
LINE 38: and he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his
LINE 39: present hazard was not to be thought of.
LINE 40: Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise
LINE 41: to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe
LINE 42: or his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and
LINE 43: Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be
LINE 44: absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his
LINE 45: impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be
LINE 46: begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert
LINE 47: also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that
LINE 48: pretence,—as, to make purchases, or the like.
LINE 49: Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham's, I set
LINE 50: off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on
LINE 51: the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and
LINE 52: whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
LINE 53: mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly
LINE 54: ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,
LINE 55: to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!
LINE 56: As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a
LINE 57: very lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into
LINE 58: the coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I
LINE 59: ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very
LINE 60: well knew why he had come there.
LINE 61: Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had
LINE 62: nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of
LINE 63: coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which
LINE 64: it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly
LINE 65: irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By
LINE 66: degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the
LINE 67: fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my
LINE 68: hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to
LINE 69: stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.
LINE 70: "Is this a cut?" said Mr. Drummle.
LINE 71: "Oh!" said I, poker in hand; "it's you, is it? How do you do? I was
LINE 72: wondering who it was, who kept the fire off."
LINE 73: With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself
LINE 74: side by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the
LINE 75: fire.
LINE 76: "You have just come down?" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away
LINE 77: with his shoulder.
LINE 78: "Yes," said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.
LINE 79: "Beastly place," said Drummle. "Your part of the country, I think?"
LINE 80: "Yes," I assented. "I am told it's very like your Shropshire."
LINE 81: "Not in the least like it," said Drummle.
LINE 82: Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.
LINE 83: Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.
LINE 84: "Have you been here long?" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of
LINE 85: the fire.
LINE 86: "Long enough to be tired of it," returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,
LINE 87: but equally determined.
LINE 88: "Do you stay here long?"
LINE 89: "Can't say," answered Mr. Drummle. "Do you?"
LINE 90: "Can't say," said I.
LINE 91: I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's
LINE 92: shoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have
LINE 93: jerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged
LINE 94: a similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.
LINE 95: He whistled a little. So did I.
LINE 96: "Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?" said Drummle.
LINE 97: "Yes. What of that?" said I.
LINE 98: Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, "Oh!"
LINE 99: and laughed.
LINE 100: "Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?"
LINE 101: "No," said he, "not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the
LINE 102: saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way
LINE 103: villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses—and
LINE 104: smithies—and that. Waiter!"
LINE 105: "Yes, sir."
LINE 106: "Is that horse of mine ready?"
LINE 107: "Brought round to the door, sir."
LINE 108: "I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather
LINE 109: won't do."
LINE 110: "Very good, sir."
LINE 111: "And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's."
LINE 112: "Very good, sir."
LINE 113: Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his
LINE 114: great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so
LINE 115: exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the
LINE 116: robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat
LINE 117: him on the fire.
LINE 118: One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief
LINE 119: came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well
LINE 120: squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our
LINE 121: hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in
LINE 122: the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's
LINE 123: was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both
LINE 124: stood our ground.
LINE 125: "Have you been to the Grove since?" said Drummle.
LINE 126: "No," said I, "I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was
LINE 127: there."
LINE 128: "Was that when we had a difference of opinion?"
LINE 129: "Yes," I replied, very shortly.
LINE 130: "Come, come! They let you off easily enough," sneered Drummle. "You
LINE 131: shouldn't have lost your temper."
LINE 132: "Mr. Drummle," said I, "you are not competent to give advice on that
LINE 133: subject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that
LINE 134: occasion), I don't throw glasses."
LINE 135: "I do," said Drummle.
LINE 136: After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of
LINE 137: smouldering ferocity, I said,—
LINE 138: "Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an
LINE 139: agreeable one."
LINE 140: "I am sure it's not," said he, superciliously over his shoulder; "I
LINE 141: don't think anything about it."
LINE 142: "And therefore," I went on, "with your leave, I will suggest that we
LINE 143: hold no kind of communication in future."
LINE 144: "Quite my opinion," said Drummle, "and what I should have suggested
LINE 145: myself, or done—more likely—without suggesting. But don't lose your
LINE 146: temper. Haven't you lost enough without that?"
LINE 147: "What do you mean, sir?"
LINE 148: "Waiter!" said Drummle, by way of answering me.
LINE 149: The waiter reappeared.
LINE 150: "Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't
LINE 151: ride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?"
LINE 152: "Quite so, sir!"
LINE 153: When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his
LINE 154: hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,
LINE 155: careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket
LINE 156: and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and
LINE 157: boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without
LINE 158: introducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;
LINE 159: and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were
LINE 160: no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have
LINE 161: remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for
LINE 162: the incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waiter, I
LINE 163: think—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and
LINE 164: rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we
LINE 165: were obliged to give way.
LINE 166: I saw him through the window, seizing his horse's mane, and mounting in
LINE 167: his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought
LINE 168: he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in
LINE 169: his mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress
LINE 170: appeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where:
LINE 171: whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummle
LINE 172: leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a
LINE 173: jerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching
LINE 174: shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me
LINE 175: reminded me of Orlick.
LINE 176: Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or
LINE 177: no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the
LINE 178: journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house
LINE 179: that it would have been so much the better for me never to have
LINE 180: entered, never to have seen.
