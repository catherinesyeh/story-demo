LINE 1: He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his
LINE 2: committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken
LINE 3: two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great
LINE 4: pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his
LINE 5: hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke
LINE 6: very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the
LINE 7: first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he
LINE 8: ought to hear.
LINE 9: Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after
LINE 10: the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of
LINE 11: being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his
LINE 12: illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a
LINE 13: determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.
LINE 14: Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the
LINE 15: regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
LINE 16: on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I
LINE 17: do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he
LINE 18: wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day
LINE 19: when the prison door closed upon him.
LINE 20: The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man
LINE 21: who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner
LINE 22: or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered
LINE 23: over the question whether he might have been a better man under better
LINE 24: circumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that
LINE 25: way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.
LINE 26: It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his
LINE 27: desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in
LINE 28: attendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his
LINE 29: eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had
LINE 30: seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was
LINE 31: a little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I
LINE 32: never knew him complain.
LINE 33: When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be
LINE 34: made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It
LINE 35: was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,
LINE 36: and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the
LINE 37: bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting
LINE 38: close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he
LINE 39: stretched forth to me.
LINE 40: The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said
LINE 41: for him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and had
LINE 42: thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that
LINE 43: he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It
LINE 44: was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him
LINE 45: guilty.
LINE 46: At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible
LINE 47: experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing
LINE 48: of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of
LINE 49: Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds
LINE 50: before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that
LINE 51: I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that
LINE 52: sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,
LINE 53: that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.
LINE 54: The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,
LINE 55: down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering
LINE 56: in the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside
LINE 57: it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and
LINE 58: women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and
LINE 59: weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There
LINE 60: had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been
LINE 61: stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains
LINE 62: and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great
LINE 63: gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as the
LINE 64: two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge
LINE 65: addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must
LINE 66: single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had
LINE 67: been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments
LINE 68: and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of
LINE 69: years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had
LINE 70: made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable
LINE 71: man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when
LINE 72: far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a
LINE 73: peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those
LINE 74: propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered
LINE 75: him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and
LINE 76: repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.
LINE 77: Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading
LINE 78: the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of
LINE 79: flight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by express
LINE 80: design, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of his
LINE 81: denouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment
LINE 82: for his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his
LINE 83: case being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.
LINE 84: The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the
LINE 85: glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of
LINE 86: light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,
LINE 87: and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,
LINE 88: with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all
LINE 89: things, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face
LINE 90: in this way of light, the prisoner said, "My Lord, I have received my
LINE 91: sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours," and sat down
LINE 92: again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had
LINE 93: to say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of
LINE 94: them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard
LINE 95: look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three
LINE 96: shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had
LINE 97: taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of
LINE 98: having to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held
LINE 99: my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got
LINE 100: up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),
LINE 101: and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him
LINE 102: and me.
LINE 103: I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder's
LINE 104: Report was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that
LINE 105: night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting
LINE 106: forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my
LINE 107: sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I
LINE 108: had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men
LINE 109: in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the
LINE 110: Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took
LINE 111: no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed
LINE 112: in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away
LINE 113: from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful
LINE 114: and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable
LINE 115: restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,
LINE 116: wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.
LINE 117: To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,
LINE 118: dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and
LINE 119: their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.
LINE 120: The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more
LINE 121: strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an
LINE 122: intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I
LINE 123: sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,
LINE 124: that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the
LINE 125: singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There
LINE 126: was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer
LINE 127: always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick
LINE 128: prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as
LINE 129: sick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be
LINE 130: thanked!) always joined in the same report.
LINE 131: As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly
LINE 132: looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face
LINE 133: until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would
LINE 134: subside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then
LINE 135: he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to
LINE 136: understand his meaning very well.
LINE 137: The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in
LINE 138: him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and
LINE 139: lighted up as I entered.
LINE 140: "Dear boy," he said, as I sat down by his bed: "I thought you was late.
LINE 141: But I knowed you couldn't be that."
LINE 142: "It is just the time," said I. "I waited for it at the gate."
LINE 143: "You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?"
LINE 144: "Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time."
LINE 145: "Thank'ee dear boy, thank'ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me,
LINE 146: dear boy."
LINE 147: I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once
LINE 148: meant to desert him.
LINE 149: "And what's the best of all," he said, "you've been more comfortable
LINE 150: alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.
LINE 151: That's best of all."
LINE 152: He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,
LINE 153: and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and
LINE 154: a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.
LINE 155: "Are you in much pain to-day?"
LINE 156: "I don't complain of none, dear boy."
LINE 157: "You never do complain."
LINE 158: He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to
LINE 159: mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid
LINE 160: it there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.
LINE 161: The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I
LINE 162: found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,
LINE 163: "You needn't go yet." I thanked him gratefully, and asked, "Might I
LINE 164: speak to him, if he can hear me?"
LINE 165: The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,
LINE 166: though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid
LINE 167: look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.
LINE 168: "Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I
LINE 169: say?"
LINE 170: A gentle pressure on my hand.
LINE 171: "You had a child once, whom you loved and lost."
LINE 172: A stronger pressure on my hand.
LINE 173: "She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a
LINE 174: lady and very beautiful. And I love her!"
LINE 175: With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my
LINE 176: yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,
LINE 177: he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying
LINE 178: on it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,
LINE 179: and his head dropped quietly on his breast.
LINE 180: Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men
LINE 181: who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better
LINE 182: words that I could say beside his bed, than "O Lord, be merciful to him
LINE 183: a sinner!"
