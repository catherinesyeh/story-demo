LINE 1: In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles
LINE 2: burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham
LINE 3: seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.
LINE 4: Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both
LINE 5: raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I
LINE 6: derived that, from the look they interchanged.
LINE 7: "And what wind," said Miss Havisham, "blows you here, Pip?"
LINE 8: Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.
LINE 9: Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and
LINE 10: then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as
LINE 11: plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived
LINE 12: I had discovered my real benefactor.
LINE 13: "Miss Havisham," said I, "I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to
LINE 14: Estella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed."
LINE 15: Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,
LINE 16: I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her
LINE 17: occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural
LINE 18: place for me, that day.
LINE 19: "What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,
LINE 20: presently—in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not
LINE 21: displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be."
LINE 22: Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the
LINE 23: action of Estella's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I
LINE 24: said; but she did not look up.
LINE 25: "I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,
LINE 26: and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,
LINE 27: anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not
LINE 28: my secret, but another's."
LINE 29: As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to
LINE 30: go on, Miss Havisham repeated, "It is not your secret, but another's.
LINE 31: Well?"
LINE 32: "When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I
LINE 33: belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I
LINE 34: suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have
LINE 35: come,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid
LINE 36: for it?"
LINE 37: "Ay, Pip," replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; "you did."
LINE 38: "And that Mr. Jaggers—"
LINE 39: "Mr. Jaggers," said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, "had
LINE 40: nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and
LINE 41: his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same
LINE 42: relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that
LINE 43: as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one."
LINE 44: Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no
LINE 45: suppression or evasion so far.
LINE 46: "But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least
LINE 47: you led me on?" said I.
LINE 48: "Yes," she returned, again nodding steadily, "I let you go on."
LINE 49: "Was that kind?"
LINE 50: "Who am I," cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and
LINE 51: flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in
LINE 52: surprise,—"who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?"
LINE 53: It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I
LINE 54: told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.
LINE 55: "Well, well, well!" she said. "What else?"
LINE 56: "I was liberally paid for my old attendance here," I said, to soothe
LINE 57: her, "in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for
LINE 58: my own information. What follows has another (and I hope more
LINE 59: disinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you
LINE 60: punished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses
LINE 61: your intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?"
LINE 62: "I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my
LINE 63: history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you
LINE 64: not to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them."
LINE 65: Waiting until she was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of her in
LINE 66: a wild and sudden way,—I went on.
LINE 67: "I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,
LINE 68: and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them
LINE 69: to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be
LINE 70: false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you
LINE 71: or no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that
LINE 72: you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you
LINE 73: suppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and
LINE 74: incapable of anything designing or mean."
LINE 75: "They are your friends," said Miss Havisham.
LINE 76: "They made themselves my friends," said I, "when they supposed me to
LINE 77: have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and
LINE 78: Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think."
LINE 79: This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do
LINE 80: them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and
LINE 81: then said quietly,—
LINE 82: "What do you want for them?"
LINE 83: "Only," said I, "that you would not confound them with the others. They
LINE 84: may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same
LINE 85: nature."
LINE 86: Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,—
LINE 87: "What do you want for them?"
LINE 88: "I am not so cunning, you see," I said, in answer, conscious that I
LINE 89: reddened a little, "as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,
LINE 90: that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money
LINE 91: to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the
LINE 92: nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you
LINE 93: how."
LINE 94: "Why must it be done without his knowledge?" she asked, settling her
LINE 95: hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.
LINE 96: "Because," said I, "I began the service myself, more than two years
LINE 97: ago, without his knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed. Why I fail
LINE 98: in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the
LINE 99: secret which is another person's and not mine."
LINE 100: She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.
LINE 101: After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of
LINE 102: the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the
LINE 103: collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at
LINE 104: first, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All
LINE 105: this time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her
LINE 106: attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in
LINE 107: our dialogue,—
LINE 108: "What else?"
LINE 109: "Estella," said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my
LINE 110: trembling voice, "you know I love you. You know that I have loved you
LINE 111: long and dearly."
LINE 112: She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her
LINE 113: fingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved
LINE 114: countenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from
LINE 115: her to me.
LINE 116: "I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me
LINE 117: to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought
LINE 118: you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.
LINE 119: But I must say it now."
LINE 120: Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,
LINE 121: Estella shook her head.
LINE 122: "I know," said I, in answer to that action,—"I know. I have no hope
LINE 123: that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become
LINE 124: of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love
LINE 125: you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house."
LINE 126: Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook
LINE 127: her head again.
LINE 128: "It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise
LINE 129: on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all
LINE 130: these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected
LINE 131: on the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,
LINE 132: in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella."
LINE 133: I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she
LINE 134: sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.
LINE 135: "It seems," said Estella, very calmly, "that there are sentiments,
LINE 136: fancies,—I don't know how to call them,—which I am not able to
LINE 137: comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form
LINE 138: of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch
LINE 139: nothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to
LINE 140: warn you of this; now, have I not?"
LINE 141: I said in a miserable manner, "Yes."
LINE 142: "Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.
LINE 143: Now, did you not think so?"
LINE 144: "I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and
LINE 145: beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature."
LINE 146: "It is in _my_ nature," she returned. And then she added, with a stress
LINE 147: upon the words, "It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great
LINE 148: difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can
LINE 149: do no more."
LINE 150: "Is it not true," said I, "that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and
LINE 151: pursuing you?"
LINE 152: "It is quite true," she replied, referring to him with the indifference
LINE 153: of utter contempt.
LINE 154: "That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with
LINE 155: you this very day?"
LINE 156: She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,
LINE 157: "Quite true."
LINE 158: "You cannot love him, Estella!"
LINE 159: Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,
LINE 160: "What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do
LINE 161: not mean what I say?"
LINE 162: "You would never marry him, Estella?"
LINE 163: She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her
LINE 164: work in her hands. Then she said, "Why not tell you the truth? I am
LINE 165: going to be married to him."
LINE 166: I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better
LINE 167: than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear
LINE 168: her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a
LINE 169: ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my
LINE 170: passionate hurry and grief.
LINE 171: "Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this
LINE 172: fatal step. Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—but
LINE 173: bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham
LINE 174: gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done
LINE 175: to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly
LINE 176: love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as
LINE 177: dearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can
LINE 178: bear it better, for your sake!"
LINE 179: My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have
LINE 180: been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all
LINE 181: intelligible to her own mind.
LINE 182: "I am going," she said again, in a gentler voice, "to be married to
LINE 183: him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be
LINE 184: married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by
LINE 185: adoption? It is my own act."
LINE 186: "Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?"
LINE 187: "On whom should I fling myself away?" she retorted, with a smile.
LINE 188: "Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if
LINE 189: people do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is
LINE 190: done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me
LINE 191: into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me
LINE 192: wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which
LINE 193: has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say
LINE 194: no more. We shall never understand each other."
LINE 195: "Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!" I urged, in despair.
LINE 196: "Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him," said Estella; "I shall
LINE 197: not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary
LINE 198: boy—or man?"
LINE 199: "O Estella!" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do
LINE 200: what I would to restrain them; "even if I remained in England and could
LINE 201: hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?"
LINE 202: "Nonsense," she returned,—"nonsense. This will pass in no time."
LINE 203: "Never, Estella!"
LINE 204: "You will get me out of your thoughts in a week."
LINE 205: "Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You
LINE 206: have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the
LINE 207: rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been
LINE 208: in every prospect I have ever seen since,—on the river, on the sails of
LINE 209: the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the
LINE 210: darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You
LINE 211: have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever
LINE 212: become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London
LINE 213: buildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be
LINE 214: displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to
LINE 215: me, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my
LINE 216: life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the
LINE 217: little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I
LINE 218: associate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to
LINE 219: that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me
LINE 220: feel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!"
LINE 221: In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,
LINE 222: I don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an
LINE 223: inward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering
LINE 224: moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soon
LINE 225: afterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merely
LINE 226: with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand
LINE 227: still covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
LINE 228: pity and remorse.
LINE 229: All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at
LINE 230: the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when I
LINE 231: went in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and
LINE 232: then struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time
LINE 233: come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the
LINE 234: inn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach
LINE 235: and be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as
LINE 236: tire myself out.
LINE 237: It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow
LINE 238: intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
LINE 239: Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was
LINE 240: close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till
LINE 241: to-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could
LINE 242: get to bed myself without disturbing him.
LINE 243: As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the
LINE 244: Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it
LINE 245: ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held
LINE 246: the gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I
LINE 247: mentioned my name.
LINE 248: "I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here's a note, sir. The
LINE 249: messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my
LINE 250: lantern?"
LINE 251: [Illustration]
LINE 252: Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to
LINE 253: Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the
LINE 254: words, "PLEASE READ THIS, HERE." I opened it, the watchman holding up
LINE 255: his light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,—
LINE 256: "DON'T GO HOME."
