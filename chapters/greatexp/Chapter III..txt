LINE 1: It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the
LINE 2: outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there
LINE 3: all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw
LINE 4: the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort
LINE 5: of spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.
LINE 6: On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so
LINE 7: thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our
LINE 8: village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came
LINE 9: there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I
LINE 10: looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience
LINE 11: like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.
LINE 12: The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that
LINE 13: instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.
LINE 14: This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and
LINE 15: banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly
LINE 16: as could be, "A boy with somebody else's pork pie! Stop him!" The
LINE 17: cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,
LINE 18: and steaming out of their nostrils, "Halloa, young thief!" One black
LINE 19: ox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience
LINE 20: something of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and
LINE 21: moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved
LINE 22: round, that I blubbered out to him, "I couldn't help it, sir! It wasn't
LINE 23: for myself I took it!" Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of
LINE 24: smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and
LINE 25: a flourish of his tail.
LINE 26: All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I
LINE 27: went, I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,
LINE 28: as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I
LINE 29: knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there
LINE 30: on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that
LINE 31: when I was 'prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks
LINE 32: there! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last
LINE 33: too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the
LINE 34: river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes
LINE 35: that staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I
LINE 36: had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and
LINE 37: had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man
LINE 38: sitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,
LINE 39: and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.
LINE 40: I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,
LINE 41: in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on
LINE 42: the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but
LINE 43: another man!
LINE 44: And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great iron
LINE 45: on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that
LINE 46: the other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat
LINE 47: broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for
LINE 48: I had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at
LINE 49: me,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
LINE 50: down, for it made him stumble,—and then he ran into the mist, stumbling
LINE 51: twice as he went, and I lost him.
LINE 52: "It's the young man!" I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified
LINE 53: him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had
LINE 54: known where it was.
LINE 55: I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right
LINE 56: man,—hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all
LINE 57: night left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me. He was awfully
LINE 58: cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face
LINE 59: and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that
LINE 60: when I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it
LINE 61: occurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my
LINE 62: bundle. He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,
LINE 63: but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my
LINE 64: pockets.
LINE 65: "What's in the bottle, boy?" said he.
LINE 66: "Brandy," said I.
LINE 67: He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
LINE 68: manner,—more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
LINE 69: hurry, than a man who was eating it,—but he left off to take some of
LINE 70: the liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite
LINE 71: as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his
LINE 72: teeth, without biting it off.
LINE 73: "I think you have got the ague," said I.
LINE 74: "I'm much of your opinion, boy," said he.
LINE 75: "It's bad about here," I told him. "You've been lying out on the
LINE 76: meshes, and they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too."
LINE 77: "I'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me," said he. "I'd do
LINE 78: that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
LINE 79: over there, directly afterwards. I'll beat the shivers so far, I'll bet
LINE 80: you."
LINE 81: He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all
LINE 82: at once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round
LINE 83: us, and often stopping—even stopping his jaws—to listen. Some real or
LINE 84: fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
LINE 85: marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,—
LINE 86: "You're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?"
LINE 87: "No, sir! No!"
LINE 88: "Nor giv' no one the office to follow you?"
LINE 89: "No!"
LINE 90: "Well," said he, "I believe you. You'd be but a fierce young hound
LINE 91: indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched
LINE 92: warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint
LINE 93: is!"
LINE 94: Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,
LINE 95: and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over
LINE 96: his eyes.
LINE 97: Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down
LINE 98: upon the pie, I made bold to say, "I am glad you enjoy it."
LINE 99: "Did you speak?"
LINE 100: "I said I was glad you enjoyed it."
LINE 101: "Thankee, my boy. I do."
LINE 102: I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now
LINE 103: noticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the
LINE 104: man's. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He
LINE 105: swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;
LINE 106: and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought
LINE 107: there was danger in every direction of somebody's coming to take the
LINE 108: pie away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to
LINE 109: appreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with
LINE 110: him, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of
LINE 111: which particulars he was very like the dog.
LINE 112: "I am afraid you won't leave any of it for him," said I, timidly; after
LINE 113: a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making
LINE 114: the remark. "There's no more to be got where that came from." It was
LINE 115: the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.
LINE 116: "Leave any for him? Who's him?" said my friend, stopping in his
LINE 117: crunching of pie-crust.
LINE 118: "The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you."
LINE 119: "Oh ah!" he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. "Him? Yes,
LINE 120: yes! _He_ don't want no wittles."
LINE 121: "I thought he looked as if he did," said I.
LINE 122: The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and
LINE 123: the greatest surprise.
LINE 124: "Looked? When?"
LINE 125: "Just now."
LINE 126: "Where?"
LINE 127: "Yonder," said I, pointing; "over there, where I found him nodding
LINE 128: asleep, and thought it was you."
LINE 129: He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his
LINE 130: first idea about cutting my throat had revived.
LINE 131: "Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat," I explained, trembling;
LINE 132: "and—and"—I was very anxious to put this delicately—"and with—the same
LINE 133: reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn't you hear the cannon last
LINE 134: night?"
LINE 135: "Then there _was_ firing!" he said to himself.
LINE 136: "I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that," I returned, "for we
LINE 137: heard it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in
LINE 138: besides."
LINE 139: "Why, see now!" said he. "When a man's alone on these flats, with a
LINE 140: light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears
LINE 141: nothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees
LINE 142: the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried
LINE 143: afore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself
LINE 144: challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders 'Make
LINE 145: ready! Present! Cover him steady, men!' and is laid hands on—and
LINE 146: there's nothin'! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming up
LINE 147: in order, Damn 'em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred. And as to
LINE 148: firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad
LINE 149: day,—But this man"; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my
LINE 150: being there; "did you notice anything in him?"
LINE 151: "He had a badly bruised face," said I, recalling what I hardly knew I
LINE 152: knew.
LINE 153: "Not here?" exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,
LINE 154: with the flat of his hand.
LINE 155: "Yes, there!"
LINE 156: "Where is he?" He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of
LINE 157: his grey jacket. "Show me the way he went. I'll pull him down, like a
LINE 158: bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,
LINE 159: boy."
LINE 160: I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and
LINE 161: he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet
LINE 162: grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding
LINE 163: his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which
LINE 164: he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.
LINE 165: I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself
LINE 166: into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping
LINE 167: away from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice,
LINE 168: so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw
LINE 169: of him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his
LINE 170: fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last
LINE 171: I heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still
LINE 172: going.
