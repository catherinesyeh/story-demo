LINE 1: For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily
LINE 2: eyes,—though they had both been often before my fancy in the
LINE 3: East,—when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I
LINE 4: laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it
LINE 5: so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking
LINE 6: his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as
LINE 7: strong as ever, though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced into
LINE 8: the corner with Joe's leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking
LINE 9: at the fire, was—I again!
LINE 10: "We giv' him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap," said Joe,
LINE 11: delighted, when I took another stool by the child's side (but I did
LINE 12: _not_ rumple his hair), "and we hoped he might grow a little bit like
LINE 13: you, and we think he do."
LINE 14: I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we
LINE 15: talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took
LINE 16: him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,
LINE 17: and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
LINE 18: memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife
LINE 19: of the Above.
LINE 20: "Biddy," said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little
LINE 21: girl lay sleeping in her lap, "you must give Pip to me one of these
LINE 22: days; or lend him, at all events."
LINE 23: "No, no," said Biddy, gently. "You must marry."
LINE 24: "So Herbert and Clara say, but I don't think I shall, Biddy. I have so
LINE 25: settled down in their home, that it's not at all likely. I am already
LINE 26: quite an old bachelor."
LINE 27: Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips,
LINE 28: and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into
LINE 29: mine. There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of
LINE 30: Biddy's wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.
LINE 31: "Dear Pip," said Biddy, "you are sure you don't fret for her?"
LINE 32: "O no,—I think not, Biddy."
LINE 33: "Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?
LINE 34: "My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
LINE 35: foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But
LINE 36: that poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,—all
LINE 37: gone by!"
LINE 38: Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly
LINE 39: intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for
LINE 40: her sake. Yes, even so. For Estella's sake.
LINE 41: I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being
LINE 42: separated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and
LINE 43: who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice,
LINE 44: brutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband,
LINE 45: from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This
LINE 46: release had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew,
LINE 47: she was married again.
LINE 48: The early dinner hour at Joe's, left me abundance of time, without
LINE 49: hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.
LINE 50: But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
LINE 51: of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.
LINE 52: There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the
LINE 53: wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a
LINE 54: rough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had
LINE 55: struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A
LINE 56: gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.
LINE 57: A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet
LINE 58: up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the
LINE 59: moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where
LINE 60: every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,
LINE 61: and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was
LINE 62: looking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure
LINE 63: in it.
LINE 64: The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving
LINE 65: towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the
LINE 66: figure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,
LINE 67: when it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if
LINE 68: much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,—
LINE 69: "Estella!"
LINE 70: "I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me."
LINE 71: The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable
LINE 72: majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,
LINE 73: I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,
LINE 74: softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was
LINE 75: the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.
LINE 76: We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, "After so many years,
LINE 77: it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our
LINE 78: first meeting was! Do you often come back?"
LINE 79: "I have never been here since."
LINE 80: "Nor I."
LINE 81: The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white
LINE 82: ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought
LINE 83: of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had
LINE 84: heard on earth.
LINE 85: Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.
LINE 86: "I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been
LINE 87: prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!"
LINE 88: The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and
LINE 89: the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing
LINE 90: that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she
LINE 91: said quietly,—
LINE 92: "Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in
LINE 93: this condition?"
LINE 94: "Yes, Estella."
LINE 95: "The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not
LINE 96: relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I
LINE 97: have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I
LINE 98: made in all the wretched years."
LINE 99: "Is it to be built on?"
LINE 100: "At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And
LINE 101: you," she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,—"you
LINE 102: live abroad still?"
LINE 103: "Still."
LINE 104: "And do well, I am sure?"
LINE 105: "I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore—yes, I do
LINE 106: well."
LINE 107: "I have often thought of you," said Estella.
LINE 108: "Have you?"
LINE 109: "Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from
LINE 110: me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant
LINE 111: of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the
LINE 112: admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart."
LINE 113: "You have always held your place in my heart," I answered.
LINE 114: And we were silent again until she spoke.
LINE 115: "I little thought," said Estella, "that I should take leave of you in
LINE 116: taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so."
LINE 117: "Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,
LINE 118: the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and
LINE 119: painful."
LINE 120: "But you said to me," returned Estella, very earnestly, "'God bless
LINE 121: you, God forgive you!' And if you could say that to me then, you will
LINE 122: not hesitate to say that to me now,—now, when suffering has been
LINE 123: stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what
LINE 124: your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a
LINE 125: better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me
LINE 126: we are friends."
LINE 127: "We are friends," said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from
LINE 128: the bench.
LINE 129: "And will continue friends apart," said Estella.
LINE 130: I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as
LINE 131: the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so
LINE 132: the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of
LINE 133: tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting
LINE 134: from her.
