LINE 1: My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
LINE 2: infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
LINE 3: than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
LINE 4: I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his
LINE 5: tombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.
LINE 6: As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of
LINE 7: either of them (for their days were long before the days of
LINE 8: photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were
LINE 9: unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on
LINE 10: my father's, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,
LINE 11: with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,
LINE 12: "_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_," I drew a childish conclusion that
LINE 13: my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each
LINE 14: about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
LINE 15: their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
LINE 16: mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that
LINE 17: universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously
LINE 18: entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands
LINE 19: in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state
LINE 20: of existence.
LINE 21: Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river
LINE 22: wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad
LINE 23: impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on
LINE 24: a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out
LINE 25: for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the
LINE 26: churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also
LINE 27: Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,
LINE 28: Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the
LINE 29: aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness
LINE 30: beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,
LINE 31: with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low
LINE 32: leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from
LINE 33: which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of
LINE 34: shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.
LINE 35: "Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
LINE 36: among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you
LINE 37: little devil, or I'll cut your throat!"
LINE 38: A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man
LINE 39: with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his
LINE 40: head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and
LINE 41: lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by
LINE 42: briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose
LINE 43: teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.
LINE 44: "Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir," I pleaded in terror. "Pray don't do it,
LINE 45: sir."
LINE 46: "Tell us your name!" said the man. "Quick!"
LINE 47: "Pip, sir."
LINE 48: "Once more," said the man, staring at me. "Give it mouth!"
LINE 49: "Pip. Pip, sir."
LINE 50: "Show us where you live," said the man. "Pint out the place!"
LINE 51: I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the
LINE 52: alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
LINE 53: The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
LINE 54: emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.
LINE 55: When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he
LINE 56: made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my
LINE 57: feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high
LINE 58: tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.
LINE 59: [Illustration]
LINE 60: "You young dog," said the man, licking his lips, "what fat cheeks you
LINE 61: ha' got."
LINE 62: I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my
LINE 63: years, and not strong.
LINE 64: "Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em," said the man, with a threatening shake
LINE 65: of his head, "and if I han't half a mind to't!"
LINE 66: I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the
LINE 67: tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;
LINE 68: partly, to keep myself from crying.
LINE 69: "Now lookee here!" said the man. "Where's your mother?"
LINE 70: "There, sir!" said I.
LINE 71: He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.
LINE 72: "There, sir!" I timidly explained. "Also Georgiana. That's my mother."
LINE 73: "Oh!" said he, coming back. "And is that your father alonger your
LINE 74: mother?"
LINE 75: "Yes, sir," said I; "him too; late of this parish."
LINE 76: "Ha!" he muttered then, considering. "Who d'ye live with,—supposin'
LINE 77: you're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?"
LINE 78: "My sister, sir,—Mrs. Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,
LINE 79: sir."
LINE 80: "Blacksmith, eh?" said he. And looked down at his leg.
LINE 81: After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to
LINE 82: my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he
LINE 83: could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,
LINE 84: and mine looked most helplessly up into his.
LINE 85: "Now lookee here," he said, "the question being whether you're to be
LINE 86: let to live. You know what a file is?"
LINE 87: "Yes, sir."
LINE 88: "And you know what wittles is?"
LINE 89: "Yes, sir."
LINE 90: After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a
LINE 91: greater sense of helplessness and danger.
LINE 92: "You get me a file." He tilted me again. "And you get me wittles." He
LINE 93: tilted me again. "You bring 'em both to me." He tilted me again. "Or
LINE 94: I'll have your heart and liver out." He tilted me again.
LINE 95: I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both
LINE 96: hands, and said, "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,
LINE 97: sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more."
LINE 98: He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped
LINE 99: over its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright
LINE 100: position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—
LINE 101: "You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You
LINE 102: bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and
LINE 103: you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your
LINE 104: having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall
LINE 105: be let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no
LINE 106: matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore
LINE 107: out, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am.
LINE 108: There's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I
LINE 109: am a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has
LINE 110: a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his
LINE 111: heart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide
LINE 112: himself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in
LINE 113: bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think
LINE 114: himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and
LINE 115: creep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man
LINE 116: from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I
LINE 117: find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what
LINE 118: do you say?"
LINE 119: I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken
LINE 120: bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in
LINE 121: the morning.
LINE 122: "Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!" said the man.
LINE 123: I said so, and he took me down.
LINE 124: "Now," he pursued, "you remember what you've undertook, and you
LINE 125: remember that young man, and you get home!"
LINE 126: "Goo-good night, sir," I faltered.
LINE 127: "Much of that!" said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. "I
LINE 128: wish I was a frog. Or a eel!"
LINE 129: At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his
LINE 130: arms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limped
LINE 131: towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the
LINE 132: nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked
LINE 133: in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,
LINE 134: stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his
LINE 135: ankle and pull him in.
LINE 136: When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose
LINE 137: legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When
LINE 138: I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of
LINE 139: my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on
LINE 140: again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and
LINE 141: picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into
LINE 142: the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were
LINE 143: heavy or the tide was in.
LINE 144: The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped
LINE 145: to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not
LINE 146: nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long
LINE 147: angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the
LINE 148: river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
LINE 149: prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the
LINE 150: beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a
LINE 151: pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with
LINE 152: some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was
LINE 153: limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,
LINE 154: and come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a
LINE 155: terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their
LINE 156: heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I
LINE 157: looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of
LINE 158: him. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.
