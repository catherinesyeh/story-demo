LINE 1: He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been
LINE 2: immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down
LINE 3: for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,
LINE 4: to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had
LINE 5: meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened
LINE 6: that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could
LINE 7: give the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his
LINE 8: private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and
LINE 9: Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing. It was the
LINE 10: sole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five
LINE 11: minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could
LINE 12: prevent its going against us.
LINE 13: I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the
LINE 14: fate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
LINE 15: having "let it slip through my fingers," and said we must memorialise
LINE 16: by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal
LINE 17: from me that, although there might be many cases in which the
LINE 18: forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this
LINE 19: case to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not
LINE 20: related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;
LINE 21: he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his
LINE 22: apprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I
LINE 23: finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my
LINE 24: heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to
LINE 25: establish one.
LINE 26: There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had
LINE 27: hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some
LINE 28: accurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs. When his body was found, many
LINE 29: miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he
LINE 30: was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still
LINE 31: legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a
LINE 32: banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the
LINE 33: designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of
LINE 34: information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.
LINE 35: Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His
LINE 36: ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but
LINE 37: that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.
LINE 38: After three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over
LINE 39: for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness
LINE 40: came, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial
LINE 41: at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.
LINE 42: It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one
LINE 43: evening, a good deal cast down, and said,—
LINE 44: "My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you."
LINE 45: His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he
LINE 46: thought.
LINE 47: "We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am
LINE 48: very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me."
LINE 49: "Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but
LINE 50: my need is no greater now than at another time."
LINE 51: "You will be so lonely."
LINE 52: "I have not leisure to think of that," said I. "You know that I am
LINE 53: always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I
LINE 54: should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from
LINE 55: him, you know that my thoughts are with him."
LINE 56: The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to
LINE 57: both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.
LINE 58: "My dear fellow," said Herbert, "let the near prospect of our
LINE 59: separation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling you
LINE 60: about yourself. Have you thought of your future?"
LINE 61: "No, for I have been afraid to think of any future."
LINE 62: "But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must
LINE 63: not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few
LINE 64: friendly words go, with me."
LINE 65: "I will," said I.
LINE 66: "In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—"
LINE 67: I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, "A
LINE 68: clerk."
LINE 69: "A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a
LINE 70: clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,
LINE 71: Handel,—in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?"
LINE 72: There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
LINE 73: which after saying "Now, Handel," as if it were the grave beginning of
LINE 74: a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,
LINE 75: stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.
LINE 76: "Clara and I have talked about it again and again," Herbert pursued,
LINE 77: "and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in
LINE 78: her eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come
LINE 79: together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her
LINE 80: husband's friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,
LINE 81: Handel!"
LINE 82: I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could
LINE 83: not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my
LINE 84: mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.
LINE 85: Secondly,—Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my
LINE 86: thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.
LINE 87: "But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury
LINE 88: to your business, leave the question open for a little while—"
LINE 89: "For any while," cried Herbert. "Six months, a year!"
LINE 90: "Not so long as that," said I. "Two or three months at most."
LINE 91: Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,
LINE 92: and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
LINE 93: go away at the end of the week.
LINE 94: "And Clara?" said I.
LINE 95: "The dear little thing," returned Herbert, "holds dutifully to her
LINE 96: father as long as he lasts; but he won't last long. Mrs. Whimple
LINE 97: confides to me that he is certainly going."
LINE 98: "Not to say an unfeeling thing," said I, "he cannot do better than go."
LINE 99: "I am afraid that must be admitted," said Herbert; "and then I shall
LINE 100: come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I
LINE 101: will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed
LINE 102: darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the
LINE 103: red book, and hasn't a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for
LINE 104: the son of my mother!"
LINE 105: On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full of
LINE 106: bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as he sat on one of the
LINE 107: seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note
LINE 108: to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and
LINE 109: over again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name;
LINE 110: for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.
LINE 111: On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an
LINE 112: unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him
LINE 113: alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had
LINE 114: come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of
LINE 115: explanation in reference to that failure.
LINE 116: "The late Compeyson," said Wemmick, "had by little and little got at
LINE 117: the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was
LINE 118: from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people
LINE 119: being always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,
LINE 120: seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I
LINE 121: thought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only
LINE 122: suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,
LINE 123: habitually to deceive his own instruments. You don't blame me, I hope,
LINE 124: Mr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart."
LINE 125: "I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most
LINE 126: earnestly for all your interest and friendship."
LINE 127: "Thank you, thank you very much. It's a bad job," said Wemmick,
LINE 128: scratching his head, "and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a
LINE 129: long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable
LINE 130: property. Dear me!"
LINE 131: "What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property."
LINE 132: "Yes, to be sure," said Wemmick. "Of course, there can be no objection
LINE 133: to your being sorry for him, and I'd put down a five-pound note myself
LINE 134: to get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson
LINE 135: having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and
LINE 136: being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have
LINE 137: been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been
LINE 138: saved. That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't
LINE 139: you see?"
LINE 140: I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of
LINE 141: grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he
LINE 142: was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up
LINE 143: to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—
LINE 144: "What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?"
LINE 145: "Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months."
LINE 146: "These twelve years, more likely," said Wemmick. "Yes. I'm going to
LINE 147: take a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk. More than
LINE 148: that; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me."
LINE 149: I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,
LINE 150: when Wemmick anticipated me.
LINE 151: "I know your engagements," said he, "and I know you are out of sorts,
LINE 152: Mr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
LINE 153: It ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you
LINE 154: (including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn't you
LINE 155: stretch a point and manage it?"
LINE 156: He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little
LINE 157: to do for him. I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and he was so
LINE 158: very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his
LINE 159: particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half
LINE 160: past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.
LINE 161: Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday
LINE 162: morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking
LINE 163: tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two
LINE 164: glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have
LINE 165: been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his
LINE 166: bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.
LINE 167: When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and
LINE 168: were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was
LINE 169: considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it
LINE 170: over his shoulder. "Why, we are not going fishing!" said I. "No,"
LINE 171: returned Wemmick, "but I like to walk with one."
LINE 172: I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went
LINE 173: towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said
LINE 174: suddenly,—
LINE 175: "Halloa! Here's a church!"
LINE 176: There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather
LINE 177: surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,—
LINE 178: "Let's go in!"
LINE 179: We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked
LINE 180: all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,
LINE 181: and getting something out of paper there.
LINE 182: "Halloa!" said he. "Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em
LINE 183: on!"
LINE 184: As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened
LINE 185: to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They
LINE 186: were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side
LINE 187: door, escorting a lady.
LINE 188: "Halloa!" said Wemmick. "Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding."
LINE 189: That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now
LINE 190: engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The
LINE 191: Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the
LINE 192: altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much
LINE 193: difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to
LINE 194: put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the
LINE 195: pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old
LINE 196: gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe
LINE 197: resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to
LINE 198: perfection.
LINE 199: The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at
LINE 200: those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without
LINE 201: preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out
LINE 202: of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, "Halloa! Here's a
LINE 203: ring!"
LINE 204: I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;
LINE 205: while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a
LINE 206: feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of
LINE 207: giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the
LINE 208: clergyman's being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.
LINE 209: When he said, "Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?" the
LINE 210: old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we
LINE 211: had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.
LINE 212: Upon which, the clergyman said again, "WHO giveth this woman to be
LINE 213: married to this man?" The old gentleman being still in a state of most
LINE 214: estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed
LINE 215: voice, "Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?" To which the Aged replied
LINE 216: with great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, "All right, John,
LINE 217: all right, my boy!" And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon
LINE 218: it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely
LINE 219: married that day.
LINE 220: It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church
LINE 221: Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,
LINE 222: and put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,
LINE 223: put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. "_Now_, Mr.
LINE 224: Pip," said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came
LINE 225: out, "let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
LINE 226: wedding-party!"
LINE 227: Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so
LINE 228: away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle
LINE 229: board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
LINE 230: the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer
LINE 231: unwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in
LINE 232: a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,
LINE 233: and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have
LINE 234: done.
LINE 235: We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on
LINE 236: table, Wemmick said, "Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid
LINE 237: of it!" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the
LINE 238: Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I
LINE 239: could.
LINE 240: Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with
LINE 241: him, and wished him joy.
LINE 242: "Thankee!" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. "She's such a manager of
LINE 243: fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for
LINE 244: yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!" calling me back, and speaking low. "This is
LINE 245: altogether a Walworth sentiment, please."
LINE 246: "I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain," said I.
LINE 247: Wemmick nodded. "After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may
LINE 248: as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or
LINE 249: something of the kind."
