LINE 1: The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to
LINE 2: my native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found the
LINE 3: Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a
LINE 4: great change in the Boar's demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated
LINE 5: my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,
LINE 6: the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out
LINE 7: of property.
LINE 8: It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so
LINE 9: often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,
LINE 10: which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and
LINE 11: could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
LINE 12: post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
LINE 13: in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and
LINE 14: the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.
LINE 15: Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled
LINE 16: round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits
LINE 17: of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of
LINE 18: the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to
LINE 19: be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in
LINE 20: whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of
LINE 21: the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were
LINE 22: marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn
LINE 23: down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in
LINE 24: the dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open
LINE 25: gate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger
LINE 26: who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the
LINE 27: casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,
LINE 28: pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so
LINE 29: often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.
LINE 30: When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr.
LINE 31: Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved
LINE 32: in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and
LINE 33: addressed me in the following terms:—
LINE 34: "Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be
LINE 35: expected! what else could be expected!"
LINE 36: As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I
LINE 37: was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.
LINE 38: "William," said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, "put a muffin on table.
LINE 39: And has it come to this! Has it come to this!"
LINE 40: I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me
LINE 41: and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a
LINE 42: benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.
LINE 43: "William," said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, "put the salt on. In
LINE 44: happier times," addressing me, "I think you took sugar? And did you
LINE 45: take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress."
LINE 46: "Thank you," said I, shortly, "but I don't eat watercresses."
LINE 47: "You don't eat 'em," returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his
LINE 48: head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if
LINE 49: abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. "True.
LINE 50: The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William."
LINE 51: I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand
LINE 52: over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.
LINE 53: "Little more than skin and bone!" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. "And
LINE 54: yet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread
LINE 55: afore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!"
LINE 56: This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
LINE 57: in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, "May I?"
LINE 58: and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the
LINE 59: same fat five fingers.
LINE 60: "Hah!" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. "And air you
LINE 61: a-going to Joseph?"
LINE 62: "In heaven's name," said I, firing in spite of myself, "what does it
LINE 63: matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone."
LINE 64: It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook
LINE 65: the opportunity he wanted.
LINE 66: "Yes, young man," said he, releasing the handle of the article in
LINE 67: question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the
LINE 68: behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, "I _will_ leave that
LINE 69: teapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I
LINE 70: forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to
LINE 71: wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of
LINE 72: prodigygality, to be stimilated by the 'olesome nourishment of your
LINE 73: forefathers. And yet," said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and
LINE 74: waiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, "this is him as I ever
LINE 75: sported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I
LINE 76: tell you this is him!"
LINE 77: A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be
LINE 78: particularly affected.
LINE 79: "This is him," said Pumblechook, "as I have rode in my shay-cart. This
LINE 80: is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister
LINE 81: of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M'ria from
LINE 82: her own mother, let him deny it if he can!"
LINE 83: The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave
LINE 84: the case a black look.
LINE 85: "Young man," said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old
LINE 86: fashion, "you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask
LINE 87: me, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to
LINE 88: Joseph."
LINE 89: The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.
LINE 90: "Now," said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of
LINE 91: saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
LINE 92: conclusive, "I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of
LINE 93: the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is
LINE 94: William, which his father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive
LINE 95: myself."
LINE 96: "You do not, sir," said William.
LINE 97: "In their presence," pursued Pumblechook, "I will tell you, young man,
LINE 98: what to say to Joseph. Says you, "Joseph, I have this day seen my
LINE 99: earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun's. I will name no
LINE 100: names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have
LINE 101: seen that man."
LINE 102: "I swear I don't see him here," said I.
LINE 103: "Say that likewise," retorted Pumblechook. "Say you said that, and even
LINE 104: Joseph will probably betray surprise."
LINE 105: "There you quite mistake him," said I. "I know better."
LINE 106: "Says you," Pumblechook went on, "'Joseph, I have seen that man, and
LINE 107: that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your
LINE 108: character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and
LINE 109: ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of
LINE 110: gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,' says you," here Pumblechook shook his head
LINE 111: and hand at me, "'he knows my total deficiency of common human
LINE 112: gratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,
LINE 113: Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.'"
LINE 114: Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face
LINE 115: to talk thus to mine.
LINE 116: "Says you, 'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now
LINE 117: repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of
LINE 118: Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it
LINE 119: plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to
LINE 120: his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's_. But that man said he
LINE 121: did not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to
LINE 122: do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would
LINE 123: do it again.'"
LINE 124: "It's pity," said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted
LINE 125: breakfast, "that the man did not say what he had done and would do
LINE 126: again."
LINE 127: "Squires of the Boar!" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,
LINE 128: "and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town
LINE 129: or down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do
LINE 130: it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again."
LINE 131: With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,
LINE 132: and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by
LINE 133: the virtues of that same indefinite "it." I was not long after him in
LINE 134: leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him
LINE 135: holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a
LINE 136: select group, who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as I
LINE 137: passed on the opposite side of the way.
LINE 138: But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose
LINE 139: great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,
LINE 140: contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for
LINE 141: my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew
LINE 142: nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness
LINE 143: further and further behind.
LINE 144: The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were
LINE 145: soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more
LINE 146: beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many
LINE 147: pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the
LINE 148: change for the better that would come over my character when I had a
LINE 149: guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I
LINE 150: had proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for
LINE 151: my heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,
LINE 152: that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,
LINE 153: and whose wanderings had lasted many years.
LINE 154: The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the
LINE 155: little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness'
LINE 156: sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a
LINE 157: holiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. Some
LINE 158: hopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,
LINE 159: before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.
LINE 160: But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it
LINE 161: under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer.
LINE 162: Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I
LINE 163: heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,
LINE 164: and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and
LINE 165: their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the
LINE 166: clink of Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.
LINE 167: Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I
LINE 168: saw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no
LINE 169: glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and
LINE 170: still.
LINE 171: But the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in
LINE 172: use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the
LINE 173: window was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning
LINE 174: to peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in
LINE 175: arm.
LINE 176: At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but
LINE 177: in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she
LINE 178: wept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,
LINE 179: because I looked so worn and white.
LINE 180: "But dear Biddy, how smart you are!"
LINE 181: "Yes, dear Pip."
LINE 182: "And Joe, how smart _you_ are!"
LINE 183: "Yes, dear old Pip, old chap."
LINE 184: I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then—
LINE 185: "It's my wedding-day!" cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, "and I am
LINE 186: married to Joe!"
LINE 187: They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the
LINE 188: old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe's
LINE 189: restoring touch was on my shoulder. "Which he warn't strong enough, my
LINE 190: dear, fur to be surprised," said Joe. And Biddy said, "I ought to have
LINE 191: thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy." They were both so
LINE 192: overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to
LINE 193: them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their
LINE 194: day complete!
LINE 195: My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never
LINE 196: breathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me
LINE 197: in my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been
LINE 198: his knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!
LINE 199: "Dear Biddy," said I, "you have the best husband in the whole world,
LINE 200: and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have—But no, you
LINE 201: couldn't love him better than you do."
LINE 202: "No, I couldn't indeed," said Biddy.
LINE 203: "And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will
LINE 204: make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble
LINE 205: Joe!"
LINE 206: Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before
LINE 207: his eyes.
LINE 208: "And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in
LINE 209: charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you
LINE 210: have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I
LINE 211: am going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I
LINE 212: shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have
LINE 213: kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe
LINE 214: and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I
LINE 215: could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if
LINE 216: I could!"
LINE 217: They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no
LINE 218: more.
LINE 219: "But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,
LINE 220: and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter
LINE 221: night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for
LINE 222: ever. Don't tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don't tell him, Biddy,
LINE 223: that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you
LINE 224: both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,
LINE 225: I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I
LINE 226: did."
LINE 227: "I ain't a-going," said Joe, from behind his sleeve, "to tell him
LINE 228: nothink o' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't."
LINE 229: "And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind
LINE 230: hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you
LINE 231: say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and
LINE 232: then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better
LINE 233: of me, in the time to come!"
LINE 234: "O dear old Pip, old chap," said Joe. "God knows as I forgive you, if I
LINE 235: have anythink to forgive!"
LINE 236: "Amen! And God knows I do!" echoed Biddy.
LINE 237: "Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few
LINE 238: minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go
LINE 239: with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say
LINE 240: good-bye!"
LINE 241: I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition
LINE 242: with my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I
LINE 243: went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and
LINE 244: within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four
LINE 245: months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across
LINE 246: the parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under
LINE 247: old Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to
LINE 248: marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until
LINE 249: he brought her back.
LINE 250: Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived
LINE 251: happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my
LINE 252: debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It
LINE 253: was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to
LINE 254: Herbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership
LINE 255: had been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he
LINE 256: told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow
LINE 257: and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not
LINE 258: leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we
LINE 259: made mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had
LINE 260: a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so
LINE 261: much to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often
LINE 262: wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I
LINE 263: was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude
LINE 264: had never been in him at all, but had been in me.
