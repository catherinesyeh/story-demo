LINE 1: Block, the businessman--Dismissing the lawyer
LINE 2: K. had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the
LINE 3: lawyer. It was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was
LINE 4: the right decision, but this was outweighed by his belief in its
LINE 5: necessity. This decision, on the day he intended to go to see the
LINE 6: lawyer, took a lot of the strength he needed for his work, he worked
LINE 7: exceptionally slowly, he had to remain in his office a long time, and
LINE 8: it was already past ten o'clock when he finally stood in front of the
LINE 9: lawyer's front door. Even before he rang he considered whether it might
LINE 10: not be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone, a
LINE 11: personal conversation would certainly be very difficult. Nonetheless,
LINE 12: K. did not actually want to do without it, if he gave notice by any
LINE 13: other means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated
LINE 14: words, and unless Leni could discover anything K. would never learn how
LINE 15: the lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences might be,
LINE 16: in the lawyer's not unimportant opinion. But sitting in front of him
LINE 17: and taken by surprise by his dismissal, K. would be able easily to
LINE 18: infer everything he wanted from the lawyer's face and behaviour, even if
LINE 19: he could not be induced to say very much. It was not even out of the
LINE 20: question that K. might, after all, be persuaded that it would be best
LINE 21: to leave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal.
LINE 22: As usual, there was at first no response to K.'s ring at the door.
LINE 23: "Leni could be a bit quicker," thought K. But he could at least be glad
LINE 24: there was nobody else interfering as usually happened, be it the man in
LINE 25: his nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him. As K. pressed on
LINE 26: the button for the second time he looked back at the other door, but
LINE 27: this time it, too, remained closed. At last, two eyes appeared at the
LINE 28: spy-hatch in the lawyer's door, although they weren't Leni's eyes.
LINE 29: Someone unlocked the door, but kept himself pressed against it as he
LINE 30: called back inside, "It's him!", and only then did he open the door
LINE 31: properly. K. pushed against the door, as behind him he could already
LINE 32: hear the key being hurriedly turned in the lock of the door to the
LINE 33: other flat. When the door in front of him finally opened, he stormed
LINE 34: straight into the hallway. Through the corridor which led between the
LINE 35: rooms he saw Leni, to whom the warning cry of the door opener had been
LINE 36: directed, still running away in her nightshirt. He looked at her for a
LINE 37: moment and then looked round at the person who had opened the door. It
LINE 38: was a small, wizened man with a full beard, he held a candle in his
LINE 39: hand. "Do you work here?" asked K. "No," answered the man, "I don't
LINE 40: belong here at all, the lawyer is only representing me, I'm here on
LINE 41: legal business." "Without your coat?" asked K., indicating the man's
LINE 42: deficiency of dress with a gesture of his hand. "Oh, do forgive me!"
LINE 43: said the man, and he looked at himself in the light of the candle he was
LINE 44: holding as if he had not known about his appearance until then. "Is Leni
LINE 45: your lover?" asked K. curtly. He had set his legs slightly apart, his
LINE 46: hands, in which he held his hat, were behind his back. Merely by being
LINE 47: in possession of a thick overcoat he felt his advantage over this thin
LINE 48: little man. "Oh God," he said and, shocked, raised one hand in front of
LINE 49: his face as if in defence, "no, no, what can you be thinking?" "You look
LINE 50: honest enough," said K. with a smile, "but come along anyway." K.
LINE 51: indicated with his hat which way the man was to go and let him go ahead
LINE 52: of him. "What is your name then?" asked K. on the way. "Block. I'm a
LINE 53: businessman," said the small man, twisting himself round as he thus
LINE 54: introduced himself, although K. did not allow him to stop moving. "Is
LINE 55: that your real name?" asked K. "Of course it is," was the man's reply,
LINE 56: "why do you doubt it?" "I thought you might have some reason to keep
LINE 57: your name secret," said K. He felt himself as much at liberty as is
LINE 58: normally only felt in foreign parts when speaking with people of lower
LINE 59: standing, keeping everything about himself to himself, speaking only
LINE 60: casually about the interests of the other, able to raise him to a level
LINE 61: above one's own, but also able, at will, to let him drop again. K.
LINE 62: stopped at the door of the lawyer's office, opened it and, to the
LINE 63: businessman who had obediently gone ahead, called, "Not so fast! Bring
LINE 64: some light here!" K. thought Leni might have hidden in here, he let the
LINE 65: businessman search in every corner, but the room was empty. In front of
LINE 66: the picture of the judge K. took hold of the businessman's braces to
LINE 67: stop him moving on. "Do you know him?" he asked, pointing upwards with
LINE 68: his finger. The businessman lifted the candle, blinked as he looked up
LINE 69: and said, "It's a judge." "An important judge?" asked K., and stood to
LINE 70: the side and in front of the businessman so that he could observe what
LINE 71: impression the picture had on him. The businessman was looking up in
LINE 72: admiration. "He's an important judge." "You don't have much insight,"
LINE 73: said K. "He is the lowest of the lowest examining judges." "I remember
LINE 74: now," said the businessman as he lowered the candle, "that's what I've
LINE 75: already been told." "Well of course you have," called out K., "I'd
LINE 76: forgotten about it, of course you would already have been told." "But
LINE 77: why, why?" asked the businessman as he moved forwards towards the door,
LINE 78: propelled by the hands of K. Outside in the corridor K. said, "You know
LINE 79: where Leni's hidden, do you?" "Hidden?" said the businessman, "No, but
LINE 80: she might be in the kitchen cooking soup for the lawyer." "Why didn't
LINE 81: you say that immediately?" asked K. "I was going to take you there, but
LINE 82: you called me back again," answered the businessman, as if confused by
LINE 83: the contradictory commands. "You think you're very clever, don't you,"
LINE 84: said K., "now take me there!" K. had never been in the kitchen, it was
LINE 85: surprisingly big and very well equipped. The stove alone was three
LINE 86: times bigger than normal stoves, but it was not possible to see any
LINE 87: detail beyond this as the kitchen was at the time illuminated by no more
LINE 88: than a small lamp hanging by the entrance. At the stove stood Leni, in a
LINE 89: white apron as always, breaking eggs into a pot standing on a spirit
LINE 90: lamp. "Good evening, Josef," she said with a glance sideways. "Good
LINE 91: evening," said K., pointing with one hand to a chair in a corner which
LINE 92: the businessman was to sit on, and he did indeed sit down on it. K.
LINE 93: however went very close behind Leni's back, leant over her shoulder and
LINE 94: asked, "Who is this man?" Leni put one hand around K. as she stirred the
LINE 95: soup with the other, she drew him forward toward herself and said, "He's
LINE 96: a pitiful character, a poor businessman by the name of Block. Just look
LINE 97: at him." The two of them looked back over their shoulders. The
LINE 98: businessman was sitting on the chair that K. had directed him to, he
LINE 99: had extinguished the candle whose light was no longer needed and pressed
LINE 100: on the wick with his fingers to stop the smoke. "You were in your
LINE 101: nightshirt," said K., putting his hand on her head and turning it back
LINE 102: towards the stove. She was silent. "Is he your lover?" asked K. She was
LINE 103: about to take hold of the pot of soup, but K. took both her hands and
LINE 104: said, "Answer me!" She said, "Come into the office, I'll explain
LINE 105: everything to you." "No," said K., "I want you to explain it here." She
LINE 106: put her arms around him and wanted to kiss him. K., though, pushed her
LINE 107: away and said, "I don't want you to kiss me now." "Josef," said Leni,
LINE 108: looking at K. imploringly but frankly in the eyes, "you're not going to
LINE 109: be jealous of Mr. Block now, are you. Rudi," she then said, turning to
LINE 110: the businessman, "help me out will you, I'm being suspected of
LINE 111: something, you can see that, leave the candle alone." It had looked as
LINE 112: though Mr. Block had not been paying attention but he had been
LINE 113: following closely. "I don't even know why you might be jealous," he
LINE 114: said ingenuously. "Nor do I, actually," said K., looking at the
LINE 115: businessman with a smile. Leni laughed out loud and while K. was not
LINE 116: paying attention took the opportunity of embracing him and whispering,
LINE 117: "Leave him alone, now, you can see what sort of person he is. I've been
LINE 118: helping him a little bit because he's an important client of the
LINE 119: lawyer's, and no other reason. And what about you? Do you want to speak
LINE 120: to the lawyer at this time of day? He's very unwell today, but if you
LINE 121: want I'll tell him you're here. But you can certainly spend the night
LINE 122: with me. It's so long since you were last here, even the lawyer has been
LINE 123: asking about you. Don't neglect your case! And I've got some things to
LINE 124: tell you that I've learned about. But now, before anything else, take
LINE 125: your coat off!" She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his
LINE 126: head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran
LINE 127: back and saw to the soup. "Do you want me to tell him you're here
LINE 128: straight away or take him his soup first?" "Tell him I'm here first,"
LINE 129: said K. He was in a bad mood, he had originally intended a detailed
LINE 130: discussion of his business with Leni, especially the question of his
LINE 131: giving the lawyer notice, but now he no longer wanted to because of the
LINE 132: presence of the businessman. Now he considered his affair too important
LINE 133: to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some
LINE 134: of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already
LINE 135: on her way to the lawyer. "Bring him his soup first," he said, "I want
LINE 136: him to get his strength up for the discussion with me, he'll need it."
LINE 137: "You're a client of the lawyer's too, aren't you," said the businessman
LINE 138: quietly from his corner as if he were trying to find this out. It was
LINE 139: not, however, taken well. "What business is that of yours?" said K., and
LINE 140: Leni said, "Will you be quiet.--I'll take him his soup first then, shall
LINE 141: I?" And she poured the soup into a dish. "The only worry then is that
LINE 142: he might go to sleep soon after he's eaten." "What I've got to say to
LINE 143: him will keep him awake," said K., who still wanted to intimate that he
LINE 144: intended some important negotiations with the lawyer, he wanted Leni to
LINE 145: ask him what it was and only then to ask her advice. But instead, she
LINE 146: just promptly carried out the order he had given her. When she went
LINE 147: over to him with the dish she deliberately brushed against him and
LINE 148: whispered, "I'll tell him you're here as soon as he's eaten the soup so
LINE 149: that I can get you back as soon as possible." "Just go," said K., "just
LINE 150: go." "Be a bit more friendly," she said and, still holding the dish,
LINE 151: turned completely round once more in the doorway.
LINE 152: K. watched her as she went; the decision had finally been made that the
LINE 153: lawyer was to be dismissed, it was probably better that he had not been
LINE 154: able to discuss the matter any more with Leni beforehand; she hardly
LINE 155: understood the complexity of the matter, she would certainly have
LINE 156: advised him against it and perhaps would even have prevented him from
LINE 157: dismissing the lawyer this time, he would have remained in doubt and
LINE 158: unease and eventually have carried out his decision after a while
LINE 159: anyway as this decision was something he could not avoid. The sooner it
LINE 160: was carried out the more harm would be avoided. And moreover, perhaps
LINE 161: the businessman had something to say on the matter.
LINE 162: K. turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to
LINE 163: stand up. "Stay where you are," said K. and pulled up a chair beside
LINE 164: him. "Have you been a client of the lawyer's for a long time?" asked K.
LINE 165: "Yes," said the businessman, "a very long time." "How many years has he
LINE 166: been representing you so far, then?" asked K. "I don't know how you
LINE 167: mean," said the businessman, "he's been my business lawyer--I buy and
LINE 168: sell cereals--he's been my business lawyer since I took the business
LINE 169: over, and that's about twenty years now, but perhaps you mean my own
LINE 170: trial and he's been representing me in that since it started, and
LINE 171: that's been more than five years. Yes, well over five years," he then
LINE 172: added, pulling out an old briefcase, "I've got everything written down;
LINE 173: I can tell you the exact dates if you like. It's so hard to remember
LINE 174: everything. Probably, my trial's been going on much longer than that,
LINE 175: it started soon after the death of my wife, and that's been more than
LINE 176: five and a half years now." K. moved in closer to him. "So the lawyer
LINE 177: takes on ordinary legal business, does he?" he asked. This combination
LINE 178: of criminal and commercial business seemed surprisingly reassuring for
LINE 179: K. "Oh yes," said the businessman, and then he whispered, "They even
LINE 180: say he's more efficient in jurisprudence than he is in other matters."
LINE 181: But then he seemed to regret saying this, and he laid a hand on K.'s
LINE 182: shoulder and said, "Please don't betray me to him, will you." K. patted
LINE 183: his thigh to reassure him and said, "No, I don't betray people." "He
LINE 184: can be so vindictive, you see," said the businessman. "I'm sure he won't
LINE 185: do anything against such a faithful client as you," said K. "Oh, he
LINE 186: might do," said the businessman, "when he gets cross it doesn't matter
LINE 187: who it is, and anyway, I'm not really faithful to him." "How's that
LINE 188: then?" asked K. "I'm not sure I should tell you about it," said the
LINE 189: businessman hesitantly. "I think it'll be alright," said K. "Well then,"
LINE 190: said the businessman, "I'll tell you about some of it, but you'll have
LINE 191: to tell me a secret too, then we can support each other with the
LINE 192: lawyer." "You are very careful," said K., "but I'll tell you a secret
LINE 193: that will set your mind completely at ease. Now tell me, in what way
LINE 194: have you been unfaithful to the lawyer?" "I've ..." said the businessman
LINE 195: hesitantly, and in a tone as if he were confessing something
LINE 196: dishonourable, "I've taken on other lawyers besides him." "That's not so
LINE 197: serious," said K., a little disappointed. "It is, here," said the
LINE 198: businessman, who had had some difficulty breathing since making his
LINE 199: confession but who now, after hearing K.'s comment, began to feel more
LINE 200: trust for him. "That's not allowed. And it's allowed least of all to
LINE 201: take on petty lawyers when you've already got a proper one. And that's
LINE 202: just what I have done, besides him I've got five petty lawyers." "Five!"
LINE 203: exclaimed K., astonished at this number, "Five lawyers besides this
LINE 204: one?" The businessman nodded. "I'm even negotiating with a sixth one."
LINE 205: "But why do you need so many lawyers?" asked K. "I need all of them,"
LINE 206: said the businessman. "Would you mind explaining that to me?" asked K.
LINE 207: "I'd be glad to," said the businessman. "Most of all, I don't want to
LINE 208: lose my case, well that's obvious. So that means I mustn't neglect
LINE 209: anything that might be of use to me; even if there's very little hope of
LINE 210: a particular thing being of any use I can't just throw it away. So
LINE 211: everything I have I've put to use in my case. I've taken all the money
LINE 212: out of my business, for example, the offices for my business used to
LINE 213: occupy nearly a whole floor, but now all I need is a little room at the
LINE 214: back where I work with one apprentice. It wasn't just using up the money
LINE 215: that caused the difficulty, of course, it was much more to do with me
LINE 216: not working at the business as much as I used to. If you want to do
LINE 217: something about your trial you don't have much time for anything else."
LINE 218: "So you're also working at the court yourself?" asked K. "That's just
LINE 219: what I want to learn more about." "I can't tell you very much about
LINE 220: that," said the businessman, "at first I tried to do that too but I soon
LINE 221: had to give it up again. It wears you out too much, and it's really not
LINE 222: much use. And it turned out to be quite impossible to work there
LINE 223: yourself and to negotiate, at least for me it was. It's a heavy strain
LINE 224: there just sitting and waiting. You know yourself what the air is like
LINE 225: in those offices." "How do you know I've been there, then?" asked K. "I
LINE 226: was in the waiting room myself when you went through." "What a
LINE 227: coincidence that is!" exclaimed K., totally engrossed and forgetting how
LINE 228: ridiculous the businessman had seemed to him earlier. "So you saw me!
LINE 229: You were in the waiting room when I went through. Yes, I did go through
LINE 230: it one time." "It isn't such a big coincidence," said the businessman,
LINE 231: "I'm there nearly every day." "I expect I'll have to go there quite
LINE 232: often myself now," said K., "although I can hardly expect to be shown
LINE 233: the same respect as I was then. They all stood up for me. They must have
LINE 234: thought I was a judge." "No," said the businessman, "we were greeting
LINE 235: the servant of the court. We knew you were a defendant. That sort of
LINE 236: news spreads very quickly." "So you already knew about that," said K.,
LINE 237: "the way I behaved must have seemed very arrogant to you. Did you
LINE 238: criticise me for it afterwards?" "No," said the businessman, "quite the
LINE 239: opposite. That was just stupidity." "What do you mean, 'stupidity'?"
LINE 240: asked K. "Why are you asking about it?" said the businessman in some
LINE 241: irritation. "You still don't seem to know the people there and you might
LINE 242: take it wrong. Don't forget in proceedings like this there are always
LINE 243: lots of different things coming up to talk about, things that you just
LINE 244: can't understand with reason alone, you just get too tired and
LINE 245: distracted for most things and so, instead, people rely on superstition.
LINE 246: I'm talking about the others, but I'm no better myself. One of these
LINE 247: superstitions, for example, is that you can learn a lot about the
LINE 248: outcome of a defendant's case by looking at his face, especially the
LINE 249: shape of his lips. There are lots who believe that, and they said they
LINE 250: could see from the shape of your lips that you'd definitely be found
LINE 251: guilty very soon. I repeat that all this is just a ridiculous
LINE 252: superstition, and in most cases it's completely disproved by the facts,
LINE 253: but when you live in that society it's hard to hold yourself back from
LINE 254: beliefs like that. Just think how much effect that superstition can
LINE 255: have. You spoke to one of them there, didn't you? He was hardly able to
LINE 256: give you an answer. There are lots of things there that can make you
LINE 257: confused, of course, but one of them, for him, was the appearance of
LINE 258: your lips. He told us all later he thought he could see something in
LINE 259: your lips that meant he'd be convicted himself." "On my lips?" asked K.,
LINE 260: pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. "I can see nothing
LINE 261: special about my lips. Can you?" "Nor can I," said the businessman,
LINE 262: "nothing at all." "These people are so superstitious!" exclaimed K.
LINE 263: "Isn't that what I just told you?" asked the businessman. "Do you then
LINE 264: have that much contact with each other, exchanging each other's
LINE 265: opinions?" said K. "I've kept myself completely apart so far." "They
LINE 266: don't normally have much contact with each other," said the businessman,
LINE 267: "that would be impossible, there are so many of them. And they don't
LINE 268: have much in common either. If a group of them ever thinks they have
LINE 269: found something in common it soon turns out they were mistaken. There's
LINE 270: nothing you can do as a group where the court's concerned. Each case is
LINE 271: examined separately, the court is very painstaking. So there's nothing
LINE 272: to be achieved by forming into a group, only sometimes an individual
LINE 273: will achieve something in secret; and it's only when that's been done
LINE 274: the others learn about it; nobody knows how it was done. So there's no
LINE 275: sense of togetherness, you meet people now and then in the waiting
LINE 276: rooms, but we don't talk much there. The superstitious beliefs were
LINE 277: established a long time ago and they spread all by themselves." "I saw
LINE 278: those gentlemen in the waiting room," said K., "it seemed so pointless
LINE 279: for them to be waiting in that way." "Waiting is not pointless," said
LINE 280: the businessman, "it's only pointless if you try and interfere yourself.
LINE 281: I told you just now I've got five lawyers besides this one. You might
LINE 282: think--I thought it myself at first--you might think I could leave the
LINE 283: whole thing entirely up to them now. That would be entirely wrong. I can
LINE 284: leave it up to them less than when I had just the one. Maybe you don't
LINE 285: understand that, do you?" "No," said K., and to slow the businessman
LINE 286: down, who had been speaking too fast, he laid his hand on the
LINE 287: businessman's to reassure him, "but I'd like just to ask you to speak a
LINE 288: little more slowly, these are many very important things for me, and I
LINE 289: can't follow exactly what you're saying." "You're quite right to remind
LINE 290: me of that," said the businessman, "you're new to all this, a junior.
LINE 291: Your trial is six months old, isn't it. Yes, I've heard about it. Such a
LINE 292: new case! But I've already thought all these things through countless
LINE 293: times, to me they're the most obvious things in the world." "You must be
LINE 294: glad your trial has already progressed so far, are you?" asked K., he
LINE 295: did not wish to ask directly how the businessman's affairs stood, but
LINE 296: received no clear answer anyway. "Yes, I've been working at my trial for
LINE 297: five years now," said the businessman as his head sank, "that's no small
LINE 298: achievement." Then he was silent for a while. K. listened to hear
LINE 299: whether Leni was on her way back. On the one hand he did not want her to
LINE 300: come back too soon as he still had many questions to ask and did not
LINE 301: want her to find him in this intimate discussion with the businessman,
LINE 302: but on the other hand it irritated him that she stayed so long with the
LINE 303: lawyer when K. was there, much longer than she needed to give him his
LINE 304: soup. "I still remember it exactly," the businessman began again, and K.
LINE 305: immediately gave him his full attention, "when my case was as old as
LINE 306: yours is now. I only had this one lawyer at that time but I wasn't very
LINE 307: satisfied with him." Now I'll find out everything, thought K., nodding
LINE 308: vigorously as if he could thereby encourage the businessman to say
LINE 309: everything worth knowing. "My case," the businessman continued, "didn't
LINE 310: move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to
LINE 311: every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to
LINE 312: the court--which I later found was entirely unnecessary--I ran back and
LINE 313: forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court
LINE 314: too...." "Various documents?" asked K. "Yes, that's right," said the
LINE 315: businessman. "That's very important for me," said K., "in my case he's
LINE 316: still working on the first set of documents. He still hasn't done
LINE 317: anything. I see now that he's been neglecting me quite disgracefully."
LINE 318: "There can be lots of good reasons why the first documents still aren't
LINE 319: ready," said the businessman, "and anyway, it turned out later on that
LINE 320: the ones he submitted for me were entirely worthless. I even read one of
LINE 321: them myself, one of the officials at the court was very helpful. It was
LINE 322: very learned, but it didn't actually say anything. Most of all, there
LINE 323: was lots of Latin, which I can't understand, then pages and pages of
LINE 324: general appeals to the court, then lots of flattery for particular
LINE 325: officials, they weren't named, these officials, but anyone familiar with
LINE 326: the court must have been able to guess who they were, then there was
LINE 327: self-praise by the lawyer where he humiliated himself to the court in a
LINE 328: way that was downright dog-like, and then endless investigations of
LINE 329: cases from the past which were supposed to be similar to mine. Although,
LINE 330: as far as I was able to follow them, these investigations had been
LINE 331: carried out very carefully. Now, I don't mean to criticise the lawyer's
LINE 332: work with all of this, and the document I read was only one of many, but
LINE 333: even so, and this is something I will say, at that time I couldn't see
LINE 334: any progress in my trial at all." "And what sort of progress had you
LINE 335: been hoping for?" asked K. "That's a very sensible question," said the
LINE 336: businessman with a smile, "it's only very rare that you see any progress
LINE 337: in these proceedings at all. But I didn't know that then. I'm a
LINE 338: businessman, much more in those days than now, I wanted to see some
LINE 339: tangible progress, it should have all been moving to some conclusion or
LINE 340: at least should have been moving on in some way according to the rules.
LINE 341: Instead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went
LINE 342: through the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a
LINE 343: church service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at
LINE 344: work several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else
LINE 345: they could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least
LINE 346: now things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when
LINE 347: they contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started
LINE 348: to spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my
LINE 349: relations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but
LINE 350: there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would
LINE 351: take place soon. So I went to the lawyer and complained about it. He
LINE 352: explained it all to me at length, but refused to do anything I asked
LINE 353: for, no-one has any influence on the way the trial proceeds, he said, to
LINE 354: try and insist on it in any of the documents submitted--like I was
LINE 355: asking--was simply unheard of and would do harm to both him and me. I
LINE 356: thought to myself: What this lawyer can't or won't do another lawyer
LINE 357: will. So I looked round for other lawyers. And before you say anything:
LINE 358: none of them asked for a definite date for the main trial and none of
LINE 359: them got one, and anyway, apart from one exception which I'll talk about
LINE 360: in a minute, it really is impossible, that's one thing this lawyer
LINE 361: didn't mislead me about; but besides, I had no reason to regret turning
LINE 362: to other lawyers. Perhaps you've already heard how Dr. Huld talks about
LINE 363: the petty lawyers, he probably made them sound very contemptible to you,
LINE 364: and he's right, they are contemptible. But when he talks about them and
LINE 365: compares them with himself and his colleagues there's a small error
LINE 366: running through what he says, and, just for your interest, I'll tell you
LINE 367: about it. When he talks about the lawyers he mixes with he sets them
LINE 368: apart by calling them the 'great lawyers'. That's wrong, anyone can call
LINE 369: himself 'great' if he wants to, of course, but in this case only the
LINE 370: usage of the court can make that distinction. You see, the court says
LINE 371: that besides the petty lawyers there are also minor lawyers and great
LINE 372: lawyers. This one and his colleagues are only minor lawyers, and the
LINE 373: difference in rank between them and the great lawyers, who I've only
LINE 374: ever heard about and never seen, is incomparably greater than between
LINE 375: the minor lawyers and the despised petty lawyers." "The great lawyers?"
LINE 376: asked K. "Who are they then? How do you contact them?" "You've never
LINE 377: heard about them, then?" said the businessman. "There's hardly anyone
LINE 378: who's been accused who doesn't spend a lot of time dreaming about the
LINE 379: great lawyers once he's heard about them. It's best if you don't let
LINE 380: yourself be misled in that way. I don't know who the great lawyers are,
LINE 381: and there's probably no way of contacting them. I don't know of any case
LINE 382: I can talk about with certainty where they've taken any part. They do
LINE 383: defend a lot of people, but you can't get hold of them by your own
LINE 384: efforts, they only defend those who they want to defend. And I don't
LINE 385: suppose they ever take on cases that haven't already got past the lower
LINE 386: courts. Anyway, it's best not to think about them, as if you do it makes
LINE 387: the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that
LINE 388: they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless, I had that
LINE 389: experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home
LINE 390: in bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the
LINE 391: stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn't be left in peace in bed
LINE 392: for very long either." "So you weren't thinking about the great lawyers
LINE 393: at that time?" asked K. "Not for very long," said the businessman, and
LINE 394: smiled again, "you can't forget about them entirely, I'm afraid,
LINE 395: especially in the night when these thoughts come so easily. But I wanted
LINE 396: immediate results in those days, so I went to the petty lawyers."
LINE 397: "Well look at you two sat huddled together!" called Leni as she came
LINE 398: back with the dish and stood in the doorway. They were indeed sat close
LINE 399: together, if either of them turned his head even slightly it would have
LINE 400: knocked against the other's, the businessman was not only very small
LINE 401: but also sat hunched down, so that K. was also forced to bend down low
LINE 402: if he wanted to hear everything. "Not quite yet!" called out K., to turn
LINE 403: Leni away, his hand, still resting on the businessman's hand, twitching
LINE 404: with impatience. "He wanted me to tell him about my trial," said the
LINE 405: businessman to Leni. "Carry on, then, carry on," she said. She spoke to
LINE 406: the businessman with affection but, at the same time, with
LINE 407: condescension. K. did not like that, he had begun to learn that the man
LINE 408: was of some value after all, he had experience at least, and he was
LINE 409: willing to share it. Leni was probably wrong about him. He watched her
LINE 410: in irritation as Leni now took the candle from the businessman's
LINE 411: hand--which he had been holding on to all this time--wiped his hand
LINE 412: with her apron and then knelt beside him to scratch off some wax that
LINE 413: had dripped from the candle onto his trousers. "You were about to tell
LINE 414: me about the petty lawyers," said K., shoving Leni's hand away with no
LINE 415: further comment. "What's wrong with you today?" asked Leni, tapped him
LINE 416: gently and carried on with what she had been doing. "Yes, the petty
LINE 417: lawyers," said the businessman, putting his hand to his brow as if
LINE 418: thinking hard. K. wanted to help him and said, "You wanted immediate
LINE 419: results and so went to the petty lawyers." "Yes, that's right," said
LINE 420: the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying. "Maybe
LINE 421: he doesn't want to speak about it in front of Leni," thought K.,
LINE 422: suppressing his impatience to hear the rest straight away, and stopped
LINE 423: trying to press him.
LINE 424: "Have you told him I'm here?" he asked Leni. "Course I have," she said,
LINE 425: "he's waiting for you. Leave Block alone now, you can talk to Block
LINE 426: later, he'll still be here." K. still hesitated. "You'll still be
LINE 427: here?" he asked the businessman, wanting to hear the answer from him and
LINE 428: not wanting Leni to speak about the businessman as if he weren't there,
LINE 429: he was full of secret resentment towards Leni today. And once more it
LINE 430: was only Leni who answered. "He often sleeps here." "He sleeps here?"
LINE 431: exclaimed K., he had thought the businessman would just wait there for
LINE 432: him while he quickly settled his business with the lawyer, and then
LINE 433: they would leave together to discuss everything thoroughly and
LINE 434: undisturbed. "Yes," said Leni, "not everyone's like you, Josef, allowed
LINE 435: to see the lawyer at any time you like. Don't even seem surprised that
LINE 436: the lawyer, despite being ill, still receives you at eleven o'clock at
LINE 437: night. You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do for
LINE 438: you. Well, your friends, or at least I do, we like to do things for you.
LINE 439: I don't want or need any more thanks than that you're fond of me." "Fond
LINE 440: of you?" thought K. at first, and only then it occurred to him, "Well,
LINE 441: yes, I am fond of her." Nonetheless, what he said, forgetting all the
LINE 442: rest, was, "He receives me because I am his client. If I needed anyone
LINE 443: else's help I'd have to beg and show gratitude whenever I do anything."
LINE 444: "He's really nasty today, isn't he?" Leni asked the businessman. "Now
LINE 445: it's me who's not here," thought K., and nearly lost his temper with
LINE 446: the businessman when, with the same rudeness as Leni, he said, "The
LINE 447: lawyer also has other reasons to receive him. His case is much more
LINE 448: interesting than mine. And it's only in its early stages too, it
LINE 449: probably hasn't progressed very far so the lawyer still likes to deal
LINE 450: with him. That'll all change later on." "Yeah, yeah," said Leni, looking
LINE 451: at the businessman and laughing. "He doesn't half talk!" she said,
LINE 452: turning to face K. "You can't believe a word he says. He's as talkative
LINE 453: as he is sweet. Maybe that's why the lawyer can't stand him. At least,
LINE 454: he only sees him when he's in the right mood. I've already tried hard to
LINE 455: change that but it's impossible. Just think, there are times when I tell
LINE 456: him Block's here and he doesn't receive him until three days later. And
LINE 457: if Block isn't on the spot when he's called then everything's lost and
LINE 458: it all has to start all over again. That's why I let Block sleep here,
LINE 459: it wouldn't be the first time Dr. Huld has wanted to see him in the
LINE 460: night. So now Block is ready for that. Sometimes, when he knows Block is
LINE 461: still here, he'll even change his mind about letting him in to see him."
LINE 462: K. looked questioningly at the businessman. The latter nodded and,
LINE 463: although he had spoken quite openly with K. earlier, seemed to be
LINE 464: confused with shame as he said, "Yes, later on you become very dependent
LINE 465: on your lawyer." "He's only pretending to mind," said Leni. "He likes to
LINE 466: sleep here really, he's often said so." She went over to a little door
LINE 467: and shoved it open. "Do you want to see his bedroom?" she asked. K.
LINE 468: went over to the low, windowless room and looked in from the doorway.
LINE 469: The room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely, so that to
LINE 470: get into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost. At the head
LINE 471: of the bed there was a niche in the wall where, fastidiously tidy, stood
LINE 472: a candle, a bottle of ink, and a pen with a bundle of papers which were
LINE 473: probably to do with the trial. "You sleep in the maid's room?" asked
LINE 474: K., as he went back to the businessman. "Leni's let me have it,"
LINE 475: answered the businessman, "it has many advantages." K. looked long at
LINE 476: him; his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right;
LINE 477: he had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time, but he
LINE 478: had paid a heavy price for this experience. K. was suddenly unable to
LINE 479: bear the sight of the businessman any longer. "Bring him to bed, then!"
LINE 480: he called out to Leni, who seemed to understand him. For himself, he
LINE 481: wanted to go to the lawyer and, by dismissing him, free himself from not
LINE 482: only the lawyer but also from Leni and the businessman. But before he
LINE 483: had reached the door the businessman spoke to him gently. "Excuse me,
LINE 484: sir," he said, and K. looked round crossly. "You've forgotten your
LINE 485: promise," said the businessman, stretching his hand out to K.
LINE 486: imploringly from where he sat. "You were going to tell me a secret."
LINE 487: "That is true," said K., as he glanced at Leni, who was watching him
LINE 488: carefully, to check on her. "So listen; it's hardly a secret now anyway.
LINE 489: I'm going to see the lawyer now to sack him." "He's sacking him!" yelled
LINE 490: the businessman, and he jumped up from his chair and ran around the
LINE 491: kitchen with his arms in the air. He kept on shouting, "He's sacking his
LINE 492: lawyer!" Leni tried to rush at K. but the businessman got in her way so
LINE 493: that she shoved him away with her fists. Then, still with her hands
LINE 494: balled into fists, she ran after K. who, however, had been given a long
LINE 495: start. He was already inside the lawyer's room by the time Leni caught
LINE 496: up with him. He had almost closed the door behind himself, but Leni held
LINE 497: the door open with her foot, grabbed his arm and tried to pull him back.
LINE 498: But he put such pressure on her wrist that, with a sigh, she was forced
LINE 499: to release him. She did not dare go into the room straight away, and K.
LINE 500: locked the door with the key.
LINE 501: "I've been waiting for you a very long time," said the lawyer from his
LINE 502: bed. He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he
LINE 503: laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K.
LINE 504: sharply through them. Instead of apologising K. said, "I'll be leaving
LINE 505: again soon." As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K. said,
LINE 506: and replied, "I won't let you in this late again next time." "I find
LINE 507: that quite acceptable," said K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically.
LINE 508: "Sit down," he said. "As you wish," said K., drawing a chair up to the
LINE 509: bedside table and sitting down. "It seemed to me that you locked the
LINE 510: door," said the lawyer. "Yes," said K., "it was because of Leni." He
LINE 511: had no intention of letting anyone off lightly. But the lawyer asked
LINE 512: him, "Was she being importunate again?" "Importunate?" asked K. "Yes,"
LINE 513: said the lawyer, laughing as he did so, had a fit of coughing and then,
LINE 514: once it had passed, began to laugh again. "I'm sure you must have
LINE 515: noticed how importunate she can be sometimes," he said, and patted K.'s
LINE 516: hand which K. had rested on the bedside table and which he now snatched
LINE 517: back. "You don't attach much importance to it, then," said the lawyer
LINE 518: when K. was silent, "so much the better. Otherwise I might have needed
LINE 519: to apologise to you. It is a peculiarity of Leni's. I've long since
LINE 520: forgiven her for it, and I wouldn't be talking of it now, if you hadn't
LINE 521: locked the door just now. Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this
LINE 522: peculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way
LINE 523: you're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of
LINE 524: hers consists in this: Leni finds most of the accused attractive. She
LINE 525: attaches herself to each of them, loves each of them, even seems to be
LINE 526: loved by each of them; then she sometimes entertains me by telling me
LINE 527: about them when I allow her to. I am not so astonished by all of this as
LINE 528: you seem to be. If you look at them in the right way the accused really
LINE 529: can be attractive, quite often. But that is a remarkable and to some
LINE 530: extent scientific phenomenon. Being indicted does not cause any clear,
LINE 531: precisely definable change in a person's appearance, of course. But
LINE 532: it's not like with other legal matters, most of them remain in their
LINE 533: usual way of life and, if they have a good lawyer looking after them,
LINE 534: the trial doesn't get in their way. But there are nonetheless those who
LINE 535: have experience in these matters who can look at a crowd, however big,
LINE 536: and tell you which among them is facing a charge. How can they do that,
LINE 537: you will ask? My answer will not please you. It is simply that those who
LINE 538: are facing a charge are the most attractive. It cannot be their guilt
LINE 539: that makes them attractive as not all of them are guilty--at least
LINE 540: that's what I, as a lawyer, have to say--and nor can it be the proper
LINE 541: punishment that has made them attractive as not all of them are
LINE 542: punished, so it can only be that the proceedings levelled against them
LINE 543: take some kind of hold on them. Whatever the reason, some of these
LINE 544: attractive people are indeed very attractive. But all of them are
LINE 545: attractive, even Block, pitiful worm that he is." As the lawyer
LINE 546: finished what he was saying, K. was fully in control of himself, he had
LINE 547: even nodded conspicuously at his last few words in order to confirm to
LINE 548: himself the view he had already formed: that the lawyer was trying to
LINE 549: confuse him, as he always did, by making general and irrelevant
LINE 550: observations, and thus distract him from the main question of what he
LINE 551: was actually doing for K.'s trial. The lawyer must have noticed that K.
LINE 552: was offering him more resistance than before, as he became silent,
LINE 553: giving K. the chance to speak himself, and then, as K. also remained
LINE 554: silent, he asked, "Did you have a particular reason for coming to see
LINE 555: me today?" "Yes," said K., putting his hand up to slightly shade his
LINE 556: eyes from the light of the candle so that he could see the lawyer
LINE 557: better, "I wanted to tell you that I'm withdrawing my representation
LINE 558: from you, with immediate effect." "Do I understand you rightly?" asked
LINE 559: the lawyer as he half raised himself in his bed and supported himself
LINE 560: with one hand on the pillow. "I think you do," said K., sitting stiffly
LINE 561: upright as if waiting in ambush. "Well we can certainly discuss this
LINE 562: plan of yours," said the lawyer after a pause. "It's not a plan any
LINE 563: more," said K. "That may be," said the lawyer, "but we still mustn't
LINE 564: rush anything." He used the word 'we', as if he had no intention of
LINE 565: letting K. go free, and as if, even if he could no longer represent him,
LINE 566: he could still at least continue as his adviser. "Nothing is being
LINE 567: rushed," said K., standing slowly up and going behind his chair,
LINE 568: "everything has been well thought out and probably even for too long.
LINE 569: The decision is final." "Then allow me to say a few words," said the
LINE 570: lawyer, throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of
LINE 571: the bed. His naked, white-haired legs shivered in the cold. He asked K.
LINE 572: to pass him a blanket from the couch. K. passed him the blanket and
LINE 573: said, "You are running the risk of catching cold for no reason." "The
LINE 574: circumstances are important enough," said the lawyer as he wrapped the
LINE 575: bed cover around the top half of his body and then the blanket around
LINE 576: his legs. "Your uncle is my friend and in the course of time I've become
LINE 577: fond of you as well. I admit that quite openly. There's nothing in that
LINE 578: for me to be ashamed of." It was very unwelcome for K. to hear the old
LINE 579: man speak in this touching way, as it forced him to explain himself more
LINE 580: fully, which he would rather have avoided, and he was aware that it also
LINE 581: confused him even though it could never make him reverse his decision.
LINE 582: "Thank you for feeling so friendly toward me," he said, "and I also
LINE 583: realise how deeply involved you've been in my case, as deeply as
LINE 584: possible for yourself and to bring as much advantage as possible to me.
LINE 585: Nonetheless, I have recently come to the conviction that it is not
LINE 586: enough. I would naturally never attempt, considering that you are so
LINE 587: much older and more experienced than I am, to convince you of my
LINE 588: opinion; if I have ever unintentionally done so then I beg your
LINE 589: forgiveness, but, as you have just said yourself, the circumstances are
LINE 590: important enough and it is my belief that my trial needs to be
LINE 591: approached with much more vigour than has so far been the case." "I
LINE 592: see," said the lawyer, "you've become impatient." "I am not impatient,"
LINE 593: said K., with some irritation and he stopped paying so much attention to
LINE 594: his choice of words. "When I first came here with my uncle you probably
LINE 595: noticed I wasn't greatly concerned about my case, and if I wasn't
LINE 596: reminded of it by force, as it were, I would forget about it completely.
LINE 597: But my uncle insisted I should allow you to represent me and I did so as
LINE 598: a favour to him. I could have expected the case to be less of a burden
LINE 599: than it had been, as the point of taking on a lawyer is that he should
LINE 600: take on some of its weight. But what actually happened was the opposite.
LINE 601: Before, the trial was never such a worry for me as it has been since
LINE 602: you've been representing me. When I was by myself I never did anything
LINE 603: about my case, I was hardly aware of it, but then, once there was
LINE 604: someone representing me, everything was set for something to happen, I
LINE 605: was always, without cease, waiting for you to do something, getting more
LINE 606: and more tense, but you did nothing. I did get some information about
LINE 607: the court from you that I probably could not have got anywhere else, but
LINE 608: that can't be enough when the trial, supposedly in secret, is getting
LINE 609: closer and closer to me." K. had pushed the chair away and stood erect,
LINE 610: his hands in the pockets of his frock coat. "After a certain point in
LINE 611: the proceedings," said the lawyer quietly and calmly, "nothing new of
LINE 612: any importance ever happens. So many litigants, at the same stage in
LINE 613: their trials, have stood before me just like you are now and spoken in
LINE 614: the same way." "Then these other litigants," said K., "have all been
LINE 615: right, just as I am. That does not show that I'm not." "I wasn't trying
LINE 616: to show that you were mistaken," said the lawyer, "but I wanted to add
LINE 617: that I expected better judgement from you than from the others,
LINE 618: especially as I've given you more insight into the workings of the court
LINE 619: and my own activities than I normally do. And now I'm forced to accept
LINE 620: that, despite everything, you have too little trust in me. You don't
LINE 621: make it easy for me." How the lawyer was humiliating himself to K.! He
LINE 622: was showing no regard for the dignity of his position, which on this
LINE 623: point, must have been at its most sensitive. And why did he do that? He
LINE 624: did seem to be very busy as a lawyer as well a rich man, neither the
LINE 625: loss of income nor the loss of a client could have been of much
LINE 626: importance to him in themselves. He was moreover unwell and should have
LINE 627: been thinking of passing work on to others. And despite all that he held
LINE 628: on tightly to K. Why? Was it something personal for his uncle's sake, or
LINE 629: did he really see K.'s case as one that was exceptional and hoped to be
LINE 630: able to distinguish himself with it, either for K.'s sake or--and this
LINE 631: possibility could never be excluded--for his friends at the court. It
LINE 632: was not possible to learn anything by looking at him, even though K. was
LINE 633: scrutinizing him quite brazenly. It could almost be supposed he was
LINE 634: deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his
LINE 635: words would have. But he clearly deemed K.'s silence to be favourable
LINE 636: for himself and he continued, "You will have noticed the size of my
LINE 637: office, but that I don't employ any staff to help me. That used to be
LINE 638: quite different, there was a time when several young lawyers were
LINE 639: working for me but now I work alone. This is partly to do with changes
LINE 640: in the way I do business, in that I concentrate nowadays more and more
LINE 641: on matters such as your own case, and partly to do with the ever deeper
LINE 642: understanding that I acquire from these legal matters. I found that I
LINE 643: could never let anyone else deal with this sort of work unless I wanted
LINE 644: to harm both the client and the job I had taken on. But the decision to
LINE 645: do all the work myself had its obvious result: I was forced to turn
LINE 646: almost everyone away who asked me to represent them and could only
LINE 647: accept those I was especially interested in--well there are enough
LINE 648: creatures who leap at every crumb I throw down, and they're not so very
LINE 649: far away. Most importantly, I became ill from over-work. But despite
LINE 650: that I don't regret my decision, quite possibly I should have turned
LINE 651: more cases away than I did, but it did turn out to be entirely necessary
LINE 652: for me to devote myself fully to the cases I did take on, and the
LINE 653: successful results showed that it was worth it. I once read a
LINE 654: description of the difference between representing someone in ordinary
LINE 655: legal matters and in legal matters of this sort, and the writer
LINE 656: expressed it very well. This is what he said: some lawyers lead their
LINE 657: clients on a thread until judgement is passed, but there are others who
LINE 658: immediately lift their clients onto their shoulders and carry them all
LINE 659: the way to the judgement and beyond. That's just how it is. But it was
LINE 660: quite true when I said I never regret all this work. But if, as in your
LINE 661: case, they are so fully misunderstood, well, then I come very close to
LINE 662: regretting it." All this talking did more to make K. impatient than to
LINE 663: persuade him. From the way the lawyer was speaking, K. thought he could
LINE 664: hear what he could expect if he gave in, the delays and excuses would
LINE 665: begin again, reports of how the documents were progressing, how the mood
LINE 666: of the court officials had improved, as well as all the enormous
LINE 667: difficulties--in short all that he had heard so many times before would
LINE 668: be brought out again even more fully, he would try to mislead K. with
LINE 669: hopes that were never specified and to make him suffer with threats that
LINE 670: were never clear. He had to put a stop to that, so he said, "What will
LINE 671: you undertake on my behalf if you continue to represent me?" The lawyer
LINE 672: quietly accepted even this insulting question, and answered, "I should
LINE 673: continue with what I've already been doing for you." "That's just what I
LINE 674: thought," said K., "and now you don't need to say another word." "I will
LINE 675: make one more attempt," said the lawyer as if whatever had been making
LINE 676: K. so annoyed was affecting him too. "You see, I have the impression
LINE 677: that you have not only misjudged the legal assistance I have given you
LINE 678: but also that that misjudgement has led you to behave in this way, you
LINE 679: seem, although you are the accused, to have been treated too well or, to
LINE 680: put it a better way, handled with neglect, with apparent neglect. Even
LINE 681: that has its reason; it is often better to be in chains than to be free.
LINE 682: But I would like to show you how other defendants are treated, perhaps
LINE 683: you will succeed in learning something from it. What I will do is I will
LINE 684: call Block in, unlock the door and sit down here beside the bedside
LINE 685: table." "Be glad to," said K., and did as the lawyer suggested; he was
LINE 686: always ready to learn something new. But to make sure of himself for any
LINE 687: event he added, "but you do realise that you are no longer to be my
LINE 688: lawyer, don't you?" "Yes," said the lawyer. "But you can still change
LINE 689: your mind today if you want to." He lay back down in the bed, pulled the
LINE 690: quilt up to his chin and turned to face the wall. Then he rang.
LINE 691: Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so. She looked hurriedly at
LINE 692: K. and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened; she seemed to
LINE 693: be reassured by the sight of K. sitting calmly at the lawyer's bed. She
LINE 694: smiled and nodded to K., K. looked blankly back at her. "Fetch Block,"
LINE 695: said the lawyer. But instead of going to fetch him, Leni just went to
LINE 696: the door and called out, "Block! To the lawyer!" Then, probably because
LINE 697: the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and was paying no attention,
LINE 698: she slipped in behind K.'s chair. From then on, she bothered him by
LINE 699: leaning forward over the back of the chair or, albeit very tenderly and
LINE 700: carefully, she would run her hands through his hair and over his
LINE 701: cheeks. K. eventually tried to stop her by taking hold of one hand, and
LINE 702: after some resistance Leni let him keep hold of it. Block came as soon
LINE 703: as he was called, but he remained standing in the doorway and seemed to
LINE 704: be wondering whether he should enter or not. He raised his eyebrows and
LINE 705: lowered his head as if listening to find out whether the order to
LINE 706: attend the lawyer would be repeated. K. could have encouraged him to
LINE 707: enter, but he had decided to make a final break not only with the
LINE 708: lawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himself motionless.
LINE 709: Leni was also silent. Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing
LINE 710: him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his
LINE 711: hands were clenched behind his back. He left the door open in case he
LINE 712: needed to go back again. K. did not even glance at him, he looked
LINE 713: instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen
LINE 714: as he had squeezed up very close to the wall. Then his voice was heard:
LINE 715: "Block here?" he asked. Block had already crept some way into the room
LINE 716: but this question seemed to give him first a shove in the breast and
LINE 717: then another in the back, he seemed about to fall but remained
LINE 718: standing, deeply bowed, and said, "At your service, sir." "What do you
LINE 719: want?" asked the lawyer, "you've come at a bad time." "Wasn't I
LINE 720: summoned?" asked Block, more to himself than the lawyer. He held his
LINE 721: hands in front of himself as protection and would have been ready to run
LINE 722: away any moment. "You were summoned," said the lawyer, "but you have
LINE 723: still come at a bad time." Then, after a pause he added, "You always
LINE 724: come at a bad time." When the lawyer started speaking Block had stopped
LINE 725: looking at the bed but stared rather into one of the corners, just
LINE 726: listening, as if the light from the speaker were brighter than Block
LINE 727: could bear to look at. But it was also difficult for him to listen, as
LINE 728: the lawyer was speaking into the wall and speaking quickly and quietly.
LINE 729: "Would you like me to go away again, sir?" asked Block. "Well you're
LINE 730: here now," said the lawyer. "Stay!" It was as if the lawyer had not done
LINE 731: as Block had wanted but instead threatened him with a stick, as now
LINE 732: Block really began to shake. "I went to see," said the lawyer, "the
LINE 733: third judge yesterday, a friend of mine, and slowly brought the
LINE 734: conversation round to the subject of you. Do you want to know what he
LINE 735: said?" "Oh, yes please," said Block. The lawyer did not answer
LINE 736: immediately, so Block repeated his request and lowered his head as if
LINE 737: about to kneel down. But then K. spoke to him: "What do you think you're
LINE 738: doing?" he shouted. Leni had wanted to stop him from calling out and so
LINE 739: he took hold of her other hand. It was not love that made him squeeze it
LINE 740: and hold on to it so tightly, she sighed frequently and tried to
LINE 741: disengage her hands from him. But Block was punished for K.'s outburst,
LINE 742: as the lawyer asked him, "Who is your lawyer?" "You are, sir," said
LINE 743: Block. "And who besides me?" the lawyer asked. "No-one besides you,
LINE 744: sir," said Block. "And let there be no-one besides me," said the lawyer.
LINE 745: Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his
LINE 746: head violently. If these actions had been translated into words they
LINE 747: would have been coarse insults. K. had been friendly and willing to
LINE 748: discuss his own case with someone like this! "I won't disturb you any
LINE 749: more," said K., leaning back in his chair. "You can kneel down or creep
LINE 750: on all fours, whatever you like. I won't bother with you any more." But
LINE 751: Block still had some sense of pride, at least where K. was concerned,
LINE 752: and he went towards him waving his fists, shouting as loudly as he dared
LINE 753: while the lawyer was there. "You shouldn't speak to me like that, that's
LINE 754: not allowed. Why are you insulting me? Especially here in front of the
LINE 755: lawyer, where both of us, you and me, we're only tolerated because of
LINE 756: his charity. You're not a better person than me, you've been accused of
LINE 757: something too, you're facing a charge too. If, in spite of that, you're
LINE 758: still a gentleman then I'm just as much a gentleman as you are, if not
LINE 759: even more so. And I want to be spoken to as a gentleman, especially by
LINE 760: you. If you think being allowed to sit there and quietly listen while I
LINE 761: creep on all fours as you put it makes you something better than me,
LINE 762: then there's an old legal saying you ought to bear in mind: If you're
LINE 763: under suspicion it's better to be moving than still, as if you're still
LINE 764: you can be in the pan of the scales without knowing it and be weighed
LINE 765: along with your sins." K. said nothing. He merely looked in amazement at
LINE 766: this distracted being, his eyes completely still. He had gone through
LINE 767: such changes in just the last few hours! Was it the trial that was
LINE 768: throwing him from side to side in this way and stopped him knowing who
LINE 769: was friend and who was foe? Could he not see the lawyer was deliberately
LINE 770: humiliating him and had no other purpose today than to show off his
LINE 771: power to K., and perhaps even thereby subjugate K.? But if Block was
LINE 772: incapable of seeing that, or if he so feared the lawyer that no such
LINE 773: insight would even be of any use to him, how was it that he was either
LINE 774: so sly or so bold as to lie to the lawyer and conceal from him the fact
LINE 775: that he had other lawyers working on his behalf? And how did he dare to
LINE 776: attack K., who could betray his secret any time he liked? But he dared
LINE 777: even more than this, he went to the lawyer's bed and began there to make
LINE 778: complaints about K. "Dr. Huld, sir," he said, "did you hear the way this
LINE 779: man spoke to me? You can count the length of his trial in hours, and he
LINE 780: wants to tell me what to do when I've been involved in a legal case for
LINE 781: five years. He even insults me. He doesn't know anything, but he insults
LINE 782: me, when I, as far as my weak ability allows, when I've made a close
LINE 783: study of how to behave with the court, what we ought to do and what the
LINE 784: court practices are." "Don't let anyone bother you," said the lawyer,
LINE 785: "and do what seems to you to be right." "I will," said Block, as if
LINE 786: speaking to himself to give himself courage, and with a quick glance to
LINE 787: the side he knelt down close beside the bed. "I'm kneeling now, Dr.
LINE 788: Huld, sir," he said. But the lawyer remained silent. With one hand,
LINE 789: Block carefully stroked the bed cover. In the silence while he did so,
LINE 790: Leni, as she freed herself from K.'s hands, said, "You're hurting me.
LINE 791: Let go of me. I'm going over to Block." She went over to him and sat on
LINE 792: the edge of the bed. Block was very pleased at this and with lively,
LINE 793: but silent, gestures he immediately urged her to intercede for him with
LINE 794: the lawyer. It was clear that he desperately needed to be told something
LINE 795: by the lawyer, although perhaps only so that he could make use of the
LINE 796: information with his other lawyers. Leni probably knew very well how
LINE 797: the lawyer could be brought round, pointed to his hand and pursed her
LINE 798: lips as if making a kiss. Block immediately performed the hand-kiss and,
LINE 799: at further urging from Leni, repeated it twice more. But the lawyer
LINE 800: continued to be silent. Then Leni leant over the lawyer, as she
LINE 801: stretched out, the attractive shape of her body could be seen, and,
LINE 802: bent over close to his face, she stroked his long white hair. That now
LINE 803: forced him to give an answer. "I'm rather wary of telling him," said
LINE 804: the lawyer, and his head could be seen shaking slightly, perhaps so that
LINE 805: he would feel the pressure of Leni's hand better. Block listened
LINE 806: closely with his head lowered, as if by listening he were breaking an
LINE 807: order. "What makes you so wary about it?" asked Leni. K. had the feeling
LINE 808: he was listening to a contrived dialogue that had been repeated many
LINE 809: times, that would be repeated many times more, and that for Block alone
LINE 810: it would never lose its freshness. "What has his behaviour been like
LINE 811: today?" asked the lawyer instead of an answer. Before Leni said
LINE 812: anything she looked down at Block and watched him a short while as he
LINE 813: raised his hands towards her and rubbed them together imploringly.
LINE 814: Finally she gave a serious nod, turned back to the lawyer and said,
LINE 815: "He's been quiet and industrious." This was an elderly businessman, a
LINE 816: man whose beard was long, and he was begging a young girl to speak on
LINE 817: his behalf. Even if there was some plan behind what he did, there was
LINE 818: nothing that could reinstate him in the eyes of his fellow man. K. could
LINE 819: not understand how the lawyer could have thought this performance would
LINE 820: win him over. Even if he had done nothing earlier to make him want to
LINE 821: leave then this scene would have done so. It was almost humiliating even
LINE 822: for the onlooker. So these were the lawyer's methods, which K.
LINE 823: fortunately had not been exposed to for long, to let the client forget
LINE 824: about the whole world and leave him with nothing but the hope of
LINE 825: reaching the end of his trial by this deluded means. He was no longer a
LINE 826: client, he was the lawyer's dog. If the lawyer had ordered him to crawl
LINE 827: under the bed as if it were a kennel and to bark out from under it, then
LINE 828: he would have done so with enthusiasm. K. listened to all of this,
LINE 829: testing it and thinking it over as if he had been given the task of
LINE 830: closely observing everything spoken here, inform a higher office about
LINE 831: it and write a report. "And what has he been doing all day?" asked the
LINE 832: lawyer. "I kept him locked in the maid's room all day," said Leni, "so
LINE 833: that he wouldn't stop me doing my work. That's where he usually stays.
LINE 834: From time to time I looked in through the spyhole to see what he was
LINE 835: doing, and each time he was kneeling on the bed and reading the papers
LINE 836: you gave him, propped up on the window sill. That made a good impression
LINE 837: on me; as the window only opens onto an air shaft and gives hardly any
LINE 838: light. It showed how obedient he is that he was even reading in those
LINE 839: conditions." "I'm pleased to hear it," said the lawyer. "But did he
LINE 840: understand what he was reading?" While this conversation was going on,
LINE 841: Block continually moved his lips and was clearly formulating the answers
LINE 842: he hoped Leni would give. "Well I can't give you any certain answer to
LINE 843: that of course," said Leni, "but I could see that he was reading
LINE 844: thoroughly. He spent all day reading the same page, running his finger
LINE 845: along the lines. Whenever I looked in on him he sighed as if this
LINE 846: reading was a lot of work for him. I expect the papers you gave him were
LINE 847: very hard to understand." "Yes," said the lawyer, "they certainly are
LINE 848: that. And I really don't think he understood anything of them. But they
LINE 849: should at least give him some inkling of just how hard a struggle it is
LINE 850: and how much work it is for me to defend him. And who am I doing all
LINE 851: this hard work for? I'm doing it--it's laughable even to say it--I'm
LINE 852: doing it for Block. He ought to realise what that means, too. Did he
LINE 853: study without a pause?" "Almost without a pause," answered Leni. "Just
LINE 854: the once he asked me for a drink of water, so I gave him a glassful
LINE 855: through the window. Then at eight o'clock I let him out and gave him
LINE 856: something to eat." Block glanced sideways at K., as if he were being
LINE 857: praised and had to impress K. as well. He now seemed more optimistic, he
LINE 858: moved more freely and rocked back and forth on his knees. This made his
LINE 859: astonishment all the more obvious when he heard the following words from
LINE 860: the lawyer: "You speak well of him," said the lawyer, "but that's just
LINE 861: what makes it difficult for me. You see, the judge did not speak well of
LINE 862: him at all, neither about Block nor about his case." "Didn't speak well
LINE 863: of him?" asked Leni. "How is that possible?" Block looked at her with
LINE 864: such tension he seemed to think that although the judge's words had been
LINE 865: spoken so long before she would be able to change them in his favour.
LINE 866: "Not at all," said the lawyer. "In fact he became quite cross when I
LINE 867: started to talk about Block to him. 'Don't talk to me about Block,' he
LINE 868: said. 'He is my client,' said I. 'You're letting him abuse you,' he
LINE 869: said. 'I don't think his case is lost yet,' said I. 'You're letting him
LINE 870: abuse you,' he repeated. 'I don't think so,' said I. 'Block works hard
LINE 871: in his case and always knows where it stands. He practically lives with
LINE 872: me so that he always knows what's happening. You don't always find such
LINE 873: enthusiasm as that. He's not very pleasant personally, I grant you, his
LINE 874: manners are terrible and he's dirty, but as far as the trial's concerned
LINE 875: he's quite immaculate.' I said immaculate, but I was deliberately
LINE 876: exaggerating. Then he said, 'Block is sly, that's all. He's accumulated
LINE 877: plenty of experience and knows how to delay proceedings. But there's
LINE 878: more that he doesn't know than he does. What do you think he'd say if he
LINE 879: learned his trial still hasn't begun, if you told him they haven't even
LINE 880: rung the bell to announce the start of proceedings?' Alright Block,
LINE 881: alright," said the lawyer, as at these words Block had begun to raise
LINE 882: himself on his trembling knees and clearly wanted to plead for some
LINE 883: explanation. It was the first time the lawyer had spoken any clear words
LINE 884: directly to Block. He looked down with his tired eyes, half blankly and
LINE 885: half at Block, who slowly sank back down on his knees under this gaze.
LINE 886: "What the judge said has no meaning for you," said the lawyer. "You
LINE 887: needn't be frightened at every word. If you do it again I won't tell you
LINE 888: anything else at all. It's impossible to start a sentence without you
LINE 889: looking at me as if you were receiving your final judgement. You should
LINE 890: be ashamed of yourself here in front of my client! And you're destroying
LINE 891: the trust he has for me. Just what is it you want? You're still alive,
LINE 892: you're still under my protection. There's no point in worrying!
LINE 893: Somewhere you've read that the final judgement can often come without
LINE 894: warning, from anyone at any time. And, in the right circumstances,
LINE 895: that's basically true, but it's also true that I dislike your anxiety
LINE 896: and fear and see that you don't have the trust in me you should have.
LINE 897: Now what have I just said? I repeated something said by one of the
LINE 898: judges. You know that there are so many various opinions about the
LINE 899: procedure that they form into a great big pile and nobody can make any
LINE 900: sense of them. This judge, for instance, sees proceedings as starting at
LINE 901: a different point from where I do. A difference of opinion, nothing
LINE 902: more. At a certain stage in the proceedings tradition has it that a sign
LINE 903: is given by ringing a bell. This judge sees that as the point at which
LINE 904: proceedings begin. I can't set out all the opinions opposed to that
LINE 905: view here, and you wouldn't understand it anyway, suffice it to say
LINE 906: that there are many reasons to disagree with him." Embarrassed, Block
LINE 907: ran his fingers through the pile of the carpet, his anxiety about what
LINE 908: the judge had said had let him forget his inferior status towards the
LINE 909: lawyer for a while, he thought only about himself and turned the judge's
LINE 910: words round to examine them from all sides. "Block," said Leni, as if
LINE 911: reprimanding him, and, taking hold of the collar of his coat, pulled him
LINE 912: up slightly higher. "Leave the carpet alone and listen to what the
LINE 913: lawyer is saying."
