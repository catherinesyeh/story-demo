LINE 1: In the Cathedral
LINE 2: A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to visit
LINE 3: the city for the first time and K. was given the task of showing him
LINE 4: some of its cultural sights. At any other time he would have seen this
LINE 5: job as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even to maintain
LINE 6: his current position in the bank, he accepted it only with reluctance.
LINE 7: Every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of concern
LINE 8: for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office
LINE 9: anything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hours merely
LINE 10: pretending to do important work, but that only increased his anxiety
LINE 11: about not being in the office. Then he sometimes thought he saw the
LINE 12: deputy director, who was always watching, come into K.'s office, sit at
LINE 13: his desk, look through his papers, receive clients who had almost
LINE 14: become old friends of K., and lure them away from him, perhaps he even
LINE 15: discovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten K. from a
LINE 16: thousand directions when he was at work now, and which he could no
LINE 17: longer avoid. So now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on
LINE 18: business or even needed to make a short business trip, however much an
LINE 19: honour it seemed--and tasks of this sort happened to have increased
LINE 20: substantially recently--there was always the suspicion that they wanted
LINE 21: to get him out of his office for a while and check his work, or at
LINE 22: least the idea that they thought he was dispensable. It would not have
LINE 23: been difficult for him to turn down most of these jobs, but he did not
LINE 24: dare to do so because, if his fears had the slightest foundation,
LINE 25: turning the jobs down would have been an acknowledgement of them. For
LINE 26: this reason, he never demurred from accepting them, and even when he
LINE 27: was asked to go on a tiring business trip lasting two days he said
LINE 28: nothing about having to go out in the rainy autumn weather when he had a
LINE 29: severe chill, just in order to avoid the risk of not being asked to go.
LINE 30: When, with a raging headache, he arrived back from this trip he learned
LINE 31: that he had been chosen to accompany the Italian business contact the
LINE 32: following day. The temptation for once to turn the job down was very
LINE 33: great, especially as it had no direct connection with business, but
LINE 34: there was no denying that social obligations towards this business
LINE 35: contact were in themselves important enough, only not for K., who knew
LINE 36: quite well that he needed some successes at work if he was to maintain
LINE 37: his position there and that, if he failed in that, it would not help
LINE 38: him even if this Italian somehow found him quite charming; he did not
LINE 39: want to be removed from his workplace for even one day, as the fear of
LINE 40: not being allowed back in was too great, he knew full well that the fear
LINE 41: was exaggerated but it still made him anxious. However, in this case it
LINE 42: was almost impossible to think of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge
LINE 43: of Italian was not great but still good enough; the deciding factor was
LINE 44: that K. had earlier known a little about art history and this had
LINE 45: become widely known around the bank in extremely exaggerated form, and
LINE 46: that K. had been a member of the Society for the Preservation of City
LINE 47: Monuments, albeit only for business reasons. It was said that this
LINE 48: Italian was an art lover, so the choice of K. to accompany him was a
LINE 49: matter of course.
LINE 50: It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K., in a foul temper at the
LINE 51: thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the
LINE 52: office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would
LINE 53: prevent him. He had spent half the night studying a book of Italian
LINE 54: grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very tired; his
LINE 55: desk was less attractive to him than the window where he had spent far
LINE 56: too much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptation and sat
LINE 57: down to his work. Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and
LINE 58: reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk
LINE 59: was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind
LINE 60: as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was
LINE 61: already there. "I'll come straight away," said K. He put a small
LINE 62: dictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites
LINE 63: under his arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the
LINE 64: deputy director's office into that of the director. He was glad he had
LINE 65: come into the office so early and was able to be of service
LINE 66: immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him. The
LINE 67: deputy director's office was, of course, still as empty as the middle
LINE 68: of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too
LINE 69: but without success. As K. entered the reception room two men stood up
LINE 70: from the deep armchairs where they had been sitting. The director gave
LINE 71: him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that K. was there, he
LINE 72: immediately introduced him to the Italian who shook K.'s hand
LINE 73: vigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser. K. did not quite
LINE 74: understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use
LINE 75: and it took K. a little while to guess its meaning. He replied with a
LINE 76: few bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh,
LINE 77: passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy
LINE 78: moustache. This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting
LINE 79: to come close to it and sniff. When they had all sat down and begun a
LINE 80: light preliminary conversation, K. was disconcerted to notice that he
LINE 81: understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said. When he
LINE 82: spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very
LINE 83: infrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be
LINE 84: enjoying himself so much his head shook. When he was talking in this
LINE 85: way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which
LINE 86: seemed to K. to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director
LINE 87: not only understood but also spoke, although K. ought to have foreseen
LINE 88: this as the Italian came from the south of his country where the
LINE 89: director had also spent several years. Whatever the cause, K. realised
LINE 90: that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely
LINE 91: taken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his
LINE 92: moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered
LINE 93: some help in understanding what he said. K. began to anticipate many
LINE 94: difficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian
LINE 95: said--with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it
LINE 96: would have been pointless effort--and for the time being did no more
LINE 97: than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in
LINE 98: the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored
LINE 99: jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands
LINE 100: freely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though
LINE 101: he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K.
LINE 102: had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange
LINE 103: between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his
LINE 104: alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly
LINE 105: getting up, turning round and leaving. Eventually the Italian looked at
LINE 106: the clock and jumped up. After taking his leave from the director he
LINE 107: turned to K., pressing himself so close to him that K. had to push his
LINE 108: chair back just so that he could move. The director had, no doubt, seen
LINE 109: the anxiety in K.'s eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of
LINE 110: Italian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so
LINE 111: adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor
LINE 112: comments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into
LINE 113: what the Italian said so that K. could understand. K. learned in this
LINE 114: way that the Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that
LINE 115: he unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he
LINE 116: certainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the
LINE 117: city, that he would much rather--at least as long as K. would agree, it
LINE 118: was entirely his decision--just see the cathedral and to do so
LINE 119: thoroughly. He was extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who
LINE 120: was so learned and so pleasant--by this he meant K., who was occupied
LINE 121: not with listening to the Italian but the director--and asked if he
LINE 122: would be so kind, if the time was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral
LINE 123: in two hours' time at about ten o'clock. He hoped he would certainly be
LINE 124: able to be there at that time. K. made an appropriate reply, the Italian
LINE 125: shook first the director's hand and then K.'s, then the director's again
LINE 126: and went to the door, half turned to the two men who followed him and
LINE 127: continuing to talk without a break. K. remained together with the
LINE 128: director for a short while, although the director looked especially
LINE 129: unhappy today. He thought he needed to apologise to K. for something and
LINE 130: told him--they were standing intimately close together--he had thought
LINE 131: at first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then--he gave no
LINE 132: more precise reason than this--then he decided it would be better to
LINE 133: send K. with him. He should not be surprised if he could not understand
LINE 134: the Italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he
LINE 135: really could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it
LINE 136: was really not so important for the Italian to be understood. And
LINE 137: anyway, K.'s knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good, the director
LINE 138: was sure he would get by very well. And with that, it was time for K. to
LINE 139: go. He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying
LINE 140: out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the
LINE 141: cathedral. It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the
LINE 142: mail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K.
LINE 143: was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to
LINE 144: them, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K. and
LINE 145: came in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked
LINE 146: through its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the
LINE 147: ante-room opened even clients would appear from the half-darkness and
LINE 148: bow timidly to him--they wanted to attract his attention but were not
LINE 149: sure whether he had seen them--all this activity was circling around K.
LINE 150: with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would
LINE 151: need, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then
LINE 152: practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart.
LINE 153: The good intentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left him
LINE 154: completely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and
LINE 155: sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary
LINE 156: under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but then
LINE 157: he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the
LINE 158: Italian without saying a word, so, in an even greater rage, he pulled
LINE 159: the dictionary back out again.
LINE 160: At exactly half past nine, just when he was about to leave, there was a
LINE 161: telephone call for him, Leni wished him good morning and asked how he
LINE 162: was, K. thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him to
LINE 163: talk now as he had to go to the cathedral. "To the cathedral?" asked
LINE 164: Leni. "Yes, to the cathedral." "What do you have to go to the cathedral
LINE 165: for?" said Leni. K. tried to explain it to her briefly, but he had
LINE 166: hardly begun when Leni suddenly said, "They're harassing you." One
LINE 167: thing that K. could not bear was pity that he had not wanted or
LINE 168: expected, he took his leave of her with two words, but as he put the
LINE 169: receiver back in its place he said, half to himself and half to the
LINE 170: girl on the other end of the line who could no longer hear him, "Yes,
LINE 171: they're harassing me."
LINE 172: By now the time was late and there was almost a danger he would not be
LINE 173: on time. He took a taxi to the cathedral, at the last moment he had
LINE 174: remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the
LINE 175: Italian earlier and so took it with him now. He held it on his knees
LINE 176: and drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey. The rain had
LINE 177: eased off slightly but it was still damp, chilly and dark, it would be
LINE 178: difficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold
LINE 179: flagstones might well make K.'s chill much worse. The square in front
LINE 180: of the cathedral was quite empty, K. remembered how even as a small
LINE 181: child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square
LINE 182: had the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, although
LINE 183: today, with the weather like this, it was more understandable. The
LINE 184: cathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of
LINE 185: going there on a day like this. K. hurried along both the side naves
LINE 186: but saw no-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was
LINE 187: kneeling at a picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it. Then, in
LINE 188: the distance, he saw a church official who limped away through a
LINE 189: doorway in the wall. K. had arrived on time, it had struck ten just as
LINE 190: he was entering the building, but the Italian still was not there. K.
LINE 191: went back to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while,
LINE 192: and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was
LINE 193: waiting at another entrance. He was nowhere to be found. Could the
LINE 194: director have misunderstood what time they had agreed on? How could
LINE 195: anyone understand someone like that properly anyway? Whatever had
LINE 196: happened, K. would have to wait for him for at least half an hour. As
LINE 197: he was tired he wanted to sit down, he went back inside the cathedral,
LINE 198: he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps, he moved it
LINE 199: with his foot to a nearby pew, wrapped himself up tighter in his coat,
LINE 200: put the collar up and sat down. To pass the time he opened the album
LINE 201: and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it
LINE 202: became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything
LINE 203: in the side nave next to him.
LINE 204: In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering on the
LINE 205: main altar, K. was not certain whether he had seen them earlier.
LINE 206: Perhaps they had only just been lit. Church staff creep silently as
LINE 207: part of their job, you don't notice them. When K. happened to turn
LINE 208: round he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not far
LINE 209: behind him. It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to illuminate
LINE 210: the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side
LINE 211: altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper. It was
LINE 212: discourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him,
LINE 213: there would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content
LINE 214: themselves with seeking out a few pictures with K.'s electric pocket
LINE 215: torch and looking at them one small part at a time. K. went over to a
LINE 216: nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a
LINE 217: few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar
LINE 218: picture by the light of his torch. The eternal light hung disturbingly
LINE 219: in front of it. The first thing that K. partly saw and partly guessed at
LINE 220: was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the
LINE 221: painting. He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked
LINE 222: ground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and
LINE 223: there. He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was
LINE 224: being played out in front of him. It was astonishing to see how he stood
LINE 225: there without going any closer. Perhaps it was his job to stand guard.
LINE 226: It was a long time since K. had looked at any pictures and he studied
LINE 227: the knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as
LINE 228: he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch. Then when
LINE 229: he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found an
LINE 230: interment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also a comparatively
LINE 231: new painting. He put his torch away and went back to his place.
LINE 232: There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer, but
LINE 233: outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold in
LINE 234: the cathedral as K. had expected he decided to stay there for the time
LINE 235: being. Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plain golden
LINE 236: crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost flat
LINE 237: and whose tips crossed over each other. The outside of the pulpit's
LINE 238: balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the
LINE 239: column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves,
LINE 240: some of them lively and some of them still. K. walked up to the pulpit
LINE 241: and examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with
LINE 242: great care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness
LINE 243: between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K. lay his
LINE 244: hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he
LINE 245: had been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence. Then K. happened
LINE 246: to notice one of the church staff standing behind the next row of pews,
LINE 247: he wore a loose, creased, black cassock, he held a snuff box in his
LINE 248: left hand and he was watching K. Now what does he want? thought K. Do I
LINE 249: seem suspicious to him? Does he want a tip? But when the man in the
LINE 250: cassock saw that K. had noticed him he raised his right hand, a pinch
LINE 251: of snuff still held between two fingers, and pointed in some vague
LINE 252: direction. It was almost impossible to understand what this behaviour
LINE 253: meant, K. waited a while longer but the man in the cassock did not stop
LINE 254: gesturing with his hand and even augmented it by nodding his head. "Now
LINE 255: what does he want?" asked K. quietly, he did not dare call out loud
LINE 256: here; but then he drew out his purse and pushed his way through the
LINE 257: nearest pews to reach the man. He, however, immediately gestured to
LINE 258: turn down this offer, shrugged his shoulders and limped away. As a child
LINE 259: K. had imitated riding on a horse with the same sort of movement as
LINE 260: this limp. "This old man is like a child," thought K., "he doesn't have
LINE 261: the sense for anything more than serving in a church. Look at the way
LINE 262: he stops when I stop, and how he waits to see whether I'll continue."
LINE 263: With a smile, K. followed the old man all the way up the side nave and
LINE 264: almost as far as the main altar, all this time the old man continued to
LINE 265: point at something but K. deliberately avoided looking round, he was
LINE 266: only pointing in order to make it harder for K. to follow him.
LINE 267: Eventually, K. did stop following, he did not want to worry the old man
LINE 268: too much, and he also did not want to frighten him away completely in
LINE 269: case the Italian turned up after all.
LINE 270: When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the
LINE 271: album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to
LINE 272: the stalls by the altar where the choir sat. It was very simple, made
LINE 273: of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like
LINE 274: an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been. It
LINE 275: certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step
LINE 276: back from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it,
LINE 277: the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of
LINE 278: average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain
LINE 279: bent forward over the balustrade. In all, it looked as if it had been
LINE 280: intended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why
LINE 281: this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available
LINE 282: which were large and so artistically decorated.
LINE 283: And K. would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if there had
LINE 284: not been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant there was a
LINE 285: sermon about to be given. So was a sermon to be given now? In this
LINE 286: empty church? K. looked down at the steps which, pressed close against
LINE 287: the column, led up to the pulpit. They were so narrow they seemed to be
LINE 288: there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use. But
LINE 289: under the pulpit--K. grinned in astonishment--there really was a priest
LINE 290: standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and
LINE 291: looking at K. Then he nodded very slightly, so that K. crossed himself
LINE 292: and genuflected as he should have done earlier. With a little swing,
LINE 293: the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps. Was there
LINE 294: really a sermon about to begin? Maybe the man in the cassock had not
LINE 295: been really so demented, and had meant to lead K.'s way to the
LINE 296: preacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary.
LINE 297: And there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary,
LINE 298: an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon. And if there was
LINE 299: to be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ? But the
LINE 300: organ remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of
LINE 301: its great height.
LINE 302: K. now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he
LINE 303: did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the
LINE 304: sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had
LINE 305: lost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had
LINE 306: long been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked
LINE 307: at his watch, it was eleven. But could there really be a sermon given?
LINE 308: Could K. constitute the entire congregation? How could he when he was
LINE 309: just a stranger who wanted to look at the church? That, basically, was
LINE 310: all he was. The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday,
LINE 311: in hideous weather, was nonsense. The priest--there was no doubt that
LINE 312: he was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face--was clearly
LINE 313: going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by
LINE 314: mistake.
LINE 315: But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that
LINE 316: the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned
LINE 317: to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular
LINE 318: rail with both hands. He stood there like that for a while and, without
LINE 319: turning his head, looked around. K. had moved back a long way and leant
LINE 320: his elbows on the front pew. Somewhere in the church--he could not have
LINE 321: said exactly where--he could make out the man in the cassock hunched
LINE 322: under his bent back and at peace, as if his work were completed. In the
LINE 323: cathedral it was now very quiet! But K. would have to disturb that
LINE 324: silence, he had no intention of staying there; if it was the priest's
LINE 325: duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the circumstances then
LINE 326: he could, and he could do it without K.'s taking part, and K.'s
LINE 327: presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it. So K. began
LINE 328: slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew, arrived at the
LINE 329: broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed, except for the
LINE 330: sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the stone floor
LINE 331: and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a repeating,
LINE 332: regular pace. K. felt slightly abandoned as, probably observed by the
LINE 333: priest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, and the size of
LINE 334: the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man could bear.
LINE 335: When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate
LINE 336: but simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with
LINE 337: him. He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was close to the
LINE 338: empty space between himself and the exit when, for the first time, he
LINE 339: heard the voice of the priest. A powerful and experienced voice. It
LINE 340: pierced through the reaches of the cathedral ready waiting for it! But
LINE 341: the priest was not calling out to the congregation, his cry was quite
LINE 342: unambiguous and there was no escape from it, he called "Josef K.!"
LINE 343: K. stood still and looked down at the floor. In theory he was still
LINE 344: free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark
LINE 345: little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there. It
LINE 346: would simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but
LINE 347: chose not to pay attention to it. But if he once turned round he would
LINE 348: be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood
LINE 349: perfectly well, that he really was the Josef K. the priest had called
LINE 350: to and that he was willing to follow. If the priest had called out
LINE 351: again K. would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything
LINE 352: was silent as K. also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted
LINE 353: to see what the priest was doing now. He was merely standing in the
LINE 354: pulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had seen K. turn his head.
LINE 355: If K. did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child
LINE 356: playing hide and seek. He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his
LINE 357: finger. As everything could now be done openly he ran--because of
LINE 358: curiosity and the wish to get it over with--with long flying leaps
LINE 359: towards the pulpit. At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he
LINE 360: still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply
LINE 361: down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit. And
LINE 362: K. did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a
LINE 363: long way back just to see the priest. "You are Josef K.," said the
LINE 364: priest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose
LINE 365: meaning was unclear. "Yes," said K., he considered how freely he had
LINE 366: always given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a
LINE 367: burden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had
LINE 368: never seen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and
LINE 369: only then for people to know who you were. "You have been accused,"
LINE 370: said the priest, especially gently. "Yes," said K., "so I have been
LINE 371: informed." "Then you are the one I am looking for," said the priest. "I
LINE 372: am the prison chaplain." "I see," said K. "I had you summoned here,"
LINE 373: said the priest, "because I wanted to speak to you." "I knew nothing of
LINE 374: that," said K. "I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from
LINE 375: Italy." "That is beside the point," said the priest. "What are you
LINE 376: holding in your hand? Is it a prayer book?" "No," answered K., "it's an
LINE 377: album of the city's tourist sights." "Put it down," said the priest. K.
LINE 378: threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across
LINE 379: the floor, tearing its pages. "Do you know your case is going badly?"
LINE 380: asked the priest. "That's how it seems to me too," said K. "I've
LINE 381: expended a lot of effort on it, but so far with no result. Although I do
LINE 382: still have some documents to submit." "How do you imagine it will end?"
LINE 383: asked the priest. "At first I thought it was bound to end well," said
LINE 384: K., "but now I have my doubts about it. I don't know how it will end. Do
LINE 385: you know?" "I don't," said the priest, "but I fear it will end badly.
LINE 386: You are considered guilty. Your case will probably not even go beyond a
LINE 387: minor court. Provisionally at least, your guilt is seen as proven."
LINE 388: "But I'm not guilty," said K., "there's been a mistake. How is it even
LINE 389: possible for someone to be guilty? We're all human beings here, one
LINE 390: like the other." "That is true," said the priest, "but that is how the
LINE 391: guilty speak." "Do you presume I'm guilty too?" asked K. "I make no
LINE 392: presumptions about you," said the priest. "I thank you for that," said
LINE 393: K. "but everyone else involved in these proceedings has something
LINE 394: against me and presumes I'm guilty. They even influence those who
LINE 395: aren't involved. My position gets harder all the time." "You don't
LINE 396: understand the facts," said the priest, "the verdict does not come
LINE 397: suddenly, proceedings continue until a verdict is reached gradually."
LINE 398: "I see," said K., lowering his head. "What do you intend to do about
LINE 399: your case next?" asked the priest. "I still need to find help," said
LINE 400: K., raising his head to see what the priest thought of this. "There are
LINE 401: still certain possibilities I haven't yet made use of." "You look for
LINE 402: too much help from people you don't know," said the priest
LINE 403: disapprovingly, "and especially from women. Can you really not see
LINE 404: that's not the help you need?" "Sometimes, in fact quite often, I could
LINE 405: believe you're right," said K., "but not always. Women have a lot of
LINE 406: power. If I could persuade some of the women I know to work together
LINE 407: with me then I would be certain to succeed. Especially in a court like
LINE 408: this that seems to consist of nothing but woman-chasers. Show the
LINE 409: examining judge a woman in the distance and he'll run right over the
LINE 410: desk, and the accused, just to get to her as soon as he can." The
LINE 411: priest lowered his head down to the balustrade, only now did the roof
LINE 412: over the pulpit seem to press him down. What sort of dreadful weather
LINE 413: could it be outside? It was no longer just a dull day, it was deepest
LINE 414: night. None of the stained glass in the main window shed even a flicker
LINE 415: of light on the darkness of the walls. And this was the moment when the
LINE 416: man in the cassock chose to put out the candles on the main altar, one
LINE 417: by one. "Are you cross with me?" asked K. "Maybe you don't know what
LINE 418: sort of court it is you serve." He received no answer. "Well, it's just
LINE 419: my own experience," said K. Above him there was still silence. "I didn't
LINE 420: mean to insult you," said K. At that, the priest screamed down at K.:
LINE 421: "Can you not see two steps in front of you?" He shouted in anger, but it
LINE 422: was also the scream of one who sees another fall and, shocked and
LINE 423: without thinking, screams against his own will.
LINE 424: The two men, then, remained silent for a long time. In the darkness
LINE 425: beneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K. distinctly,
LINE 426: although K. was able to see him clearly by the light of the little
LINE 427: lamp. Why did the priest not come down? He had not given a sermon, he
LINE 428: had only told K. a few things which, if he followed them closely, would
LINE 429: probably cause him more harm than good. But the priest certainly seemed
LINE 430: to mean well, it might even be possible, if he would come down and
LINE 431: co-operate with him, it might even be possible for him to obtain some
LINE 432: acceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference, it
LINE 433: might, for instance, be able to show him not so much to influence the
LINE 434: proceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade them, how to
LINE 435: live away from them. K. had to admit that this was something he had had
LINE 436: on his mind quite a lot of late. If the priest knew of such a
LINE 437: possibility he might, if K. asked him, let him know about it, even
LINE 438: though he was part of the court himself and even though, when K. had
LINE 439: criticised the court, he had held down his gentle nature and actually
LINE 440: shouted at K.
LINE 441: "Would you not like to come down here?" asked K. "If you're not going
LINE 442: to give a sermon come down here with me." "Now I can come down," said
LINE 443: the priest, perhaps he regretted having shouted at K. As he took down
LINE 444: the lamp from its hook he said, "to start off with I had to speak to
LINE 445: you from a distance. Otherwise I'm too easily influenced and forget my
LINE 446: duty."
LINE 447: K. waited for him at the foot of the steps. While he was still on one
LINE 448: of the higher steps as he came down them the priest reached out his
LINE 449: hand for K. to shake. "Can you spare me a little of your time?" asked
LINE 450: K. "As much time as you need," said the priest, and passed him the
LINE 451: little lamp for him to carry. Even at close distance the priest did not
LINE 452: lose a certain solemnity that seemed to be part of his character. "You
LINE 453: are very friendly towards me," said K., as they walked up and down
LINE 454: beside each other in the darkness of one of the side naves. "That makes
LINE 455: you an exception among all those who belong to the court. I can trust
LINE 456: you more than any of the others I've seen. I can speak openly with you."
LINE 457: "Don't fool yourself," said the priest. "How would I be fooling myself?"
LINE 458: asked K. "You fool yourself in the court," said the priest, "it talks
LINE 459: about this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law. In front of
LINE 460: the law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to
LINE 461: the door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in
LINE 462: to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if
LINE 463: he'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the doorkeeper,
LINE 464: 'but not now.' The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the
LINE 465: doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and
LINE 466: see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, 'If you're
LINE 467: tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't.
LINE 468: Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest of all the
LINE 469: doormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of
LINE 470: them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can stand just to
LINE 471: look at the third one.' The man from the country had not expected
LINE 472: difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible for
LINE 473: anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at the
LINE 474: doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long thin
LINE 475: tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has
LINE 476: permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit
LINE 477: down to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years. He tries
LINE 478: to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with his
LINE 479: requests. The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where he's
LINE 480: from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions such
LINE 481: as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still can't
LINE 482: let him in. The man had come well equipped for his journey, and uses
LINE 483: everything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He accepts
LINE 484: everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that
LINE 485: you don't think there's anything you've failed to do.' Over many years,
LINE 486: the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He forgets about
LINE 487: the other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thing
LINE 488: stopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first few years he
LINE 489: curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he becomes old, he
LINE 490: just grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he has come to know
LINE 491: even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has
LINE 492: been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the
LINE 493: doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no longer knows
LINE 494: whether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that are deceiving
LINE 495: him. But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light begin to shine
LINE 496: from the darkness behind the door. He doesn't have long to live now.
LINE 497: Just before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this
LINE 498: time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper.
LINE 499: He beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body. The
LINE 500: doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has
LINE 501: changed very much to the disadvantage of the man. 'What is it you want
LINE 502: to know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants
LINE 503: access to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years,
LINE 504: no-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's
LINE 505: come to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard,
LINE 506: he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this
LINE 507: entrance was meant only for you. Now I'll go and close it.'"
LINE 508: "So the doorkeeper cheated the man," said K. immediately, who had been
LINE 509: captivated by the story. "Don't be too quick," said the priest, "don't
LINE 510: take somebody else's opinion without checking it. I told you the story
LINE 511: exactly as it was written. There's nothing in there about cheating."
LINE 512: "But it's quite clear," said K., "and your first interpretation of it
LINE 513: was quite correct. The doorkeeper gave him the information that would
LINE 514: release him only when it could be of no more use." "He didn't ask him
LINE 515: before that," said the priest, "and don't forget he was only a
LINE 516: doorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty." "What makes you think
LINE 517: he did his duty?" asked K., "He didn't. It might have been his duty to
LINE 518: keep everyone else away, but this man is who the door was intended for
LINE 519: and he ought to have let him in." "You're not paying enough attention
LINE 520: to what was written and you're changing the story," said the priest.
LINE 521: "According to the story, there are two important things that the
LINE 522: doorkeeper explains about access to the law, one at the beginning, one
LINE 523: at the end. At one place he says he can't allow him in now, and at the
LINE 524: other he says this entrance was intended for him alone. If one of the
LINE 525: statements contradicted the other you would be right and the doorkeeper
LINE 526: would have cheated the man from the country. But there is no
LINE 527: contradiction. On the contrary, the first statement even hints at the
LINE 528: second. You could almost say the doorkeeper went beyond his duty in
LINE 529: that he offered the man some prospect of being admitted in the future.
LINE 530: Throughout the story, his duty seems to have been merely to turn the
LINE 531: man away, and there are many commentators who are surprised that the
LINE 532: doorkeeper offered this hint at all, as he seems to love exactitude and
LINE 533: keeps strict guard over his position. He stays at his post for many
LINE 534: years and doesn't close the gate until the very end, he's very
LINE 535: conscious of the importance of his service, as he says, 'I'm powerful,'
LINE 536: he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only the lowliest of
LINE 537: the doormen,' he's not talkative, as through all these years the only
LINE 538: questions he asks are 'disinterested,' he's not corruptible, as when
LINE 539: he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't
LINE 540: think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as fulfilling his
LINE 541: duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it says about the
LINE 542: man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests,' even his
LINE 543: external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big hooked nose
LINE 544: and the long, thin, black tartar-beard. How could any doorkeeper be
LINE 545: more faithful to his duty? But in the doorkeeper's character there are
LINE 546: also other features which might be very useful for those who seek entry
LINE 547: to the law, and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it
LINE 548: always seemed to make it clear that he might even go beyond his duty.
LINE 549: There's no denying he's a little simple-minded, and that makes him a
LINE 550: little conceited. Even if all he said about his power and the power of
LINE 551: the other doorkeepers and how not even he could bear the sight of
LINE 552: them--I say even if all these assertions are right, the way he makes
LINE 553: them shows that he's too simple and arrogant to understand properly.
LINE 554: The commentators say about this that, 'correct understanding of a matter
LINE 555: and a misunderstanding of the same matter are not mutually exclusive.'
LINE 556: Whether they're right or not, you have to concede that his simplicity
LINE 557: and arrogance, however little they show, do weaken his function of
LINE 558: guarding the entrance, they are defects in the doorkeeper's character.
LINE 559: You also have to consider that the doorkeeper seems to be friendly by
LINE 560: nature, he isn't always just an official. He makes a joke right at the
LINE 561: beginning, in that he invites the man to enter at the same time as
LINE 562: maintaining the ban on his entering, and then he doesn't send him away
LINE 563: but gives him, as it says in the text, a stool to sit on and lets him
LINE 564: stay by the side of the door. The patience with which he puts up with
LINE 565: the man's requests through all these years, the little questioning
LINE 566: sessions, accepting the gifts, his politeness when he puts up with the
LINE 567: man cursing his fate even though it was the doorkeeper who caused that
LINE 568: fate--all these things seem to want to arouse our sympathy. Not every
LINE 569: doorkeeper would have behaved in the same way. And finally, he lets the
LINE 570: man beckon him and he bends deep down to him so that he can put his
LINE 571: last question. There's no more than some slight impatience--the
LINE 572: doorkeeper knows everything's come to its end--shown in the words,
LINE 573: 'You're insatiable.' There are many commentators who go even further in
LINE 574: explaining it in this way and think the words, 'you're insatiable' are
LINE 575: an expression of friendly admiration, albeit with some condescension.
LINE 576: However you look at it the figure of the doorkeeper comes out
LINE 577: differently from how you might think." "You know the story better than
LINE 578: I do and you've known it for longer," said K. They were silent for a
LINE 579: while. And then K. said, "So you think the man was not cheated, do
LINE 580: you?" "Don't get me wrong," said the priest, "I'm just pointing out the
LINE 581: different opinions about it. You shouldn't pay too much attention to
LINE 582: people's opinions. The text cannot be altered, and the various opinions
LINE 583: are often no more than an expression of despair over it. There's even
LINE 584: one opinion which says it's the doorkeeper who's been cheated." "That
LINE 585: does seem to take things too far," said K. "How can they argue the
LINE 586: doorkeeper has been cheated?" "Their argument," answered the priest,
LINE 587: "is based on the simplicity of the doorkeeper. They say the doorkeeper
LINE 588: doesn't know the inside of the law, only the way into it where he just
LINE 589: walks up and down. They see his ideas of what's inside the law as
LINE 590: rather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants to
LINE 591: make the man frightened of. Yes, he's more afraid of it than the man, as
LINE 592: the man wants nothing but to go inside the law, even after he's heard
LINE 593: about the terrible doormen there, in contrast to the doorkeeper who
LINE 594: doesn't want to go in, or at least we don't hear anything about it. On
LINE 595: the other hand, there are those who say he must have already been inside
LINE 596: the law as he has been taken on into its service and that could only
LINE 597: have been done inside. That can be countered by supposing he could have
LINE 598: been given the job of doorkeeper by somebody calling out from inside,
LINE 599: and that he can't have gone very far inside as he couldn't bear the
LINE 600: sight of the third doorkeeper. Nor, through all those years, does the
LINE 601: story say the doorkeeper told the man anything about the inside, other
LINE 602: than his comment about the other doorkeepers. He could have been
LINE 603: forbidden to do so, but he hasn't said anything about that either. All
LINE 604: this seems to show he doesn't know anything about what the inside looks
LINE 605: like or what it means, and that that's why he's being deceived. But he's
LINE 606: also being deceived by the man from the country as he's this man's
LINE 607: subordinate and doesn't know it. There's a lot to indicate that he
LINE 608: treats the man as his subordinate, I expect you remember, but those who
LINE 609: hold this view would say it's very clear that he really is his
LINE 610: subordinate. Above all, the free man is superior to the man who has to
LINE 611: serve another. Now, the man really is free, he can go wherever he wants,
LINE 612: the only thing forbidden to him is entry into the law and, what's more,
LINE 613: there's only one man forbidding him to do so--the doorkeeper. If he
LINE 614: takes the stool and sits down beside the door and stays there all his
LINE 615: life he does this of his own free will, there's nothing in the story to
LINE 616: say he was forced to do it. On the other hand, the doorkeeper is kept to
LINE 617: his post by his employment, he's not allowed to go away from it and it
LINE 618: seems he's not allowed to go inside either, not even if he wanted to.
LINE 619: Also, although he's in the service of the law he's only there for this
LINE 620: one entrance, therefore he's there only in the service of this one man
LINE 621: who the door's intended for. This is another way in which he's his
LINE 622: subordinate. We can take it that he's been performing this somewhat
LINE 623: empty service for many years, through the whole of a man's life, as it
LINE 624: says that a man will come, that means someone old enough to be a man.
LINE 625: That means the doorkeeper will have to wait a long time before his
LINE 626: function is fulfilled, he will have to wait for as long as the man
LINE 627: liked, who came to the door of his own free will. Even the end of the
LINE 628: doorkeeper's service is determined by when the man's life ends, so the
LINE 629: doorkeeper remains his subordinate right to the end. And it's pointed
LINE 630: out repeatedly that the doorkeeper seems to know nothing of any of
LINE 631: this, although this is not seen as anything remarkable, as those who
LINE 632: hold this view see the doorkeeper as deluded in a way that's far worse,
LINE 633: a way that's to do with his service. At the end, speaking about the
LINE 634: entrance he says, 'Now I'll go and close it,' although at the beginning
LINE 635: of the story it says the door to the law is open as it always is, but if
LINE 636: it's always open--always--that means it's open independently of the
LINE 637: lifespan of the man it's intended for, and not even the doorkeeper will
LINE 638: be able to close it. There are various opinions about this, some say
LINE 639: the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to
LINE 640: duty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper
LINE 641: wanted to cause him regret and sorrow. There are many who agree that he
LINE 642: wouldn't be able to close the door. They even believe, at the end at
LINE 643: least, the doorkeeper is aware, deep down, that he's the man's
LINE 644: subordinate, as the man sees the light that shines out of the entry to
LINE 645: the law whereas the doorkeeper would probably have his back to it and
LINE 646: says nothing at all to show there's been any change." "That is well
LINE 647: substantiated," said K., who had been repeating some parts of the
LINE 648: priest's explanation to himself in a whisper. "It is well substantiated,
LINE 649: and now I too think the doorkeeper must have been deceived. Although
LINE 650: that does not mean I've abandoned what I thought earlier as the two
LINE 651: versions are, to some extent, not incompatible. It's not clear whether
LINE 652: the doorkeeper sees clearly or is deceived. I said the man had been
LINE 653: cheated. If the doorkeeper understands clearly, then there could be some
LINE 654: doubt about it, but if the doorkeeper has been deceived then the man is
LINE 655: bound to believe the same thing. That would mean the doorkeeper is not a
LINE 656: cheat but so simple-minded that he ought to be dismissed from his job
LINE 657: immediately; if the doorkeeper is mistaken it will do him no harm but
LINE 658: the man will be harmed immensely." "There you've found another opinion,"
LINE 659: said the priest, "as there are many who say the story doesn't give
LINE 660: anyone the right to judge the doorkeeper. However he might seem to us he
LINE 661: is still in the service of the law, so he belongs to the law, so he's
LINE 662: beyond what man has a right to judge. In this case we can't believe the
LINE 663: doorkeeper is the man's subordinate. Even if he has to stay at the
LINE 664: entrance into the law his service makes him incomparably more than if he
LINE 665: lived freely in the world. The man has come to the law for the first
LINE 666: time and the doorkeeper is already there. He's been given his position
LINE 667: by the law, to doubt his worth would be to doubt the law." "I can't say
LINE 668: I'm in complete agreement with this view," said K. shaking his head, "as
LINE 669: if you accept it you'll have to accept that everything said by the
LINE 670: doorkeeper is true. But you've already explained very fully that that's
LINE 671: not possible." "No," said the priest, "you don't need to accept
LINE 672: everything as true, you only have to accept it as necessary."
LINE 673: "Depressing view," said K. "The lie made into the rule of the world."
LINE 674: K. said that as if it were his final word but it was not his
LINE 675: conclusion. He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of
LINE 676: the story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar
LINE 677: to him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the
LINE 678: court to discuss than for him. The simple story had lost its shape, he
LINE 679: wanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate
LINE 680: allowed this and accepted K.'s remarks without comment, even though his
LINE 681: view was certainly very different from K.'s.
LINE 682: In silence, they carried on walking for some time, K. stayed close
LINE 683: beside the priest without knowing where he was. The lamp in his hand
LINE 684: had long since gone out. Once, just in front of him, he thought he
LINE 685: could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it,
LINE 686: although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness. So that he would
LINE 687: not remain entirely dependent on the priest, K. asked him, "We're now
LINE 688: near the main entrance, are we?" "No," said the priest, "we're a long
LINE 689: way from it. Do you already want to go?" K. had not thought of going
LINE 690: until then, but he immediately said, "Yes, certainly, I have to go. I'm
LINE 691: the chief clerk in a bank and there are people waiting for me, I only
LINE 692: came here to show a foreign business contact round the cathedral."
LINE 693: "Alright," said the priest offering him his hand, "go then." "But I
LINE 694: can't find my way round in this darkness by myself," said K. "Go to your
LINE 695: left as far as the wall," said the priest, "then continue alongside the
LINE 696: wall without leaving it and you'll find a way out." The priest had only
LINE 697: gone a few paces from him, but K. was already shouting loudly, "Please,
LINE 698: wait!" "I'm waiting," said the priest. "Is there anything else you want
LINE 699: from me?" asked K. "No," said the priest. "You were so friendly to me
LINE 700: earlier on," said K., "and you explained everything, but now you
