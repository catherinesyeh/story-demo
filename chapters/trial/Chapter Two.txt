LINE 1: First Cross-examination
LINE 2: K. was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing
LINE 3: concerning his case the following Sunday. He was made aware that these
LINE 4: cross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not every
LINE 5: week but quite frequently. On the one hand it was in everyone's interest
LINE 6: to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand
LINE 7: every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly
LINE 8: without lasting too long because of the associated stress. For these
LINE 9: reasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations
LINE 10: following on one after another. Sunday had been chosen as the day for
LINE 11: the hearings so that K. would not be disturbed in his professional work.
LINE 12: It was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wished
LINE 13: for another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated.
LINE 14: Cross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K.
LINE 15: would probably not be fresh enough at that time. Anyway, as long as K.
LINE 16: made no objection, the hearing would be left on Sundays. It was a matter
LINE 17: of course that he would have to appear without fail, there was probably
LINE 18: no need to point this out to him. He would be given the number of the
LINE 19: building where he was to present himself, which was in a street in a
LINE 20: suburb well away from the city centre which K. had never been to before.
LINE 21: Once he had received this notice, K. hung up the receiver without giving
LINE 22: an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it was
LINE 23: certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to it,
LINE 24: and this first examination would probably also be the last. He was still
LINE 25: standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of the
LINE 26: deputy director behind him--he wanted to use the telephone but K. stood
LINE 27: in his way. "Bad news?" asked the deputy director casually, not in order
LINE 28: to find anything out but just to get K. away from the device. "No, no,"
LINE 29: said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely. The deputy
LINE 30: director picked up the receiver and, as he waited for his connection,
LINE 31: turned away from it and said to K., "One question, Mr. K.: Would you
LINE 32: like to give me the pleasure of joining me on my sailing boat on Sunday
LINE 33: morning? There's quite a few people coming, you're bound to know some
LINE 34: of them. One of them is Hasterer, the state attorney. Would you like to
LINE 35: come along? Do come along!" K. tried to pay attention to what the
LINE 36: deputy director was saying. It was of no small importance for him, as
LINE 37: this invitation from the deputy director, with whom he had never got on
LINE 38: very well, meant that he was trying to improve his relations with him.
LINE 39: It showed how important K. had become in the bank and how its second
LINE 40: most important official seemed to value his friendship, or at least his
LINE 41: impartiality. He was only speaking at the side of the telephone receiver
LINE 42: while he waited for his connection, but in giving this invitation the
LINE 43: deputy director was humbling himself. But K. would have to humiliate him
LINE 44: a second time as a result, he said, "Thank you very much, but I'm afraid
LINE 45: I will have no time on Sunday, I have a previous obligation." "Pity,"
LINE 46: said the deputy director, and turned to the telephone conversation that
LINE 47: had just been connected. It was not a short conversation, but K.
LINE 48: remained standing confused by the instrument all the time it was going
LINE 49: on. It was only when the deputy director hung up that he was shocked
LINE 50: into awareness and said, in order to partially excuse his standing there
LINE 51: for no reason, "I've just received a telephone call, there's somewhere I
LINE 52: need to go, but they forgot to tell me what time." "Ask them then," said
LINE 53: the deputy director. "It's not that important," said K., although in
LINE 54: that way his earlier excuse, already weak enough, was made even weaker.
LINE 55: As he went, the deputy director continued to speak about other things.
LINE 56: K. forced himself to answer, but his thoughts were mainly about that
LINE 57: Sunday, how it would be best to get there for nine o'clock in the
LINE 58: morning as that was the time that courts always start work on weekdays.
LINE 59: The weather was dull on Sunday. K. was very tired, as he had stayed out
LINE 60: drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the regulars,
LINE 61: and he had almost overslept. He dressed hurriedly, without the time to
LINE 62: think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week.
LINE 63: With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been told about. Oddly
LINE 64: enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across
LINE 65: the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and
LINE 66: Kaminer. The first two were travelling in a tram that went across K.'s
LINE 67: route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a caf√© and leant curiously
LINE 68: over the wall as K. came over. All of them seemed to be looking at him,
LINE 69: surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that
LINE 70: made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help
LINE 71: from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to
LINE 72: avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the
LINE 73: affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to
LINE 74: humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual. Anyway,
LINE 75: now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all
LINE 76: possible, even though he had no appointment for this time.
LINE 77: He had thought that he would recognise the building from a distance by
LINE 78: some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign would look
LINE 79: like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the entrance. K.
LINE 80: had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but when he stood
LINE 81: at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but
LINE 82: monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats occupied by poor
LINE 83: people. Now, on a Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men
LINE 84: in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully and gently held
LINE 85: small children on the sills. Other windows were piled up with bedding,
LINE 86: above which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear. People
LINE 87: called out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a
LINE 88: loud laugh about K. himself. It was a long street, and spaced evenly
LINE 89: along it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of
LINE 90: foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps. Women went in
LINE 91: and out of them or stood chatting on the steps. A fruitmonger, taking
LINE 92: his goods up to the windows, was just as inattentive as K. and nearly
LINE 93: knocked him down with his cart. Just then, a gramophone, which in better
LINE 94: parts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some
LINE 95: murderous tune.
LINE 96: K. went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time
LINE 97: now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of
LINE 98: the windows and therefore knew that K. had found his way there. It was
LINE 99: shortly after nine. The building was quite far down the street, it
LINE 100: covered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in
LINE 101: particular was tall and long. It was clearly intended for delivery
LINE 102: wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were
LINE 103: now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K. knew
LINE 104: from his work at the bank. In contrast with his usual habits, he
LINE 105: remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all
LINE 106: these external details. Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting on
LINE 107: a crate and reading a newspaper. There were two lads swinging on a hand
LINE 108: cart. In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket who, as
LINE 109: the water flowed into her can, looked at K. There was a piece of rope
LINE 110: stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some washing
LINE 111: hanging on it to dry. A man stood below it calling out instructions to
LINE 112: direct the work being done.
LINE 113: K. went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to
LINE 114: take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he could
LINE 115: see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a small
LINE 116: passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard. It
LINE 117: irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the
LINE 118: room, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or
LINE 119: especially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very
LINE 120: loudly and very unambiguously. In the end he decided to climb up the
LINE 121: stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the
LINE 122: policeman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the
LINE 123: guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway
LINE 124: that K. selected by chance.
LINE 125: As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on the
LINE 126: stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows. "Next time I
LINE 127: come here," he said to himself, "I must either bring sweets with me to
LINE 128: make them like me or a stick to hit them with." Just before he reached
LINE 129: the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had
LINE 130: finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces like grown-up
LINE 131: scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if he were to
LINE 132: shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid of what
LINE 133: noise they would make by shouting.
LINE 134: On the first floor, his search began for real. He still felt unable to
LINE 135: ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a joiner called
LINE 136: Lanz--that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs. Grubach's
LINE 137: nephew, was called Lanz--so that he could ask at every flat whether Lanz
LINE 138: the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms.
LINE 139: It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further
LINE 140: ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and
LINE 141: out. Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms where they also did the
LINE 142: cooking. Many women held babies in one arm and worked at the stove with
LINE 143: the other. Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their
LINE 144: pinafores worked hardest running to and fro. In every room, the beds
LINE 145: were still in use by people who were ill, or still asleep, or people
LINE 146: stretched out on them in their clothes. K. knocked at the flats where
LINE 147: the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner lived there. It
LINE 148: was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to
LINE 149: somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed. "The
LINE 150: gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here." "A joiner,
LINE 151: called Lanz?" he would ask from the bed." "That's right," K. would say,
LINE 152: although it was clear that the investigating committee was not to be
LINE 153: found there, and so his task was at an end. There were many who thought
LINE 154: it must be very important for K. to find Lanz the joiner and thought
LINE 155: long about it, naming a joiner who was not called Lanz or giving a name
LINE 156: that had some vague similarity with Lanz, or they asked neighbours or
LINE 157: accompanied K. to a door a long way away where they thought someone of
LINE 158: that sort might live in the back part of the building or where someone
LINE 159: would be who could advise K. better than they could themselves. K.
LINE 160: eventually had to give up asking if he did not want to be led all round
LINE 161: from floor to floor in this way. He regretted his initial plan, which
LINE 162: had at first seemed so practical to him. As he reached the fifth floor,
LINE 163: he decided to give up the search, took his leave of a friendly, young
LINE 164: worker who wanted to lead him on still further and went down the stairs.
LINE 165: But then the thought of how much time he was wasting made him cross, he
LINE 166: went back again and knocked at the first door on the fifth floor. The
LINE 167: first thing he saw in the small room was a large clock on the wall which
LINE 168: already showed ten o'clock. "Is there a joiner called Lanz who lives
LINE 169: here?" he asked. "Pardon?" said a young woman with black, shining eyes
LINE 170: who was, at that moment, washing children's underclothes in a bucket.
LINE 171: She pointed her wet hand towards the open door of the adjoining room.
LINE 172: K. thought he had stepped into a meeting. A medium sized, two windowed
LINE 173: room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people--nobody paid any
LINE 174: attention to the person who had just entered. Close under its ceiling it
LINE 175: was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and where the
LINE 176: people could only stand bent down with their heads and their backs
LINE 177: touching the ceiling. K., who found the air too stuffy, stepped out
LINE 178: again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood what
LINE 179: he had said, "I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz." "Yes,"
LINE 180: said the woman, "please go on in." K. would probably not have followed
LINE 181: her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door handle
LINE 182: and said, "I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else will be
LINE 183: allowed in." "Very sensible," said K., "but it's too full already." But
LINE 184: then he went back in anyway. He passed through between two men who were
LINE 185: talking beside the door--one of them held both hands far out in front of
LINE 186: himself making the movements of counting out money, the other looked him
LINE 187: closely in the eyes--and someone took him by the hand. It was a small,
LINE 188: red-faced youth. "Come in, come in," he said. K. let himself be led by
LINE 189: him, and it turned out that there was--surprisingly in a densely packed
LINE 190: crowd of people moving to and fro--a narrow passage which may have been
LINE 191: the division between two factions; this idea was reinforced by the fact
LINE 192: that in the first few rows to the left and the right of him there was
LINE 193: hardly any face looking in his direction, he saw nothing but the backs
LINE 194: of people directing their speech and their movements only towards
LINE 195: members of their own side. Most of them were dressed in black, in old,
LINE 196: long, formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them. These
LINE 197: clothes were the only thing that puzzled K., as he would otherwise have
LINE 198: taken the whole assembly for a local political meeting.
LINE 199: At the other end of the hall where K. had been led there was a little
LINE 200: table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as overcrowded as
LINE 201: everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of the podium, sat
LINE 202: a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someone behind him. This
LINE 203: second man was standing with his legs crossed and his elbows on the
LINE 204: backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter. From time to time he
LINE 205: threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone. The youth
LINE 206: who was leading K. had some difficulty in reporting to the man. He had
LINE 207: already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tiptoe, but
LINE 208: without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him. It was
LINE 209: only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the
LINE 210: youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he
LINE 211: quietly said. Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked over at K.
LINE 212: "You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago," he said. K.
LINE 213: was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, as hardly had
LINE 214: the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the right hand
LINE 215: side of the hall. "You should have been here one hour and five minutes
LINE 216: ago," the man now repeated, raising his voice this time, and quickly
LINE 217: looked round the hall beneath him. The muttering also became immediately
LINE 218: louder and, as the man said nothing more, died away only gradually. Now
LINE 219: the hall was much quieter than when K. had entered. Only the people up
LINE 220: in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks. As far as could be
LINE 221: distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze, they seemed to be
LINE 222: less well dressed than those below. Many of them had brought pillows
LINE 223: that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would
LINE 224: not hurt themselves pressed against it.
LINE 225: K. had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not
LINE 226: defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, "Well
LINE 227: maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now." There followed loud applause,
LINE 228: once more from the right hand side of the hall. Easy people to get on
LINE 229: your side, thought K., and was bothered only by the quiet from the left
LINE 230: hand side which was directly behind him and from which there was
LINE 231: applause from only a few individuals. He wondered what he could say to
LINE 232: get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible,
LINE 233: to at least get the support of the others for a while.
LINE 234: "Yes," said the man, "but I'm now no longer under any obligation to hear
LINE 235: your case"--there was once more a muttering, but this time it was
LINE 236: misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his hand
LINE 237: and continued--"I will, however, as an exception, continue with it
LINE 238: today. But you should never arrive late like this again. And now, step
LINE 239: forward!" Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a
LINE 240: place free for K., and K. stepped up onto it. He stood pressed closely
LINE 241: against the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that
LINE 242: he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge's
LINE 243: desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it.
LINE 244: The judge, however, paid no attention to that but sat very comfortably
LINE 245: on his chair and, after saying a few words to close his discussion with
LINE 246: the man behind him, reached for a little note book, the only item on his
LINE 247: desk. It was like an old school exercise book and had become quite
LINE 248: misshapen from much thumbing. "Now then," said the judge, thumbing
LINE 249: through the book. He turned to K. with the tone of someone who knows his
LINE 250: facts and said, "you are a house painter?" "No," said K., "I am the
LINE 251: chief clerk in a large bank." This reply was followed by laughter among
LINE 252: the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty that K.
LINE 253: couldn't stop himself joining in with it. The people supported
LINE 254: themselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a
LINE 255: serious attack of coughing. Even some of those in the gallery were
LINE 256: laughing. The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power
LINE 257: over those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been
LINE 258: done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until
LINE 259: then hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and
LINE 260: bushy over his eyes.
LINE 261: The left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the people stood
LINE 262: there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium listening to
LINE 263: what was being said there, they observed the noise from the other side
LINE 264: of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some individuals
LINE 265: from their own ranks, here and there, to go forward into the other
LINE 266: faction. The people in the left faction were not only fewer in number
LINE 267: than the right but probably were no more important than them, although
LINE 268: their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they were. When K.
LINE 269: now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in the same way as
LINE 270: them.
LINE 271: "Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter--in fact
LINE 272: even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it on
LINE 273: me--is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are
LINE 274: being carried out. Perhaps you will object that there are no proceedings
LINE 275: against me. You will be quite right, as there are proceedings only if I
LINE 276: acknowledge that there are. But, for the moment, I do acknowledge it,
LINE 277: out of pity for yourselves to a large extent. It's impossible not to
LINE 278: observe all this business without feeling pity. I don't say things are
LINE 279: being done without due care but I would like to make it clear that it is
LINE 280: I who make the acknowledgement."
LINE 281: K. stopped speaking and looked down into the hall. He had spoken
LINE 282: sharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right.
LINE 283: It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but
LINE 284: everything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would
LINE 285: follow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of
LINE 286: activity that would bring this whole affair to an end. It was somewhat
LINE 287: disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the
LINE 288: young washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and,
LINE 289: despite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people
LINE 290: there. It was only the judge who gave K. any direct pleasure, as he
LINE 291: seemed to have been immediately struck by K.'s words. Until then, he had
LINE 292: listened to him standing, as K.'s speech had taken him by surprise while
LINE 293: he was directing his attention to the gallery. Now, in the pause, he sat
LINE 294: down very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice. He took out
LINE 295: the notebook again, probably so that he could give the impression of
LINE 296: being calmer.
LINE 297: "That won't help you, sir," continued K., "even your little book will
LINE 298: only confirm what I say." K. was satisfied to hear nothing but his own
LINE 299: quiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even dared casually
LINE 300: to pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it only with the
LINE 301: tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, lifted it in the
LINE 302: air, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the others on
LINE 303: each side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing, flapped down.
LINE 304: "Those are the official notes of the examining judge," he said, and let
LINE 305: the notebook fall down onto the desk. "You can read in your book as much
LINE 306: as you like, sir, I really don't have anything in this charge book to be
LINE 307: afraid of, even though I don't have access to it as I wouldn't want it
LINE 308: in my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers." The judge grabbed the
LINE 309: notebook from where it had fallen on the desk--which could only have
LINE 310: been a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that is how it must
LINE 311: have been perceived--tried to tidy it up a little, and held it once more
LINE 312: in front of himself in order to read from it.
LINE 313: The people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tension on
LINE 314: their faces that he looked back down at them for some time. Every one of
LINE 315: them was an old man, some of them with white beards. Could they perhaps
LINE 316: be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way or the
LINE 317: other. They had sunk into a state of motionlessness while K. gave his
LINE 318: oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this passivity
LINE 319: even when the judge was being humiliated. "What has happened to me,"
LINE 320: continued K., with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he continually
LINE 321: scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his address a somewhat
LINE 322: nervous and distracted character, "what has happened to me is not just
LINE 323: an isolated case. If it were it would not be of much importance as it's
LINE 324: not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of proceedings which
LINE 325: are carried out against many. It's on behalf of them that I stand here
LINE 326: now, not for myself alone."
LINE 327: Without having intended it, he had raised his voice. Somewhere in the
LINE 328: hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, "Bravo! Why
LINE 329: not then? Bravo! Again I say, Bravo!" Some of the men in the first row
LINE 330: groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to see who was
LINE 331: shouting. Not even K. thought him of any importance but it did raise his
LINE 332: spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in
LINE 333: the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began
LINE 334: to think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was
LINE 335: persuaded.
LINE 336: "I'm not trying to be a successful orator," said K. after this thought,
LINE 337: "that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway. I'm sure the examining
LINE 338: judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job after all.
LINE 339: All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong. Listen: ten
LINE 340: days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is something I
LINE 341: laugh about but that's beside the point. They came for me in the morning
LINE 342: when I was still in bed. Maybe the order had been given to arrest some
LINE 343: house painter--that seems possible after what the judge has
LINE 344: said--someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose.
LINE 345: There were two police thugs occupying the next room. They could not have
LINE 346: taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber. And these
LINE 347: policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I was sick
LINE 348: of it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving them my
LINE 349: clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring me my
LINE 350: breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front of my
LINE 351: eyes. And even that was not enough. I was led in front of the supervisor
LINE 352: in another room. This was the room of a lady who I have a lot of respect
LINE 353: for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen
LINE 354: made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any
LINE 355: fault of mine. It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed to do so and
LINE 356: was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was that I was
LINE 357: under arrest. If he were here he would have to confirm what I say. I can
LINE 358: see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I mentioned--a
LINE 359: picture of dull-witted arrogance. What do you think he answered? What
LINE 360: he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all; perhaps he really
LINE 361: did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and was satisfied. In
LINE 362: fact he had done more than that and brought three junior employees from
LINE 363: the bank where I work into the lady's room; they had made themselves
LINE 364: busy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and
LINE 365: causing a mess. There was, of course, another reason for bringing these
LINE 366: employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid, were expected to
LINE 367: spread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in
LINE 368: particular to remove me from my position at the bank. Well they didn't
LINE 369: succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my landlady, who is
LINE 370: quite a simple person--and I will give you here her name in full
LINE 371: respect, her name is Mrs. Grubach--even Mrs. Grubach was understanding
LINE 372: enough to see that an arrest like this has no more significance than an
LINE 373: attack carried out on the street by some youths who are not kept under
LINE 374: proper control. I repeat, this whole affair has caused me nothing but
LINE 375: unpleasantness and temporary irritation, but could it not also have had
LINE 376: some far worse consequences?"
LINE 377: K. broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing. As he did
LINE 378: so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give a sign
LINE 379: to someone in the crowd. K. smiled and said, "And now the judge, right
LINE 380: next to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you. There seems to
LINE 381: be someone among you who is taking directions from above. I don't know
LINE 382: whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, but I'll resist
LINE 383: trying to guess what its meaning is too soon. It really doesn't matter
LINE 384: to me, and I give his lordship the judge my full and public permission
LINE 385: to stop giving secret signs to his paid subordinate down there and give
LINE 386: his orders in words instead; let him just say 'Boo now!,' and then the
LINE 387: next time 'Clap now!'"
LINE 388: Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked backwards
LINE 389: and forwards on his seat. The man behind him, whom he had been talking
LINE 390: with earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a few general
LINE 391: words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice. Below them in
LINE 392: the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly. The two
LINE 393: factions had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to each other
LINE 394: but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed up at K.,
LINE 395: others pointed at the judge. The air in the room was fuggy and extremely
LINE 396: oppressive, those who were standing furthest away could hardly even be
LINE 397: seen through it. It must have been especially troublesome for those
LINE 398: visitors who were in the gallery, as they were forced to quietly ask
LINE 399: the participants in the assembly what exactly was happening, albeit
LINE 400: with timid glances at the judge. The replies they received were just as
LINE 401: quiet, and given behind the protection of a raised hand.
LINE 402: "I have nearly finished what I have to say," said K., and as there was
LINE 403: no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that
LINE 404: startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each
LINE 405: other. "None of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm
LINE 406: assessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real
LINE 407: importance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I
LINE 408: have to say. If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to
LINE 409: write it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll
LINE 410: soon be leaving."
LINE 411: There was immediate silence, which showed how well K. was in control of
LINE 412: the crowd. There were no shouts among them as there had been at the
LINE 413: start, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't already persuaded they
LINE 414: seemed very close to it.
LINE 415: K. was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they
LINE 416: listened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more
LINE 417: invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been. "There is
LINE 418: no doubt," he said quietly, "that there is some enormous organisation
LINE 419: determining what is said by this court. In my case this includes my
LINE 420: arrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that
LINE 421: employs policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of
LINE 422: whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as
LINE 423: some others. This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary
LINE 424: along with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all
LINE 425: the other assistance that it needs, perhaps even executioners and
LINE 426: torturers--I'm not afraid of using those words. And what, gentlemen, is
LINE 427: the purpose of this enormous organisation. Its purpose is to arrest
LINE 428: innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as
LINE 429: in my case, lead to no result. How are we to avoid those in office
LINE 430: becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning? That is
LINE 431: impossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for
LINE 432: himself. That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of
LINE 433: those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of
LINE 434: people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in
LINE 435: front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial. The policemen
LINE 436: only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those
LINE 437: they arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won
LINE 438: possessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's
LINE 439: not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers."
LINE 440: K. was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he
LINE 441: shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke
LINE 442: whitish and hard to see through. It was the washerwoman whom K. had
LINE 443: recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered.
LINE 444: It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not. K. could only
LINE 445: see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing
LINE 446: himself against her. But it was not her who was screaming, but the man,
LINE 447: he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling. A small
LINE 448: circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the
LINE 449: gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K. had introduced into
LINE 450: the gathering had been disturbed in this way. K.'s first thought was to
LINE 451: run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring
LINE 452: things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the
LINE 453: room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they were,
LINE 454: no-one moved and no-one let K. through. On the contrary, they stood in
LINE 455: his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from
LINE 456: somewhere--he did not have the time to turn round--took hold of his
LINE 457: collar. K., by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him
LINE 458: that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken
LINE 459: seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped
LINE 460: down from the podium. Now he stood face to face with the crowd. Had he
LINE 461: judged the people properly? Had he put too much faith in the effect of
LINE 462: his speech? Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had
LINE 463: been speaking, and now that he came to the end and to what must follow,
LINE 464: were they tired of pretending? What faces they were, all around him!
LINE 465: Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on
LINE 466: drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of
LINE 467: them it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if
LINE 468: they were taking hold of their own beards. But underneath those
LINE 469: beards--and this was the real discovery made by K.--there were badges of
LINE 470: various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats. As far
LINE 471: as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges. All
LINE 472: of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be
LINE 473: divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned
LINE 474: round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who
LINE 475: calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap. "So," called out
LINE 476: K., throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed
LINE 477: more room, "all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that
LINE 478: you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I've just been speaking
LINE 479: about, you've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and
LINE 480: snoop on me, you gave the impression of having formed into factions, one
LINE 481: of you even applauded me to test me out, and you wanted to learn how to
LINE 482: trap an innocent man! Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing, I
LINE 483: hope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend
LINE 484: his innocence or else--let go of me or I'll hit you," shouted K. to a
LINE 485: quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him--"or
LINE 486: else that you've actually learned something. And so I wish you good luck
LINE 487: in your trade." He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of
LINE 488: the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the
LINE 489: completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit. However, the
LINE 490: examining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K., as he was
LINE 491: waiting for him at the doorway. "One moment," he said. K. stood where he
LINE 492: was, but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather
LINE 493: than at the judge. "I merely wanted to draw your attention," said the
LINE 494: judge, "to something you seem not yet to be aware of: today, you have
LINE 495: robbed yourself of the advantages that a hearing of this sort always
LINE 496: gives to someone who is under arrest." K. laughed towards the door. "You
LINE 497: bunch of louts," he called, "you can keep all your hearings as a present
LINE 498: from me," then opened the door and hurried down the steps. Behind him,
LINE 499: the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and
LINE 500: probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study
LINE 501: of them.
