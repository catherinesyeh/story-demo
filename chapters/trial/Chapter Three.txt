LINE 1: In the empty Courtroom--The Student--The Offices
LINE 2: Every day over the following week, K. expected another summons to
LINE 3: arrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had
LINE 4: been taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come
LINE 5: by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without
LINE 6: being told, to appear at the same place at the same time. So on Sunday,
LINE 7: he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up
LINE 8: the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him
LINE 9: and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask
LINE 10: anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door. It was opened as soon
LINE 11: as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen last
LINE 12: time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight into
LINE 13: the adjoining room when she said to him "There's no session today."
LINE 14: "What do you mean; no session?" he asked, unable to believe it. But the
LINE 15: woman persuaded him by opening the door to the next room. It was indeed
LINE 16: empty, and looked even more dismal empty than it had the previous
LINE 17: Sunday. On the podium stood the table exactly as it had been before with
LINE 18: a few books laying on it. "Can I have a look at those books?" asked K.,
LINE 19: not because he was especially curious but so that he would not have come
LINE 20: for nothing. "No," said the woman as she re-closed the door, "that's not
LINE 21: allowed. Those books belong to the examining judge." "I see," said K.,
LINE 22: and nodded, "those books must be law books, and that's how this court
LINE 23: does things, not only to try people who are innocent but even to try
LINE 24: them without letting them know what's going on." "I expect you're
LINE 25: right," said the woman, who had not understood exactly what he meant.
LINE 26: "I'd better go away again, then," said K. "Should I give a message to
LINE 27: the examining judge?" asked the woman. "Do you know him, then?" asked K.
LINE 28: "Of course I know him," said the woman, "my husband is the court usher."
LINE 29: It was only now that K. noticed that the room, which before had held
LINE 30: nothing but a wash-tub, had been fitted out as a living room. The woman
LINE 31: saw how surprised he was and said, "Yes, we're allowed to live here as
LINE 32: we like, only we have to clear the room out when the court's in session.
LINE 33: There's lots of disadvantages to my husband's job." "It's not so much
LINE 34: the room that surprises me," said K., looking at her crossly, "it's your
LINE 35: being married that shocks me." "Are you thinking about what happened
LINE 36: last time the court was in session, when I disturbed what you were
LINE 37: saying?" asked the woman. "Of course," said K., "it's in the past now
LINE 38: and I've nearly forgotten about it, but at the time it made me furious.
LINE 39: And now you tell me yourself that you are a married woman." "It wasn't
LINE 40: any disadvantage for you to have your speech interrupted. The way they
LINE 41: talked about you after you'd gone was really bad." "That could well be,"
LINE 42: said K., turning away, "but it does not excuse you." "There's no-one I
LINE 43: know who'd hold it against me," said the woman. "Him, who put his arms
LINE 44: around me, he's been chasing after me for a long time. I might not be
LINE 45: very attractive for most people, but I am for him. I've got no
LINE 46: protection from him, even my husband has had to get used to it; if he
LINE 47: wants to keep his job he's got to put up with it as that man's a student
LINE 48: and he'll almost certainly be very powerful later on. He's always after
LINE 49: me, he'd only just left when you arrived." "That fits in with everything
LINE 50: else," said K., "I'm not surprised." "Do you want to make things a bit
LINE 51: better here?" the woman asked slowly, watching him as if she were saying
LINE 52: something that could be as dangerous for K. as for herself. "That's what
LINE 53: I thought when I heard you speak, I really liked what you said. Mind
LINE 54: you, I only heard part of it, I missed the beginning of it and at the
LINE 55: end I was lying on the floor with the student--it's so horrible here,"
LINE 56: she said after a pause, and took hold of K.'s hand. "Do you believe you
LINE 57: really will be able to make things better?" K. smiled and twisted his
LINE 58: hand round a little in her soft hands. "It's really not my job to make
LINE 59: things better here, as you put it," he said, "and if you said that to
LINE 60: the examining judge he would laugh at you or punish you for it. I really
LINE 61: would not have become involved in this matter if I could have helped it,
LINE 62: and I would have lost no sleep worrying about how this court needs to be
LINE 63: made better. But because I'm told that I have been arrested--and I am
LINE 64: under arrest--it forces me to take some action, and to do so for my own
LINE 65: sake. However, if I can be of some service to you in the process I will,
LINE 66: of course, be glad to do so. And I will be glad to do so not only for
LINE 67: the sake of charity but also because you can be of some help to me."
LINE 68: "How could I help you, then?" said the woman. "You could, for example,
LINE 69: show me the books on the table there." "Yes, certainly," the woman
LINE 70: cried, and pulled K. along behind her as she rushed to them. The books
LINE 71: were old and well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken
LINE 72: through in its middle, and it was held together with a few threads.
LINE 73: "Everything is so dirty here," said K., shaking his head, and before he
LINE 74: could pick the books up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her
LINE 75: apron. K. took hold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an
LINE 76: indecent picture appeared. A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the
LINE 77: base intent of whoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so
LINE 78: grossly lacking in skill that all that anyone could really make out were
LINE 79: the man and the woman who dominated the picture with their bodies,
LINE 80: sitting in overly upright postures that created a false perspective and
LINE 81: made it difficult for them to approach each other. K. didn't thumb
LINE 82: through that book any more, but just threw open the next one at its
LINE 83: title page, it was a novel with the title, What Grete Suffered from her
LINE 84: Husband, Hans. "So this is the sort of law book they study here," said
LINE 85: K., "this is the sort of person sitting in judgement over me." "I can
LINE 86: help you," said the woman, "would you like me to?" "Could you really do
LINE 87: that without placing yourself in danger? You did say earlier on that
LINE 88: your husband is wholly dependent on his superiors." "I still want to
LINE 89: help you," said the woman, "come over here, we've got to talk about it.
LINE 90: Don't say any more about what danger I'm in, I only fear danger where I
LINE 91: want to fear it. Come over here." She pointed to the podium and invited
LINE 92: him to sit down on the step with her. "You've got lovely dark eyes," she
LINE 93: said after they had sat down, looking up into K.'s face, "people say
LINE 94: I've got nice eyes too, but yours are much nicer. It was the first thing
LINE 95: I noticed when you first came here. That's even why I came in here, into
LINE 96: the assembly room, afterwards, I'd never normally do that, I'm not
LINE 97: really even allowed to." So that's what all this is about, thought K.,
LINE 98: she's offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else
LINE 99: around here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is
LINE 100: understandable I suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes
LINE 101: compliments about his eyes. With that, K. stood up in silence as if he
LINE 102: had spoken his thoughts out loud and thus explained his action to the
LINE 103: woman. "I don't think you can be of any assistance to me," he said, "to
LINE 104: be of any real assistance you would need to be in contact with high
LINE 105: officials. But I'm sure you only know the lower employees, and there are
LINE 106: crowds of them milling about here. I'm sure you're very familiar with
LINE 107: them and could achieve a great deal through them, I've no doubt of that,
LINE 108: but the most that could be done through them would have no bearing at
LINE 109: all on the final outcome of the trial. You, on the other hand, would
LINE 110: lose some of your friends as a result, and I have no wish of that. Carry
LINE 111: on with these people in the same way as you have been, as it does seem
LINE 112: to me to be something you cannot do without. I have no regrets in saying
LINE 113: this as, in return for your compliment to me, I also find you rather
LINE 114: attractive, especially when you look at me as sadly as you are now,
LINE 115: although you really have no reason to do so. You belong to the people I
LINE 116: have to combat, and you're very comfortable among them, you're even in
LINE 117: love with the student, or if you don't love him you do at least prefer
LINE 118: him to your husband. It's easy to see that from what you've been
LINE 119: saying." "No!" she shouted, remained sitting where she was and grasped
LINE 120: K.'s hand, which he failed to pull away fast enough. "You can't go away
LINE 121: now, you can't go away when you've misjudged me like that! Are you
LINE 122: really capable of going away now? Am I really so worthless that you
LINE 123: won't even do me the favour of staying a little bit longer?" "You
LINE 124: misunderstand me," said K., sitting back down, "if it's really important
LINE 125: to you for me to stay here then I'll be glad to do so, I have plenty of
LINE 126: time, I came here thinking there would be a trial taking place. All I
LINE 127: meant with what I said just now was to ask you not to do anything on my
LINE 128: behalf in the proceedings against me. But even that is nothing for you
LINE 129: to worry about when you consider that there's nothing hanging on the
LINE 130: outcome of this trial, and that, whatever the verdict, I will just laugh
LINE 131: at it. And that's even presupposing it ever even reaches any conclusion,
LINE 132: which I very much doubt. I think it's much more likely that the court
LINE 133: officials will be too lazy, too forgetful, or even too fearful ever to
LINE 134: continue with these proceedings and that they will soon be abandoned if
LINE 135: they haven't been abandoned already. It's even possible that they will
LINE 136: pretend to be carrying on with the trial in the hope of receiving a
LINE 137: large bribe, although I can tell you now that that will be quite in vain
LINE 138: as I pay bribes to no-one. Perhaps one favour you could do me would be
LINE 139: to tell the examining judge, or anyone else who likes to spread
LINE 140: important news, that I will never be induced to pay any sort of bribe
LINE 141: through any stratagem of theirs--and I'm sure they have many stratagems
LINE 142: at their disposal. There is no prospect of that, you can tell them that
LINE 143: quite openly. And what's more, I expect they have already noticed
LINE 144: themselves, or even if they haven't, this affair is really not so
LINE 145: important to me as they think. Those gentlemen would only save some work
LINE 146: for themselves, or at least some unpleasantness for me, which, however,
LINE 147: I am glad to endure if I know that each piece of unpleasantness for me
LINE 148: is a blow against them. And I will make quite sure it is a blow against
LINE 149: them. Do you actually know the judge?" "Course I do," said the woman,
LINE 150: "he was the first one I thought of when I offered to help you. I didn't
LINE 151: know he's only a minor official, but if you say so it must be true. Mind
LINE 152: you, I still think the report he gives to his superiors must have some
LINE 153: influence. And he writes so many reports. You say these officials are
LINE 154: lazy, but they're certainly not all lazy, especially this examining
LINE 155: judge, he writes ever such a lot. Last Sunday, for instance, that
LINE 156: session went on till the evening. Everyone had gone, but the examining
LINE 157: judge, he stayed in the hall, I had to bring him a lamp in, all I had
LINE 158: was a little kitchen lamp but he was very satisfied with it and started
LINE 159: to write straight away. Meantime my husband arrived, he always has the
LINE 160: day off on Sundays, we got the furniture back in and got our room sorted
LINE 161: out and then a few of the neighbours came, we sat and talked for a bit
LINE 162: by a candle, in short, we forgot all about the examining judge and went
LINE 163: to bed. All of a sudden in the night, it must have been quite late in
LINE 164: the night, I wakes up, next to the bed, there's the examining judge
LINE 165: shading the lamp with his hand so that there's no light from it falls on
LINE 166: my husband, he didn't need to be as careful as that, the way my husband
LINE 167: sleeps the light wouldn't have woken him up anyway. I was quite shocked
LINE 168: and nearly screamed, but the judge was very friendly, warned me I should
LINE 169: be careful, he whispered to me he's been writing all this time, and now
LINE 170: he's brought me the lamp back, and he'll never forget how I looked when
LINE 171: he found me there asleep. What I mean, with all this, I just wanted to
LINE 172: tell you how the examining judge really does write lots of reports,
LINE 173: especially about you as questioning you was definitely one of the main
LINE 174: things on the agenda that Sunday. If he writes reports as long as that
LINE 175: they must be of some importance. And besides all that, you can see from
LINE 176: what happened that the examining judge is after me, and it's right now,
LINE 177: when he's first begun to notice me, that I can have a lot of influence
LINE 178: on him. And I've got other proof I mean a lot to him, too. Yesterday, he
LINE 179: sent that student to me, the one he really trusts and who he works with,
LINE 180: he sent him with a present for me, silk stockings. He said it was
LINE 181: because I clear up in the courtroom but that's only a pretence, that
LINE 182: job's no more than what I'm supposed to do, it's what my husband gets
LINE 183: paid for. Nice stockings, they are, look,"--she stretched out her leg,
LINE 184: drew her skirt up to her knee and looked, herself, at the
LINE 185: stocking--"they are nice stockings, but they're too good for me,
LINE 186: really."
LINE 187: She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K.'s as if she
LINE 188: wanted to calm him down, and whispered, "Be quiet, Berthold is watching
LINE 189: us." K. slowly looked up. In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young
LINE 190: man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and he continually
LINE 191: moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with which he hoped
LINE 192: to make himself look dignified. K. looked at him with some curiosity, he
LINE 193: was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of
LINE 194: jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely
LINE 195: attain high office one day. The student, in contrast, seemed to take no
LINE 196: notice of K. at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long
LINE 197: enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman
LINE 198: leant over to K. and whispered, "Don't be cross with me, please don't,
LINE 199: and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to
LINE 200: this horrible man, just look at his bent legs. But I'll come straight
LINE 201: back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you
LINE 202: want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be happy if I can be
LINE 203: away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away
LINE 204: from here for good." She stroked K.'s hand once more, jumped up and ran
LINE 205: over to the window. Before he realised it, K. grasped for her hand but
LINE 206: failed to catch it. He really was attracted to the woman, and even after
LINE 207: thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give
LINE 208: in to her allure. It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to
LINE 209: entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no
LINE 210: difficulty in fending off. In what way could she entrap him? Was he not
LINE 211: still free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he
LINE 212: wanted, at least where it concerned him? Could he not have that much
LINE 213: confidence in himself? And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe
LINE 214: it wasn't quite worthless. And maybe there was no better revenge against
LINE 215: the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and
LINE 216: have her for himself. Maybe then, after much hard work writing dishonest
LINE 217: reports about K., the judge would go to the woman's bed late one night
LINE 218: and find it empty. And it would be empty because she belonged to K.,
LINE 219: because this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its
LINE 220: sombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him
LINE 221: and to him alone. Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in
LINE 222: this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was
LINE 223: taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then
LINE 224: even with his fist. The student briefly looked away from the woman to
LINE 225: glance at K. over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in
LINE 226: fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around
LINE 227: her. She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as
LINE 228: she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting
LINE 229: what he was saying. K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the
LINE 230: student held over the woman and which she had already complained about,
LINE 231: he stood up and walked up and down the room. Glancing sideways at the
LINE 232: student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid
LINE 233: of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly
LINE 234: disturbed by K.'s to-ing and fro-ing which K. had now developed into a
LINE 235: stamping up and down, said to him, "You don't have to stay here, you
LINE 236: know, if you're getting impatient. You could have gone earlier, no-one
LINE 237: would have missed you. In fact you should have gone, you should have
LINE 238: left as quickly as possible as soon as I got here." This comment could
LINE 239: have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K. also
LINE 240: bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a
LINE 241: disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in
LINE 242: speaking in this way. K. remained standing quite close to him and said
LINE 243: with a smile, "You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way
LINE 244: to settle this impatience would be if you left us. On the other hand,
LINE 245: if you've come here to study--you are a student, I hear--I'll be quite
LINE 246: happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman. I'm sure
LINE 247: you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge.
LINE 248: It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of
LINE 249: jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking
LINE 250: roughly--and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well." "He
LINE 251: shouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely," said the student,
LINE 252: as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K.'s insults, "that
LINE 253: was a mistake. I've told the examining judge so. He should at least have
LINE 254: been detained in his room between hearings. Sometimes it's impossible to
LINE 255: understand what the judge thinks he's doing." "You're wasting your
LINE 256: breath," said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and
LINE 257: said, "come with me." "So that's it," said the student, "oh no, you're
LINE 258: not going to get her," and with a strength you would not have expected
LINE 259: from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his
LINE 260: back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door. In this way he
LINE 261: showed, unmistakably, that he was to some extent afraid of K., but he
LINE 262: nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing
LINE 263: the woman's arm with his free hand. K. ran the few steps up to him, but
LINE 264: when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if
LINE 265: necessary, throttle him, the woman said, "It's no good, it's the
LINE 266: examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little
LINE 267: bastard ..." and here she ran her hand over the student's face, "this
LINE 268: little bastard won't let me." "And you don't want to be set free!"
LINE 269: shouted K., laying his hand on the student's shoulder, who then snapped
LINE 270: at it with his teeth. "No!" shouted the woman, pushing K. away with both
LINE 271: hands, "no, no don't do that, what d'you think you're doing? That'd be
LINE 272: the end of me. Let go of him, please just let go of him. He's only
LINE 273: carrying out the judge's orders, he's carrying me to him." "Let him take
LINE 274: you then, and I want to see nothing more of you," said K., enraged by
LINE 275: his disappointment and giving the student a thump in the back so that he
LINE 276: briefly stumbled and then, glad that he had not fallen, immediately
LINE 277: jumped up all the higher with his burden. K. followed them slowly. He
LINE 278: realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered
LINE 279: from these people. It was of course nothing to worry about, he accepted
LINE 280: the setback only because he was looking for a fight. If he stayed at
LINE 281: home and carried on with his normal life he would be a thousand times
LINE 282: superior to these people and could get any of them out of his way just
LINE 283: with a kick. And he imagined the most laughable scene possible as an
LINE 284: example of this, if this contemptible student, this inflated child, this
LINE 285: knock-kneed redbeard, if he were kneeling at Elsa's bed wringing his
LINE 286: hands and begging for forgiveness. K. so enjoyed imagining this scene
LINE 287: that he decided to take the student along to Elsa with him if ever he
LINE 288: should get the opportunity.
LINE 289: K. was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over
LINE 290: to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets
LINE 291: on his arm. It turned out that the journey was far shorter. Directly
LINE 292: opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which
LINE 293: probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was
LINE 294: not possible to see where they ended. The student carried the woman up
LINE 295: these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon
LINE 296: groaning and moving very slowly. The woman waved down at K. and by
LINE 297: raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an
LINE 298: innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a
LINE 299: lot of regret. K. watched her without expression like a stranger, he
LINE 300: wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily
LINE 301: get over his disappointment.
LINE 302: The two of them had disappeared, but K. remained standing in the
LINE 303: doorway. He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but
LINE 304: that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the
LINE 305: examining judge. The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and
LINE 306: waiting in the attic. The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him
LINE 307: however long he stared at them. Then K. noticed a small piece of paper
LINE 308: next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised
LINE 309: hand, "Entrance to the Court Offices". Were the court offices here, in
LINE 310: the attic of this tenement, then? If that was how they were
LINE 311: accommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort
LINE 312: for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its
LINE 313: disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of
LINE 314: the building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would
LINE 315: throw their unneeded junk. On the other hand, it was possible that the
LINE 316: officials had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves
LINE 317: rather than use it for the court's purposes. Going by K.'s experience of
LINE 318: them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were
LINE 319: allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but
LINE 320: also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply in a
LINE 321: state of poverty. K. also now understood that the court was ashamed to
LINE 322: summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial
LINE 323: hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes.
LINE 324: What a position it was that K. found himself in, compared with the judge
LINE 325: sitting up in the attic! K., at the bank, had a big office with an
LINE 326: ante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down
LINE 327: at the activity in the square. It was true, though, that he had no
LINE 328: secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant
LINE 329: to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm. K., however, was quite
LINE 330: willing to do without such things, in this life at least. K. was still
LINE 331: looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked through the
LINE 332: open door into the living room where it was also possible to see the
LINE 333: courtroom, and finally asked K. whether he had just seen a woman there.
LINE 334: "You're the court usher, aren't you?" asked K. "That's right," said the
LINE 335: man, "oh, yes, you're defendant K., I recognise you now as well. Nice to
LINE 336: see you here." And he offered K. his hand, which was far from what K.
LINE 337: had expected. And when K. said nothing, he added, "There's no court
LINE 338: session planned for today, though." "I know that," said K. as he looked
LINE 339: at the usher's civilian coat which, beside its ordinary buttons,
LINE 340: displayed two gilded ones as the only sign of his office and seemed to
LINE 341: have been taken from an old army officer's coat. "I was speaking with
LINE 342: your wife a little while ago. She is no longer here. The student has
LINE 343: carried her off to the examining judge." "Listen to this," said the
LINE 344: usher, "they're always carrying her away from me. It's Sunday today, and
LINE 345: it's not part of my job to do any work today, but they send me off with
LINE 346: some message which isn't even necessary just to get me away from here.
LINE 347: What they do is they send me off not too far away so that I can still
LINE 348: hope to get back on time if I really hurry. So off I go running as fast
LINE 349: as I can, shout the message through the crack in the door of the office
LINE 350: I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be able to understand
LINE 351: it, run back here again, but the student's been even faster than I
LINE 352: have--well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run down the steps.
LINE 353: If I wasn't so dependent on them I'd have squashed the student against
LINE 354: the wall here a long time ago. Right here, next to the sign. I'm always
LINE 355: dreaming of doing that. Just here, just above the floor, that's where
LINE 356: he's crushed onto the wall, his arms stretched out, his fingers spread
LINE 357: apart, his crooked legs twisted round into a circle and blood squirted
LINE 358: out all around him. It's only ever been a dream so far, though." "Is
LINE 359: there nothing else you do?" asked K. with a smile. "Nothing that I know
LINE 360: of," said the usher. "And it's going to get even worse now, up till now
LINE 361: he's only been carrying her off for himself, now he's started carrying
LINE 362: her off for the judge and all, just like I'd always said he would."
LINE 363: "Does your wife, then, not share some of the responsibility?" asked K.
LINE 364: He had to force himself as he asked this question, as he, too, felt so
LINE 365: jealous now. "Course she does," said the usher, "it's more her fault
LINE 366: than theirs. It was her who attached herself to him. All he did, he just
LINE 367: chases after any woman. There's five flats in this block alone where
LINE 368: he's been thrown out after working his way in there. And my wife is the
LINE 369: best looking woman in the whole building, but it's me who's not even
LINE 370: allowed to defend himself." "If that's how things are, then there's
LINE 371: nothing that can be done," said K. "Well why not?" asked the usher.
LINE 372: "He's a coward that student, if he wants to lay a finger on my wife all
LINE 373: you'd have to do is give him such a good hiding he'd never dare do it
LINE 374: again. But I'm not allowed to do that, and nobody else is going to do me
LINE 375: the favour as they're all afraid of his power. The only one who could do
LINE 376: it is a man like you." "What, how could I do it?" asked K. in
LINE 377: astonishment. "Well you're facing a charge, aren't you," said the usher.
LINE 378: "Yes, but that's all the more reason for me to be afraid. Even if he has
LINE 379: no influence on the outcome of the trial he probably has some on the
LINE 380: initial examination." "Yes, exactly," said the usher, as if K.'s view
LINE 381: had been just as correct as his own. "Only we don't usually get any
LINE 382: trials heard here with no hope at all." "I am not of the same opinion,"
LINE 383: said K., "although that ought not to prevent me from dealing with the
LINE 384: student if the opportunity arises." "I would be very grateful to you,"
LINE 385: said the usher of the court, somewhat formally, not really seeming to
LINE 386: believe that his highest wish could be fulfilled. "Perhaps," continued
LINE 387: K., "perhaps there are some other officials of yours here, perhaps all
LINE 388: of them, who would deserve the same." "Oh yes, yes," said the usher, as
LINE 389: if this was a matter of course. Then he looked at K. trustingly which,
LINE 390: despite all his friendliness, he had not done until then, and added,
LINE 391: "they're always rebelling." But the conversation seemed to have become a
LINE 392: little uncomfortable for him, as he broke it off by saying, "now I have
LINE 393: to report to the office. Would you like to come with me?" "There's
LINE 394: nothing for me to do there," said K. "You'd be able to have a look at
LINE 395: it. No-one will take any notice of you." "Is it worth seeing then?"
LINE 396: asked K. hesitatingly, although he felt very keen to go with him.
LINE 397: "Well," said the usher, "I thought you'd be interested in it." "Alright
LINE 398: then," said K. finally, "I'll come with you." And, quicker than the
LINE 399: usher himself, he ran up the steps.
LINE 400: At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was
LINE 401: another step. "They don't show much concern for the public," he said.
LINE 402: "They don't show any concern at all," said the usher, "just look at the
LINE 403: waiting room here." It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly
LINE 404: made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic. There was
LINE 405: no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the
LINE 406: departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to
LINE 407: the ceiling to separate them from the corridor. The light made its way
LINE 408: in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials
LINE 409: through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the
LINE 410: wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the
LINE 411: gaps. There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it
LINE 412: was Sunday. They were not very impressive. They sat, equally spaced, on
LINE 413: two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides
LINE 414: of the corridor. All of them were carelessly dressed although the
LINE 415: expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and
LINE 416: many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to
LINE 417: the upper classes. There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they
LINE 418: had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the
LINE 419: example of the others. When those who were sitting nearest the door saw
LINE 420: K. and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the
LINE 421: others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as
LINE 422: the two of them went by all the people there stood up. None of them
LINE 423: stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they
LINE 424: stood like beggars on the street. K. waited for the usher, who was
LINE 425: following just behind him. "They must all be very dispirited," he said.
LINE 426: "Yes," said the usher, "they are the accused, everyone you see here has
LINE 427: been accused." "Really!" said K. "They're colleagues of mine then." And
LINE 428: he turned to the nearest one, a tall, thin man with hair that was nearly
LINE 429: grey. "What is it you are waiting for here?" asked K., politely, but the
LINE 430: man was startled at being spoken to unexpectedly, which was all the more
LINE 431: pitiful to see because the man clearly had some experience of the world
LINE 432: and elsewhere would certainly have been able to show his superiority and
LINE 433: would not have easily given up the advantage he had acquired. Here,
LINE 434: though, he did not know what answer to give to such a simple question
LINE 435: and looked round at the others as if they were under some obligation to
LINE 436: help him, and as if no-one could expect any answer from him without this
LINE 437: help. Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order
LINE 438: to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, "The gentleman here's only
LINE 439: asking what it is you're waiting for. You can give him an answer." The
LINE 440: voice of the usher was probably familiar to him, and had a better effect
LINE 441: than K.'s. "I'm ... I'm waiting...." he began, and then came to a halt.
LINE 442: He had clearly chosen this beginning so that he could give a precise
LINE 443: answer to the question, but now he didn't know how to continue. Some of
LINE 444: the others waiting had come closer and stood round the group, the usher
LINE 445: of the court said to them, "Get out the way, keep the gangway free."
LINE 446: They moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting
LINE 447: before. In the meantime, the man whom K. had first approached had pulled
LINE 448: himself together and even answered him with a smile. "A month ago I made
LINE 449: some applications for evidence to be heard in my case, and I'm waiting
LINE 450: for it to be settled." "You certainly seem to be going to a lot of
LINE 451: effort," said K. "Yes," said the man, "it is my affair after all." "Not
LINE 452: everyone thinks the same way as you do," said K. "I've been indicted as
LINE 453: well but I swear on my soul that I've neither submitted evidence nor
LINE 454: done anything else of the sort. Do you really think that's necessary?"
LINE 455: "I don't really know, exactly," said the man, once more totally unsure
LINE 456: of himself; he clearly thought K. was joking with him and therefore
LINE 457: probably thought it best to repeat his earlier answer in order to avoid
LINE 458: making any new mistakes. With K. looking at him impatiently, he just
LINE 459: said, "as far as I'm concerned, I've applied to have this evidence
LINE 460: heard." "Perhaps you don't believe I've been indicted?" asked K. "Oh,
LINE 461: please, I certainly do," said the man, stepping slightly to one side,
LINE 462: but there was more anxiety in his answer than belief. "You don't believe
LINE 463: me then?" asked K., and took hold of his arm, unconsciously prompted by
LINE 464: the man's humble demeanour, and as if he wanted to force him to believe
LINE 465: him. But he did not want to hurt the man and had only taken hold of him
LINE 466: very lightly. Nonetheless, the man cried out as if K. had grasped him
LINE 467: not with two fingers but with red hot tongs. Shouting in this ridiculous
LINE 468: way finally made K. tired of him, if he didn't believe he was indicted
LINE 469: then so much the better; maybe he even thought K. was a judge. And
LINE 470: before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench
LINE 471: and walked on. "These defendants are so sensitive, most of them," said
LINE 472: the usher of the court. Almost all of those who had been waiting had now
LINE 473: assembled around the man who, by now, had stopped shouting and they
LINE 474: seemed to be asking him lots of precise questions about the incident. K.
LINE 475: was approached by a security guard, identifiable mainly by his sword, of
LINE 476: which the scabbard seemed to be made of aluminium. This greatly
LINE 477: surprised K., and he reached out for it with his hand. The guard had
LINE 478: come because of the shouting and asked what had been happening. The
LINE 479: usher of the court said a few words to try and calm him down but the
LINE 480: guard explained that he had to look into it himself, saluted, and
LINE 481: hurried on, walking with very short steps, probably because of gout.
LINE 482: K. didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people,
LINE 483: especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along
LINE 484: it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going
LINE 485: that way. He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the
LINE 486: usher nodded, and that is the way that K. went. The usher remained
LINE 487: always one or two steps behind K., which he found irritating as in a
LINE 488: place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven
LINE 489: along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the
LINE 490: usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him. In order to
LINE 491: put an end to his discomfort, K. finally said, "Now that I've seen what
LINE 492: it looks like here, I'd like to go." "You haven't seen everything yet,"
LINE 493: said the usher ingenuously. "I don't want to see everything," said K.,
LINE 494: who was also feeling very tired, "I want to go, what is the way to the
LINE 495: exit?" "You haven't got lost, have you?" asked the usher in amazement,
LINE 496: "you go down this way to the corner, then right down the corridor
LINE 497: straight ahead as far as the door." "Come with me," said K., "show me
LINE 498: the way, I'll miss it, there are so many different ways here." "It's the
LINE 499: only way there is," said the usher, who had now started to sound quite
LINE 500: reproachful, "I can't go back with you again, I've got to hand in my
LINE 501: report, and I've already lost a lot of time because of you as it is."
LINE 502: "Come with me!" K. repeated, now somewhat sharper as if he had finally
LINE 503: caught the usher out in a lie. "Don't shout like that," whispered the
LINE 504: usher, "there's offices all round us here. If you don't want to go back
LINE 505: by yourself come on a bit further with me or else wait here till I've
LINE 506: sorted out my report, then I'll be glad to go back with you again." "No,
LINE 507: no," said K., "I will not wait and you must come with me now." K. had
LINE 508: still not looked round at anything at all in the room where he found
LINE 509: himself, and it was only when one of the many wooden doors all around
LINE 510: him opened that he noticed it. A young woman, probably summoned by the
LINE 511: loudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, "What is it the gentleman
LINE 512: wants?" In the darkness behind her there was also a man approaching. K.
LINE 513: looked at the usher. He had, after all, said that no-one would take any
LINE 514: notice of K., and now there were two people coming, it only needed a few
LINE 515: and everyone in the office would become aware of him and asking for
LINE 516: explanations as to why he was there. The only understandable and
LINE 517: acceptable thing to say was that he was accused of something and wanted
LINE 518: to know the date of his next hearing, but this was an explanation he did
LINE 519: not want to give, especially as it was not true--he had only come out of
LINE 520: curiosity. Or else, an explanation even less usable, he could say that
LINE 521: he wanted to ascertain that the court was as revolting on the inside as
LINE 522: it was on the outside. And it did seem that he had been quite right in
LINE 523: this supposition, he had no wish to intrude any deeper, he was disturbed
LINE 524: enough by what he had seen already, he was not in the right frame of
LINE 525: mind just then to face a high official such as might appear from behind
LINE 526: any door, and he wanted to go, either with the usher of the court or, if
LINE 527: needs be, alone.
LINE 528: But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the
LINE 529: young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought
LINE 530: he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they
LINE 531: didn't want to miss seeing. And in the doorway stood the man whom K. had
LINE 532: noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above
LINE 533: the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming
LINE 534: impatient as he watched. But the young woman was the first to recognise
LINE 535: that K.'s behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she
LINE 536: brought a chair and asked, "Would you not like to sit down?" K. sat down
LINE 537: immediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on
LINE 538: the armrests. "You're a little bit dizzy, aren't you?" she asked him.
LINE 539: Her face was now close in front of him, it bore the severe expression
LINE 540: that many young women have just when they're in the bloom of their
LINE 541: youth. "It's nothing for you to worry about," she said, "that's nothing
LINE 542: unusual here, almost everyone gets an attack like that the first time
LINE 543: they come here. This is your first time is it. Yes, it's nothing unusual
LINE 544: then. The sun burns down on the roof and the hot wood makes the air so
LINE 545: thick and heavy. It makes this place rather unsuitable for offices,
LINE 546: whatever other advantages it might offer. But the air is almost
LINE 547: impossible to breathe on days when there's a lot of business, and that's
LINE 548: almost every day. And when you think that there's a lot of washing put
LINE 549: out to dry here as well--and we can't stop the tenants doing that--it's
LINE 550: not surprising you started to feel unwell. But you get used to the air
LINE 551: alright in the end. When you're here for the second or third time you'll
LINE 552: hardly notice how oppressive the air is. Are you feeling any better
LINE 553: now?" K. made no answer, he felt too embarrassed at being put at the
LINE 554: mercy of these people by his sudden weakness, and learning the reason
LINE 555: for feeling ill made him feel not better but a little worse. The girl
LINE 556: noticed it straight away, and to make the air fresher for K., she took a
LINE 557: window pole that was leaning against the wall and pushed open a small
LINE 558: hatch directly above K.'s head that led to the outside. But so much soot
LINE 559: fell in that the girl had to immediately close the hatch again and clean
LINE 560: the soot off K.'s hands with her handkerchief, as K. was too tired to do
LINE 561: that for himself. He would have liked just to sit quietly where he was
LINE 562: until he had enough strength to leave, and the less fuss people made
LINE 563: about him the sooner that would be. But then the girl said, "You can't
LINE 564: stay here, we're in people's way here...." K. looked at her as if to ask
LINE 565: whose way they were impeding. "If you like, I can take you to the sick
LINE 566: room," and turning to the man in the doorway said, "please help me." The
LINE 567: man immediately came over to them, but K. did not want to go to the sick
LINE 568: room, that was just what he wanted to avoid, being led further from
LINE 569: place to place, the further he went the more difficult it must become.
LINE 570: So he said, "I am able to walk now," and stood up, shaking after
LINE 571: becoming used to sitting so comfortably. But then he was unable to stay
LINE 572: upright. "I can't manage it," he said shaking his head, and sat down
LINE 573: again with a sigh. He remembered the usher who, despite everything,
LINE 574: would have been able to lead him out of there but who seemed to have
LINE 575: gone long before. K. looked out between the man and the young woman who
LINE 576: were standing in front of him but was unable to find the usher. "I
LINE 577: think," said the man, who was elegantly dressed and whose appearance was
LINE 578: made especially impressive with a grey waistcoat that had two long,
LINE 579: sharply tailored points, "the gentleman is feeling unwell because of the
LINE 580: atmosphere here, so the best thing, and what he would most prefer, would
LINE 581: be not to take him to the sick room but get him out of the offices
LINE 582: altogether." "That's right," exclaimed K., with such joy that he nearly
LINE 583: interrupted what the man was saying, "I'm sure that'll make me feel
LINE 584: better straight away, I'm really not that weak, all I need is a little
LINE 585: support under my arms, I won't cause you much trouble, it's not such a
LINE 586: long way anyway, lead me to the door and then I'll sit on the stairs for
LINE 587: a while and soon recover, as I don't suffer from attacks like this at
LINE 588: all, I'm surprised at it myself. I also work in an office and I'm quite
LINE 589: used to office air, but here it seems to be too strong, you've said so
LINE 590: yourselves. So please, be so kind as to help me on my way a little, I'm
LINE 591: feeling dizzy, you see, and it'll make me ill if I stand up by myself."
LINE 592: And with that he raised his shoulders to make it easier for the two of
LINE 593: them to take him by the arms.
LINE 594: The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there
LINE 595: with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud. "There, you
LINE 596: see," he said to the girl, "I was quite right. The gentleman is only
LINE 597: unwell here, and not in general." The young woman smiled too, but
LINE 598: lightly tapped the man's arm with the tips of her fingers as if he had
LINE 599: allowed himself too much fun with K. "So what do you think, then?" said
LINE 600: the man, still laughing, "I really do want to lead the gentleman out of
LINE 601: here." "That's alright, then," said the girl, briefly inclining her
LINE 602: charming head. "Don't worry too much about him laughing," said the girl
LINE 603: to K., who had become unhappy once more and stared quietly in front of
LINE 604: himself as if needing no further explanation. "This gentleman--may I
LINE 605: introduce you?"--(the man gave his permission with a wave of the
LINE 606: hand)--"so, this gentleman's job is to give out information. He gives
LINE 607: all the information they need to people who are waiting, as our court
LINE 608: and its offices are not very well known among the public he gets asked
LINE 609: for quite a lot. He has an answer for every question, you can try him
LINE 610: out if you feel like it. But that's not his only distinction, his other
LINE 611: distinction is his elegance of dress. We, that's to say all of us who
LINE 612: work in the offices here, we decided that the information-giver would
LINE 613: have to be elegantly dressed as he continually has to deal with the
LINE 614: litigants and he's the first one they meet, so he needs to give a
LINE 615: dignified first impression. The rest of us I'm afraid, as you can see
LINE 616: just by looking at me, dress very badly and old-fashioned; and there's
LINE 617: not much point in spending much on clothes anyway, as we hardly ever
LINE 618: leave the offices, we even sleep here. But, as I said, we decided that
LINE 619: the information-giver would have to have nice clothes. As the management
LINE 620: here is rather peculiar in this respect, and they would get them for us,
LINE 621: we had a collection--some of the litigants contributed too--and bought
LINE 622: him these lovely clothes and some others besides. So everything would be
LINE 623: ready for him to give a good impression, except that he spoils it again
LINE 624: by laughing and frightening people." "That's how it is," said the man,
LINE 625: mocking her, "but I don't understand why it is that you're explaining
LINE 626: all our intimate facts to the gentleman, or rather why it is that you're
LINE 627: pressing them on him, as I'm sure he's not all interested. Just look at
LINE 628: him sitting there, it's clear he's occupied with his own affairs." K.
LINE 629: just did not feel like contradicting him. The girl's intention may have
LINE 630: been good, perhaps she was under instructions to distract him or to give
LINE 631: him the chance to collect himself, but the attempt had not worked. "I
LINE 632: had to explain to him why you were laughing," said the girl. "I suppose
LINE 633: it was insulting." "I think he would forgive even worse insults if I
LINE 634: finally took him outside." K. said nothing, did not even look up, he
LINE 635: tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was
LINE 636: even what suited him best. But suddenly he felt the information-giver's
LINE 637: hand on one arm and the young woman's hand on the other. "Up you get
LINE 638: then, weakling," said the information-giver. "Thank you both very much,"
LINE 639: said K., pleasantly surprised, as he slowly rose and personally guided
LINE 640: these unfamiliar hands to the places where he most needed support. As
LINE 641: they approached the corridor, the girl said quietly into K.'s ear, "I
LINE 642: must seem to think it's very important to show the information-giver in
LINE 643: a good light, but you shouldn't doubt what I say, I just want to say the
LINE 644: truth. He isn't hard-hearted. It's not really his job to help litigants
LINE 645: outside if they're unwell but he's doing it anyway, as you can see. I
LINE 646: don't suppose any of us is hard-hearted, perhaps we'd all like to be
LINE 647: helpful, but working for the court offices it's easy for us to give the
LINE 648: impression we are hard-hearted and don't want to help anyone. It makes
LINE 649: me quite sad." "Would you not like to sit down here a while?" asked the
LINE 650: information-giver, there were already in the corridor and just in front
LINE 651: of the defendant whom K. had spoken to earlier. K. felt almost ashamed
LINE 652: to be seen by him, earlier he had stood so upright in front of him and
LINE 653: now he had to be supported by two others, his hat was held up by the
LINE 654: information-giver balanced on outstretched fingers, his hair was
LINE 655: dishevelled and hung down onto the sweat on his forehead. But the
LINE 656: defendant seemed to notice nothing of what was going on and just stood
LINE 657: there humbly, as if wanting to apologise to the information-giver for
LINE 658: being there. The information-giver looked past him. "I know," he said,
LINE 659: "that my case can't be settled today, not yet, but I've come in anyway,
LINE 660: I thought, I thought I could wait here anyway, it's Sunday today, I've
LINE 661: got plenty of time, and I'm not disturbing anyone here." "There's no
LINE 662: need to be so apologetic," said the information-giver, "it's very
LINE 663: commendable for you to be so attentive. You are taking up space here
LINE 664: when you don't need to but as long as you don't get in my way I will do
LINE 665: nothing to stop you following the progress of your case as closely as
LINE 666: you like. When one has seen so many people who shamefully neglect their
LINE 667: cases one learns to show patience with people like you. Do sit down."
LINE 668: "He's very good with the litigants," whispered the girl. K. nodded, but
LINE 669: started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, "Would
LINE 670: you not like to sit down here a while?" "No," said K., "I don't want to
LINE 671: rest." He had said that as decisively as he could, but in fact it would
LINE 672: have done him a lot of good to sit down. It was as if he were suffering
LINE 673: sea-sickness. He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the
LINE 674: water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the
LINE 675: depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if
LINE 676: the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it
LINE 677: rising and sinking. It made the calmness of the girl and the man leading
LINE 678: him all the more incomprehensible. He was at their mercy, if they let go
LINE 679: of him he would fall like a board. Their little eyes glanced here and
LINE 680: there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the
LINE 681: same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried. He finally
LINE 682: noticed they were speaking to him but he did not understand them, all he
LINE 683: heard was a noise that filled all the space and through which there
LINE 684: seemed to be an unchanging higher note sounding, like a siren. "Louder,"
LINE 685: he whispered with his head sunk low, ashamed at having to ask them to
LINE 686: speak louder when he knew they had spoken loudly enough, even if it had
LINE 687: been, for him, incomprehensible. At last, a draught of cool air blew in
LINE 688: his face as if a gap had been torn out in the wall in front of him, and
LINE 689: next to him he heard someone say, "First he says he wants to go, and
LINE 690: then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the way out and he
LINE 691: doesn't move." K. became aware that he was standing in front of the way
LINE 692: out, and that the young woman had opened the door. It seemed to him that
LINE 693: all his strength returned to him at once, and to get a foretaste of
LINE 694: freedom he stepped straight on to one of the stairs and took his leave
LINE 695: there of his companions, who bowed to him. "Thank you very much," he
LINE 696: repeated, shook their hands once more and did not let go until he
LINE 697: thought he saw that they found it hard to bear the comparatively fresh
LINE 698: air from the stairway after being so long used to the air in the
LINE 699: offices. They were hardly able to reply, and the young woman might even
LINE 700: have fallen over if K. had not shut the door extremely fast. K. then
LINE 701: stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket
LINE 702: mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair--the information-giver
LINE 703: must have thrown it down there--and then he ran down the steps so fresh
LINE 704: and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly
LINE 705: frightened him. His normally sturdy state of health had never prepared
LINE 706: him for surprises such as this. Did his body want to revolt and cause
LINE 707: him a new trial as he was bearing the old one with such little effort?
LINE 708: He did not quite reject the idea that he should see a doctor the next
LINE 709: time he had the chance, but whatever he did--and this was something on
LINE 710: which he could advise himself--he wanted to spend all Sunday mornings in
LINE 711: future better than he had spent this one.
