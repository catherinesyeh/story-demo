LINE 1: ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA—SPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE
LINE 2: SUITORS—TELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH
LINE 3: MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.
LINE 4: Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared Telemachus
LINE 5: rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on t'his comely feet,
LINE 6: girded his sword about his shoulder, and left his room looking like an
LINE 7: immortal god. He at once sent the criers round t'call the people in
LINE 8: assembly, s'they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,
LINE 9: when they were got together, he went t'the place of assembly spear in
LINE 10: hand—not alone, for his tw'hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him
LINE 11: with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as
LINE 12: he went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat even the
LINE 13: oldest councillors made way for him.
LINE 14: Aegyptius, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience, was
LINE 15: the first t'speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses t'Ilius,
LINE 16: land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they
LINE 17: were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last dinner for him.17
LINE 18: He had three sons left, of whom tw'still worked on their father's
LINE 19: land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors; nevertheless
LINE 20: their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was still
LINE 21: weeping for him when he began his speech.
LINE 22: "Men of Ithaca," he said, "hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us
LINE 23: there has been n'meeting of our councillors until now; wh'then can it
LINE 24: be, whether old or young, that finds it s'necessary t'convene us? Has
LINE 25: he got wind of some host approaching, and does he wish t'warn us, or
LINE 26: would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is
LINE 27: an excellent person, and I hope Jove will grant him his heart's
LINE 28: desire."
LINE 29: Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for he
LINE 30: was bursting with what he had t'say. He stood in the middle of the
LINE 31: assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,
LINE 32: turning t'Aegyptius, "Sir," said he, "it is I, as you will shortly
LINE 33: learn, wh'have convened you, for it is I wh'am the most aggrieved. I
LINE 34: have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you,
LINE 35: nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My
LINE 36: grievance is purely personal, and turns on tw'great misfortunes which
LINE 37: have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my
LINE 38: excellent father, wh'was chief among all you here present, and was
LINE 39: like a father t'every one of you; the second is much more serious, and
LINE 40: ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief
LINE 41: men among you are pestering my mother t'marry them against her will.
LINE 42: They are afraid t'g't'her father Icarius, asking him t'choose the
LINE 43: one he likes best, and t'provide marriage gifts for his daughter, but
LINE 44: day by day they keep hanging about my father's house, sacrificing our
LINE 45: oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and never giving s'much
LINE 46: as a thought t'the quantity of wine they drink. N'estate can stand
LINE 47: such recklessness; we have now n'Ulysses t'ward off harm from our
LINE 48: doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days
LINE 49: be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had
LINE 50: power t'd'so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house
LINE 51: is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, t'your own
LINE 52: consciences and t'public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest
LINE 53: the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and
LINE 54: Themis, wh'is the beginning and the end of councils, [d'not] hold
LINE 55: back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded18—unless it be that my
LINE 56: brave father Ulysses did some wrong t'the Achaeans which you would now
LINE 57: avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am
LINE 58: t'be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the
LINE 59: eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you t'some
LINE 60: purpose, and serve you with notices from house t'house till I got paid
LINE 61: in full, whereas now I have n'remedy."19
LINE 62: With this Telemachus dashed his staff t'the ground and burst into
LINE 63: tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no
LINE 64: one ventured t'make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, wh'spoke
LINE 65: thus:
LINE 66: "Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try t'throw
LINE 67: the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for she
LINE 68: is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she
LINE 69: had been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us,
LINE 70: and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And
LINE 71: then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great
LINE 72: tambour frame in her room, and began t'work on an enormous piece of
LINE 73: fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead,
LINE 74: still d'not press me t'marry again immediately, wait—for I would not
LINE 75: have skill in needlework perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall
LINE 76: for the her'Laertes, t'be in readiness against the time when death
LINE 77: shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the place will talk
LINE 78: if he is laid out without a pall.'
LINE 79: "This was what she said, and we assented; whereon we could see her
LINE 80: working on her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick
LINE 81: the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three
LINE 82: years and we never found her out, but as time wore on and she was now
LINE 83: in her fourth year, one of her maids wh'knew what she was doing told
LINE 84: us, and we caught her in the act of undoing her work, s'she had to
LINE 85: finish it whether she would or no. The suitors, therefore, make you
LINE 86: this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand—'Send your
LINE 87: mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father's
LINE 88: choice'; for I d'not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us
LINE 89: much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the
LINE 90: accomplishments Minerva has taught her, and because she is s'clever.
LINE 91: We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro, Alcmena,
LINE 92: Mycene, and the famous women of old, but they were nothing t'your
LINE 93: mother any one of them. It was not fair of her t'treat us in that way,
LINE 94: and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now
LINE 95: endowed her, s'long shall we g'on eating up your estate; and I d'not
LINE 96: see why she should change, for she gets all the honour and glory, and
LINE 97: it is you wh'pay for it, not she. Understand, then, that we will not
LINE 98: g'back t'our lands, neither here nor elsewhere, till she has made her
LINE 99: choice and married some one or other of us."
LINE 100: Telemachus answered, "Antinous, how can I drive the mother wh'bore me
LINE 101: from my father's house? My father is abroad and we d'not know whether
LINE 102: he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have t'pay Icarius the
LINE 103: large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter
LINE 104: back t'him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will
LINE 105: als'punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on
LINE 106: the Erinyes t'avenge her; besides, it would not be a creditable thing
LINE 107: t'do, and I will have nothing t'say t'it. If you choose t'take
LINE 108: offence at this, leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another's
LINE 109: houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If, on the other hand, you
LINE 110: elect t'persist in spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove
LINE 111: shall reckon with you in full, and when you fall in my father's house
LINE 112: there shall be n'man t'avenge you."
LINE 113: As he spoke Jove sent tw'eagles from the top of the mountain, and they
LINE 114: flew on and on with the wind, sailing side by side in their own lordly
LINE 115: flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they
LINE 116: wheeled and circled about, beating the air with their wings and glaring
LINE 117: death int'the eyes of them that were below; then, fighting fiercely
LINE 118: and tearing at one another, they flew off towards the right over the
LINE 119: town. The people wondered as they saw them, and asked each other what
LINE 120: all this might be; whereon Halitherses, wh'was the best prophet and
LINE 121: reader of omens among them, spoke t'them plainly and in all honesty,
LINE 122: saying:
LINE 123: "Hear me, men of Ithaca, and I speak more particularly t'the suitors,
LINE 124: for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going t'be away
LINE 125: much longer; indeed he is close at hand t'deal out death and
LINE 126: destruction, not on them alone, but on many another of us wh'live in
LINE 127: Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time, and put a stop t'this wickedness
LINE 128: before he comes. Let the suitors d's'of their own accord; it will be
LINE 129: better for them, for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;
LINE 130: everything has happened t'Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set
LINE 131: out for Troy, and he with them. I said that after going through much
LINE 132: hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the
LINE 133: twentieth year and that n'one would know him; and now all this is
LINE 134: coming true."
LINE 135: Eurymachus son of Polybus then said, "G'home, old man, and prophesy to
LINE 136: your own children, or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens
LINE 137: myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the
LINE 138: sunshine somewhere or other, but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has
LINE 139: died in a far country, and it is a pity you are not dead along with
LINE 140: him, instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel t'the anger
LINE 141: of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he
LINE 142: will give you something for your family, but I tell you—and it shall
LINE 143: surely be—when an old man like you, wh'should know better, talks a
LINE 144: young one over till he becomes troublesome, in the first place his
LINE 145: young friend will only fare s'much the worse—he will take nothing by
LINE 146: it, for the suitors will prevent this—and in the next, we will lay a
LINE 147: heavier fine, sir, upon yourself than you will at all like paying, for
LINE 148: it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus, I warn him in the
LINE 149: presence of you all t'send his mother back t'her father, wh'will
LINE 150: find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts s'dear
LINE 151: a daughter may expect. Till then we shall g'on harassing him with our
LINE 152: suit; for we fear n'man, and care neither for him, with all his fine
LINE 153: speeches, nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much
LINE 154: as you please, but we shall only hate you the more. We shall g'back
LINE 155: and continue t'eat up Telemachus's estate without paying him, till
LINE 156: such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day
LINE 157: after day on the tiptoe of expectation, each vying with the other in
LINE 158: his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go
LINE 159: after the other women whom we should marry in due course, but for the
LINE 160: way in which she treats us."
LINE 161: Then Telemachus said, "Eurymachus, and you other suitors, I shall say
LINE 162: n'more, and entreat you n'further, for the gods and the people of
LINE 163: Ithaca now know my story. Give me, then, a ship and a crew of twenty
LINE 164: men t'take me hither and thither, and I will g't'Sparta and t'Pylos
LINE 165: in quest of my father wh'has s'long been missing. Some one may tell
LINE 166: me something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some
LINE 167: heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on
LINE 168: his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet
LINE 169: another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death, I will
LINE 170: return at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a
LINE 171: barrow t'his memory, and make my mother marry again."
LINE 172: With these words he sat down, and Mentor20 wh'had been a friend of
LINE 173: Ulysses, and had been left in charge of everything with full authority
LINE 174: over the servants, rose t'speak. He, then, plainly and in all honesty
LINE 175: addressed them thus:
LINE 176: "Hear me, men of Ithaca, I hope that you may never have a kind and
LINE 177: well-disposed ruler any more, nor one wh'will govern you equitably; I
LINE 178: hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust, for
LINE 179: there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses, wh'ruled you as
LINE 180: though he were your father. I am not half s'angry with the suitors,
LINE 181: for if they choose t'd'violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,
LINE 182: and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return, they can take the
LINE 183: high hand and eat up his estate, but as for you others I am shocked at
LINE 184: the way in which you all sit still without even trying t'stop such
LINE 185: scandalous goings on—which you could d'if you chose, for you are many
LINE 186: and they are few."
LINE 187: Leiocritus, son of Evenor, answered him saying, "Mentor, what folly is
LINE 188: all this, that you should set the people t'stay us? It is a hard thing
LINE 189: for one man t'fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses
LINE 190: himself were t'set upon us while we are feasting in his house, and do
LINE 191: his best t'oust us, his wife, wh'wants him back s'very badly, would
LINE 192: have small cause for rejoicing, and his blood would be upon his own
LINE 193: head if he fought against such great odds. There is n'sense in what
LINE 194: you have been saying. Now, therefore, d'you people g'about your
LINE 195: business, and let his father's old friends, Mentor and Halitherses,
LINE 196: speed this boy on his journey, if he goes at all—which I d'not think
LINE 197: he will, for he is more likely t'stay where he is till some one comes
LINE 198: and tells him something."
LINE 199: On this he broke up the assembly, and every man went back t'his own
LINE 200: abode, while the suitors returned t'the house of Ulysses.
LINE 201: Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side, washed his hands in the
LINE 202: grey waves, and prayed t'Minerva.
LINE 203: "Hear me," he cried, "you god wh'visited me yesterday, and bade me
LINE 204: sail the seas in search of my father wh'has s'long been missing. I
LINE 205: would obey you, but the Achaeans, and more particularly the wicked
LINE 206: suitors, are hindering me that I cannot d'so."
LINE 207: As he thus prayed, Minerva came close up t'him in the likeness and
LINE 208: with the voice of Mentor. "Telemachus," said she, "if you are made of
LINE 209: the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward
LINE 210: henceforward, for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half
LINE 211: done. If, then, you take after him, your voyage will not be fruitless,
LINE 212: but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins
LINE 213: I see n'likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as
LINE 214: their fathers; they are generally worse, not better; still, as you are
LINE 215: not going t'be either fool or coward henceforward, and are not
LINE 216: entirely without some share of your father's wise discernment, I look
LINE 217: with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause
LINE 218: with any of those foolish suitors, for they have neither sense nor
LINE 219: virtue, and give n'thought t'death and t'the doom that will shortly
LINE 220: fall on one and all of them, s'that they shall perish on the same day.
LINE 221: As for your voyage, it shall not be long delayed; your father was such
LINE 222: an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship, and will come with
LINE 223: you myself. Now, however, return home, and g'about among the suitors;
LINE 224: begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well
LINE 225: stowed, the wine in jars, and the barley meal, which is the staff of
LINE 226: life, in leathern bags, while I g'round the town and beat up
LINE 227: volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I
LINE 228: will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get
LINE 229: her ready and will put out t'sea without delay."
LINE 230: Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove, and Telemachus lost n'time in
LINE 231: doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home, and found the
LINE 232: suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous
LINE 233: came up t'him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,
LINE 234: saying, "Telemachus, my fine fire-eater, bear n'more ill blood neither
LINE 235: in word nor deed, but eat and drink with us as you used t'do. The
LINE 236: Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and a picked crew to
LINE 237: boot—s'that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your
LINE 238: noble father."
LINE 239: "Antinous," answered Telemachus, "I cannot eat in peace, nor take
LINE 240: pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that
LINE 241: you should waste s'much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?
LINE 242: Now that I am older and know more about it, I am als'stronger, and
LINE 243: whether here among this people, or by going t'Pylos, I will d'you all
LINE 244: the harm I can. I shall go, and my going will not be in vain—though,
LINE 245: thanks t'you suitors, I have neither ship nor crew of my own, and must
LINE 246: be passenger not captain."
LINE 247: As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the
LINE 248: others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings,21 jeering at
LINE 249: him tauntingly as they did so.
LINE 250: "Telemachus," said one youngster, "means t'be the death of us; I
LINE 251: suppose he thinks he can bring friends t'help him from Pylos, or again
LINE 252: from Sparta, where he seems bent on going. Or will he g't'Ephyra as
LINE 253: well, for poison t'put in our wine and kill us?"
LINE 254: Another said, "Perhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship, he will be
LINE 255: like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should
LINE 256: have plenty t'do, for we could then divide up his property amongst us:
LINE 257: as for the house we can let his mother and the man wh'marries her have
LINE 258: that."
LINE 259: This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down int'the lofty and
LINE 260: spacious store-room where his father's treasure of gold and bronze lay
LINE 261: heaped up upon the floor, and where the linen and spare clothes were
LINE 262: kept in open chests. Here, too, there was a store of fragrant olive
LINE 263: oil, while casks of old, well-ripened wine, unblended and fit for a god
LINE 264: t'drink, were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home
LINE 265: again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in
LINE 266: the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea, daughter
LINE 267: of Ops the son of Pisenor, was in charge of everything both night and
LINE 268: day. Telemachus called her t'the store-room and said:
LINE 269: "Nurse, draw me off some of the best wine you have, after what you are
LINE 270: keeping for my father's own drinking, in case, poor man, he should
LINE 271: escape death, and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve
LINE 272: jars, and see that they all have lids; als'fill me some well-sewn
LINE 273: leathern bags with barley meal—about twenty measures in all. Get these
LINE 274: things put together at once, and say nothing about it. I will take
LINE 275: everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for
LINE 276: the night. I am going t'Sparta and t'Pylos t'see if I can hear
LINE 277: anything about the return of my dear father."
LINE 278: When Euryclea heard this she began t'cry, and spoke fondly t'him,
LINE 279: saying, "My dear child, what ever can have put such notion as that into
LINE 280: your head? Where in the world d'you want t'g'to—you, wh'are the one
LINE 281: hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign
LINE 282: country nobody knows where, and as soon as your back is turned these
LINE 283: wicked ones here will be scheming t'get you put out of the way, and
LINE 284: will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are
LINE 285: among your own people, and d'not g'wandering and worrying your life
LINE 286: out on the barren ocean."
LINE 287: "Fear not, nurse," answered Telemachus, "my scheme is not without
LINE 288: heaven's sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this
LINE 289: t'my mother, till I have been away some ten or twelve days, unless she
LINE 290: hears of my having gone, and asks you; for I d'not want her t'spoil
LINE 291: her beauty by crying."
LINE 292: The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not, and when she had
LINE 293: completed her oath, she began drawing off the wine int'jars, and
LINE 294: getting the barley meal int'the bags, while Telemachus went back to
LINE 295: the suitors.
LINE 296: Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape, and
LINE 297: went round the town t'each one of the crew, telling them t'meet at
LINE 298: the ship by sundown. She went als't'Noemon son of Phronius, and asked
LINE 299: him t'let her have a ship—which he was very ready t'do. When the sun
LINE 300: had set and darkness was over all the land, she got the ship int'the
LINE 301: water, put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry, and
LINE 302: stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up,
LINE 303: and the goddess spoke encouragingly t'each of them.
LINE 304: Furthermore she went t'the house of Ulysses, and threw the suitors
LINE 305: int'a deep slumber. She caused their drink t'fuddle them, and made
LINE 306: them drop their cups from their hands, s'that instead of sitting over
LINE 307: their wine, they went back int'the town t'sleep, with their eyes
LINE 308: heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of
LINE 309: Mentor, and called Telemachus t'come outside.
LINE 310: "Telemachus," said she, "the men are on board and at their oars,
LINE 311: waiting for you t'give your orders, s'make haste and let us be off."
LINE 312: On this she led the way, while Telemachus followed in her steps. When
LINE 313: they got t'the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side, and
LINE 314: Telemachus said, "Now my men, help me t'get the stores on board; they
LINE 315: are all put together in the cloister, and my mother does not know
LINE 316: anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one."
LINE 317: With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When
LINE 318: they had brought the things as he told them, Telemachus went on board,
LINE 319: Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the
LINE 320: vessel, while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the
LINE 321: hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair
LINE 322: wind from the West,22 that whistled over the deep blue waves23 whereon
LINE 323: Telemachus told them t'catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and
LINE 324: they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross
LINE 325: plank, raised it, and made it fast with the forestays; then they
LINE 326: hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the
LINE 327: sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the deep blue
LINE 328: water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then
LINE 329: they made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing bowls t'the
LINE 330: brim, and made drink offerings t'the immortal gods that are from
LINE 331: everlasting, but more particularly t'the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.
LINE 332: Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night
LINE 333: from dark till dawn.
