LINE 1: THE VISIT T'KING MENELAUS, WH'TELLS HIS STORY—MEANWHILE THE SUITORS
LINE 2: IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.
LINE 3: they reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon, where they drove
LINE 4: straight t'the abode of Menelaus36 [and found him in his own house,
LINE 5: feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,
LINE 6: and als'of his daughter, whom he was marrying t'the son of that
LINE 7: valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to
LINE 8: him while he was still at Troy, and now the gods were bringing the
LINE 9: marriage about; s'he was sending her with chariots and horses t'the
LINE 10: city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles' son was reigning. For his
LINE 11: only son he had found a bride from Sparta,37 the daughter of Alector.
LINE 12: This son, Megapenthes, was born t'him of a bondwoman, for heaven
LINE 13: vouchsafed Helen n'more children after she had borne Hermione, wh'was
LINE 14: fair as golden Venus herself.
LINE 15: S'the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making
LINE 16: merry in his house. There was a bard als't'sing t'them and play his
LINE 17: lyre, while tw'tumblers went about performing in the midst of them
LINE 18: when the man struck up with his tune.38
LINE 19: Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,
LINE 20: whereon Eteoneus servant t'Menelaus came out, and as soon as he saw
LINE 21: them ran hurrying back int'the house t'tell his Master. He went close
LINE 22: up t'him and said, "Menelaus, there are some strangers come here, two
LINE 23: men, wh'look like sons of Jove. What are we t'do? Shall we take their
LINE 24: horses out, or tell them t'find friends elsewhere as they best can?"
LINE 25: Menelaus was very angry and said, "Eteoneus, son of Boethous, you never
LINE 26: used t'be a fool, but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses
LINE 27: out, of course, and show the strangers in that they may have supper;
LINE 28: you and I have staid often enough at other people's houses before we
LINE 29: got back here, where heaven grant that we may rest in peace
LINE 30: henceforward."
LINE 31: S'Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.
LINE 32: They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke, made them fast to
LINE 33: the mangers, and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they
LINE 34: leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard, and led the
LINE 35: way int'the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when
LINE 36: they saw it, for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then,
LINE 37: when they had admired everything t'their heart's content, they went
LINE 38: int'the bath room and washed themselves.
LINE 39: When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil, they
LINE 40: brought them woollen cloaks and shirts, and the tw'took their seats by
LINE 41: the side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful
LINE 42: golden ewer, and poured it int'a silver basin for them t'wash their
LINE 43: hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought
LINE 44: them bread, and offered them many good things of what there was in the
LINE 45: house, while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and
LINE 46: set cups of gold by their side.
LINE 47: Menelaus then greeted them saying, "Fall to, and welcome; when you have
LINE 48: done supper I shall ask wh'you are, for the lineage of such men as you
LINE 49: cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of
LINE 50: sceptre-bearing kings, for poor people d'not have such sons as you
LINE 51: are."
LINE 52: On this he handed them39 a piece of fat roast loin, which had been set
LINE 53: near him as being a prime part, and they laid their hands on the good
LINE 54: things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough t'eat and
LINE 55: drink, Telemachus said t'the son of Nestor, with his head s'close
LINE 56: that n'one might hear, "Look, Pisistratus, man after my own heart, see
LINE 57: the gleam of bronze and gold—of amber,40 ivory, and silver. Everything
LINE 58: is s'splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am
LINE 59: lost in admiration."
LINE 60: Menelaus overheard him and said, "N'one, my sons, can hold his own
LINE 61: with Jove, for his house and everything about him is immortal; but
LINE 62: among mortal men—well, there may be another wh'has as much wealth as I
LINE 63: have, or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and
LINE 64: have undergone much hardship, for it was nearly eight years before I
LINE 65: could get home with my fleet. I went t'Cyprus, Phoenicia and the
LINE 66: Egyptians; I went als't'the Ethiopians, the Sidonians, and the
LINE 67: Erembians, and t'Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are
LINE 68: born, and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that
LINE 69: country, whether master or man, has plenty of cheese, meat, and good
LINE 70: milk, for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling
LINE 71: and getting great riches among these people, my brother was secretly
LINE 72: and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife, s'that
LINE 73: I have n'pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your
LINE 74: parents may be they must have told you about all this, and of my heavy
LINE 75: loss in the ruin41 of a stately mansion fully and magnificently
LINE 76: furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have s'that I
LINE 77: had stayed at home, and all those were living wh'perished on the plain
LINE 78: of Troy, far from Argos. I often grieve, as I sit here in my house, for
LINE 79: one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow, but presently I
LINE 80: leave off again, for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it.
LINE 81: Yet grieve for these as I may, I d's'for one man more than for them
LINE 82: all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep,
LINE 83: s'miserable does he make me, for n'one of all the Achaeans worked so
LINE 84: hard or risked s'much as he did. He took nothing by it, and has left a
LINE 85: legacy of sorrow t'myself, for he has been gone a long time, and we
LINE 86: know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father, his
LINE 87: long-suffering wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus, whom he left
LINE 88: behind him an infant in arms, are plunged in grief on his account."
LINE 89: Thus spoke Menelaus, and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he
LINE 90: bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him
LINE 91: thus mentioned, s'that he held his cloak before his face with both
LINE 92: hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether t'let him choose his
LINE 93: own time for speaking, or t'ask him at once and find what it was all
LINE 94: about.
LINE 95: While he was thus in tw'minds Helen came down from her high vaulted
LINE 96: and perfumed room, looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought
LINE 97: her a seat, Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phyl'fetched her the
LINE 98: silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus
LINE 99: lived in Egyptian Thebes, which is the richest city in the whole world;
LINE 100: he gave Menelaus tw'baths, both of pure silver, tw'tripods, and ten
LINE 101: talents of gold; besides all this, his wife gave Helen some beautiful
LINE 102: presents, t'wit, a golden distaff, and a silver work box that ran on
LINE 103: wheels, with a gold band round the top of it. Phyl'now placed this by
LINE 104: her side, full of fine spun yarn, and a distaff charged with violet
LINE 105: coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat,
LINE 106: put her feet upon the footstool, and began t'question her husband.42
LINE 107: "D'we know, Menelaus," said she, "the names of these strangers who
LINE 108: have come t'visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?—but I cannot help
LINE 109: saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman s'like
LINE 110: somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what t'think)
LINE 111: as this young man is like Telemachus, whom Ulysses left as a baby
LINE 112: behind him, when you Achaeans went t'Troy with battle in your hearts,
LINE 113: on account of my most shameless self."
LINE 114: "My dear wife," replied Menelaus, "I see the likeness just as you do.
LINE 115: His hands and feet are just like Ulysses; s'is his hair, with the
LINE 116: shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover, when I was
LINE 117: talking about Ulysses, and saying how much he had suffered on my
LINE 118: account, tears fell from his eyes, and he hid his face in his mantle."
LINE 119: Then Pisistratus said, "Menelaus, son of Atreus, you are right in
LINE 120: thinking that this young man is Telemachus, but he is very modest, and
LINE 121: is ashamed t'come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose
LINE 122: conversation is s'divinely interesting as your own. My father, Nestor,
LINE 123: sent me t'escort him hither, for he wanted t'know whether you could
LINE 124: give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home
LINE 125: when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this
LINE 126: is how Telemachus is now placed, for his father is absent, and there is
LINE 127: n'one among his own people t'stand by him."
LINE 128: "Bless my heart," replied Menelaus, "then I am receiving a visit from
LINE 129: the son of a very dear friend, wh'suffered much hardship for my sake.
LINE 130: I had always hoped t'entertain him with most marked distinction when
LINE 131: heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have
LINE 132: founded a city for him in Argos, and built him a house. I should have
LINE 133: made him leave Ithaca with his goods, his son, and all his people, and
LINE 134: should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that
LINE 135: are subject t'me. We should thus have seen one another continually,
LINE 136: and nothing but death could have interrupted s'close and happy an
LINE 137: intercourse. I suppose, however, that heaven grudged us such great good
LINE 138: fortune, for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at
LINE 139: all."
LINE 140: Thus did he speak, and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,
LINE 141: Telemachus wept, and s'did Menelaus, nor could Pisistratus keep his
LINE 142: eyes from filling, when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom
LINE 143: the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said t'Menelaus,
LINE 144: "Sir, my father Nestor, when we used t'talk about you at home, told me
LINE 145: you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If, then, it be
LINE 146: possible, d'as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am
LINE 147: getting my supper. Morning will come in due course, and in the forenoon
LINE 148: I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all
LINE 149: we can d'for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and
LINE 150: wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother wh'died at Troy; he
LINE 151: was by n'means the worst man there; you are sure t'have known him—his
LINE 152: name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself, but they say
LINE 153: that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant."
LINE 154: "Your discretion, my friend," answered Menelaus, "is beyond your years.
LINE 155: It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is
LINE 156: son t'one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and
LINE 157: offspring—and it has blessed Nestor from first t'last all his days,
LINE 158: giving him a green old age in his own house, with sons about him who
LINE 159: are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore t'all
LINE 160: this weeping, and attend t'our supper again. Let water be poured over
LINE 161: our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the
LINE 162: morning."
LINE 163: On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands
LINE 164: and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.
LINE 165: Then Jove's daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged
LINE 166: the wine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour.
LINE 167: Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest
LINE 168: of the day, not even though his father and mother both of them drop
LINE 169: down dead, or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very
LINE 170: eyes. This drug, of such sovereign power and virtue, had been given to
LINE 171: Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon, a woman of Egypt, where there grow all
LINE 172: sorts of herbs, some good t'put int'the mixing bowl and others
LINE 173: poisonous. Moreover, every one in the whole country is a skilled
LINE 174: physician, for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this
LINE 175: drug in the bowl, and had told the servants t'serve the wine round,
LINE 176: she said:
LINE 177: "Menelaus, son of Atreus, and you my good friends, sons of honourable
LINE 178: men (which is as Jove wills, for he is the giver both of good and evil,
LINE 179: and can d'what he chooses), feast here as you will, and listen while I
LINE 180: tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the
LINE 181: exploits of Ulysses, but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,
LINE 182: and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself
LINE 183: with wounds and bruises, dressed himself all in rags, and entered the
LINE 184: enemy's city looking like a menial or a beggar, and quite different
LINE 185: from what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he
LINE 186: entered the city of Troy, and n'one said anything t'him. I alone
LINE 187: recognised him and began t'question him, but he was to'cunning for
LINE 188: me. When, however, I had washed and anointed him and had given him
LINE 189: clothes, and after I had sworn a solemn oath not t'betray him t'the
LINE 190: Trojans till he had got safely back t'his own camp and t'the ships,
LINE 191: he told me all that the Achaeans meant t'do. He killed many Trojans
LINE 192: and got much information before he reached the Argive camp, for all
LINE 193: which things the Trojan women made lamentation, but for my own part I
LINE 194: was glad, for my heart was beginning t'yearn after my home, and I was
LINE 195: unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,
LINE 196: away from my country, my girl, and my lawful wedded husband, wh'is
LINE 197: indeed by n'means deficient either in person or understanding."
LINE 198: Then Menelaus said, "All that you have been saying, my dear wife, is
LINE 199: true. I have travelled much, and have had much t'd'with heroes, but I
LINE 200: have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too, and
LINE 201: what courage he displayed within the wooden horse, wherein all the
LINE 202: bravest of the Argives were lying in wait t'bring death and
LINE 203: destruction upon the Trojans.43 At that moment you came up t'us; some
LINE 204: god wh'wished well t'the Trojans must have set you on t'it and you
LINE 205: had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you g'all round our hiding
LINE 206: place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name, and
LINE 207: mimicked all our wives—Diomed, Ulysses, and I from our seats inside
LINE 208: heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds
LINE 209: whether t'spring out then and there, or t'answer you from inside, but
LINE 210: Ulysses held us all in check, s'we sat quite still, all except
LINE 211: Anticlus, wh'was beginning t'answer you, when Ulysses clapped his two
LINE 212: brawny hands over his mouth, and kept them there. It was this that
LINE 213: saved us all, for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away
LINE 214: again."
LINE 215: "How sad," exclaimed Telemachus, "that all this was of n'avail t'save
LINE 216: him, nor yet his own iron courage. But now, sir, be pleased t'send us
LINE 217: all t'bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep."
LINE 218: On this Helen told the maid servants t'set beds in the room that was
LINE 219: in the gatehouse, and t'make them with good red rugs, and spread
LINE 220: coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to
LINE 221: wear. S'the maids went out, carrying a torch, and made the beds, to
LINE 222: which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus, then, did
LINE 223: Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt, while the son
LINE 224: of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.
LINE 225: When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Menelaus rose
LINE 226: and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on t'his comely feet, girded
LINE 227: his sword about his shoulders, and left his room looking like an
LINE 228: immortal god. Then, taking a seat near Telemachus he said:
LINE 229: "And what, Telemachus, has led you t'take this long sea voyage to
LINE 230: Lacedaemon? Are you on public, or private business? Tell me all about
LINE 231: it."
LINE 232: "I have come, sir," replied Telemachus, "t'see if you can tell me
LINE 233: anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my
LINE 234: fair estate is being wasted, and my house is full of miscreants who
LINE 235: keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen, on the pretence of
LINE 236: paying their addresses t'my mother. Therefore, I am suppliant at your
LINE 237: knees if haply you may tell me about my father's melancholy end,
LINE 238: whether you saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other
LINE 239: traveller; for he was a man born t'trouble. D'not soften things out
LINE 240: of any pity for myself, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you
LINE 241: saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by
LINE 242: word or deed, when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans, bear it
LINE 243: in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all."
LINE 244: Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. "So," he exclaimed,
LINE 245: "these cowards would usurp a brave man's bed? A hind might as well lay
LINE 246: her new born young in the lair of a lion, and then g'off t'feed in
LINE 247: the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back t'his
LINE 248: lair will make short work with the pair of them—and s'will Ulysses
LINE 249: with these suitors. By father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, if Ulysses is
LINE 250: still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in
LINE 251: Lesbos, and threw him s'heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him—if
LINE 252: he is still such and were t'come near these suitors, they would have a
LINE 253: short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions, however, I
LINE 254: will not prevaricate nor deceive you, but will tell you without
LINE 255: concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.
LINE 256: "I was trying t'come on here, but the gods detained me in Egypt, for
LINE 257: my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction, and the gods are
LINE 258: very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt, about as far as a
LINE 259: ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her, there is an
LINE 260: island called Pharos—it has a good harbour from which vessels can get
LINE 261: out int'open sea when they have taken in water—and here the gods
LINE 262: becalmed me twenty days without s'much as a breath of fair wind to
LINE 263: help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men
LINE 264: would have starved, if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved
LINE 265: me in the person of Idothea, daughter t'Proteus, the old man of the
LINE 266: sea, for she had taken a great fancy t'me.
LINE 267: "She came t'me one day when I was by myself, as I often was, for the
LINE 268: men used t'g'with their barbed hooks, all over the island in the hope
LINE 269: of catching a fish or tw't'save them from the pangs of hunger.
LINE 270: 'Stranger,' said she, 'it seems t'me that you like starving in this
LINE 271: way—at any rate it does not greatly trouble you, for you stick here day
LINE 272: after day, without even trying t'get away though your men are dying by
LINE 273: inches.'
LINE 274: "'Let me tell you,' said I, 'whichever of the goddesses you may happen
LINE 275: t'be, that I am not staying here of my own accord, but must have
LINE 276: offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me, therefore, for the gods
LINE 277: know everything, which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in
LINE 278: this way, and tell me als'how I may sail the sea s'as t'reach my
LINE 279: home.'
LINE 280: "'Stranger,' replied she, 'I will make it all quite clear t'you. There
LINE 281: is an old immortal wh'lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is
LINE 282: Proteus. He is an Egyptian, and people say he is my father; he is
LINE 283: Neptune's head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom
LINE 284: of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight, he will tell you
LINE 285: about your voyage, what courses you are t'take, and how you are to
LINE 286: sail the sea s'as t'reach your home. He will als'tell you, if you so
LINE 287: will, all that has been going on at your house both good and bad, while
LINE 288: you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.'
LINE 289: "'Can you show me,' said I, 'some stratagem by means of which I may
LINE 290: catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a
LINE 291: god is not easily caught—not by a mortal man.'
LINE 292: "'Stranger,' said she, 'I will make it all quite clear t'you. About
LINE 293: the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven, the old man of the
LINE 294: sea comes up from under the waves, heralded by the West wind that furs
LINE 295: the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down, and
LINE 296: goes t'sleep in a great sea cave, where the seals—Halosydne's chickens
LINE 297: as they call them—come up als'from the grey sea, and g't'sleep in
LINE 298: shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell d'they
LINE 299: bring with them. 44 Early to-morrow morning I will take you t'this
LINE 300: place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out, therefore, the three best
LINE 301: men you have in your fleet, and I will tell you all the tricks that the
LINE 302: old man will play you.
LINE 303: "'First he will look over all his seals, and count them; then, when he
LINE 304: has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers, he will g't'sleep
LINE 305: among them, as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he
LINE 306: is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast, for
LINE 307: he will d'his very utmost t'get away from you. He will turn himself
LINE 308: int'every kind of creature that goes upon the earth, and will become
LINE 309: als'both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him
LINE 310: tighter and tighter, till he begins t'talk t'you and comes back to
LINE 311: what he was when you saw him g't'sleep; then you may slacken your
LINE 312: hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that
LINE 313: is angry with you, and what you must d't'reach your home over the
LINE 314: seas.'
LINE 315: "Having s'said she dived under the waves, whereon I turned back t'the
LINE 316: place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was
LINE 317: clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper
LINE 318: ready, for night was falling, and camped down upon the beach.
LINE 319: "When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, I took the
LINE 320: three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely, and went
LINE 321: along by the sea-side, praying heartily t'heaven. Meanwhile the
LINE 322: goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea, all
LINE 323: of them just skinned, for she meant playing a trick upon her father.
LINE 324: Then she dug four pits for us t'lie in, and sat down t'wait till we
LINE 325: should come up. When we were close t'her, she made us lie down in the
LINE 326: pits one after the other, and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our
LINE 327: ambuscade would have been intolerable, for the stench of the fishy
LINE 328: seals was most distressing45—wh'would g't'bed with a sea monster if
LINE 329: he could help it?—but here, too, the goddess helped us, and thought of
LINE 330: something that gave us great relief, for she put some ambrosia under
LINE 331: each man's nostrils, which was s'fragrant that it killed the smell of
LINE 332: the seals.46
LINE 333: "We waited the whole morning and made the best of it, watching the
LINE 334: seals come up in hundreds t'bask upon the sea shore, till at noon the
LINE 335: old man of the sea came up too, and when he had found his fat seals he
LINE 336: went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,
LINE 337: and he never suspected any guile, but laid himself down t'sleep as
LINE 338: soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and
LINE 339: seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks, and changed
LINE 340: himself first int'a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he
LINE 341: became a dragon, a leopard, a wild boar; the next moment he was running
LINE 342: water, and then again directly he was a tree, but we stuck t'him and
LINE 343: never lost hold, till at last the cunning old creature became
LINE 344: distressed, and said, 'Which of the gods was it, Son of Atreus, that
LINE 345: hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my
LINE 346: will? What d'you want?'
LINE 347: "'You know that yourself, old man,' I answered, 'you will gain nothing
LINE 348: by trying t'put me off. It is because I have been kept s'long in this
LINE 349: island, and see n'sign of my being able t'get away. I am losing all
LINE 350: heart; tell me, then, for you gods know everything, which of the
LINE 351: immortals it is that is hindering me, and tell me als'how I may sail
LINE 352: the sea s'as t'reach my home?'
LINE 353: "Then,' he said, 'if you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,
LINE 354: you must offer sacrifices t'Jove and t'the rest of the gods before
LINE 355: embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back t'your
LINE 356: friends, and t'your own house, till you have returned t'the
LINE 357: heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered holy hecatombs t'the immortal
LINE 358: gods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you
LINE 359: finish your voyage.'
LINE 360: "I was broken hearted when I heard that I must g'back all that long
LINE 361: and terrible voyage t'Egypt;47 nevertheless, I answered, 'I will do
LINE 362: all, old man, that you have laid upon me; but now tell me, and tell me
LINE 363: true, whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we
LINE 364: set sail from Troy have got home safely, or whether any one of them
LINE 365: came t'a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends
LINE 366: when the days of his fighting were done.'
LINE 367: "'Son of Atreus,' he answered, 'why ask me? You had better not know
LINE 368: what I can tell you, for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard
LINE 369: my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone, but many
LINE 370: still remain, and only tw'of the chief men among the Achaeans perished
LINE 371: during their return home. As for what happened on the field of
LINE 372: battle—you were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,
LINE 373: alive, but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked, for Neptune drove
LINE 374: him on t'the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless, he let him get safe
LINE 375: out of the water, and in spite of all Minerva's hatred he would have
LINE 376: escaped death, if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the
LINE 377: gods could not drown him even though they had tried t'd'so, and when
LINE 378: Neptune heard this large talk, he seized his trident in his tw'brawny
LINE 379: hands, and split the rock of Gyrae in tw'pieces. The base remained
LINE 380: where it was, but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into
LINE 381: the sea and carried Ajax with it; s'he drank salt water and was
LINE 382: drowned.
LINE 383: "'Your brother and his ships escaped, for Jun'protected him, but when
LINE 384: he was just about t'reach the high promontory of Malea, he was caught
LINE 385: by a heavy gale which carried him out t'sea again sorely against his
LINE 386: will, and drove him t'the foreland where Thyestes used t'dwell, but
LINE 387: where Aegisthus was then living. By and by, however, it seemed as
LINE 388: though he was t'return safely after all, for the gods backed the wind
LINE 389: int'its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed
LINE 390: his native soil, and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own
LINE 391: country.
LINE 392: "'Now there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch, and
LINE 393: t'whom he had promised tw'talents of gold. This man had been looking
LINE 394: out for a whole year t'make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the
LINE 395: slip and prepare war; when, therefore, this man saw Agamemnon g'by, he
LINE 396: went and told Aegisthus, wh'at once began t'lay a plot for him. He
LINE 397: picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on
LINE 398: one side the cloister, while on the opposite side he prepared a
LINE 399: banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen t'Agamemnon, and
LINE 400: invited him t'the feast, but he meant foul play. He got him there, all
LINE 401: unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him, and killed him when the
LINE 402: banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles;
LINE 403: not one of Agamemnon's followers was left alive, nor yet one of
LINE 404: Aegisthus', but they were all killed there in the cloisters.'
LINE 405: "Thus spoke Proteus, and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat
LINE 406: down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could n'longer bear
LINE 407: t'live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently, when I had had
LINE 408: my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground, the old man of the sea
LINE 409: said, 'Son of Atreus, d'not waste any more time in crying s'bitterly;
LINE 410: it can d'n'manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you
LINE 411: can, for Aegisthus may be still alive, and even though Orestes has been
LINE 412: beforehand with you in killing him, you may yet come in for his
LINE 413: funeral.'
LINE 414: "On this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow, and said, 'I know,
LINE 415: then, about these two; tell me, therefore, about the third man of whom
LINE 416: you spoke; is he still alive, but at sea, and unable t'get home? or is
LINE 417: he dead? Tell me, n'matter how much it may grieve me.'
LINE 418: "'The third man,' he answered, 'is Ulysses wh'dwells in Ithaca. I can
LINE 419: see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph
LINE 420: Calypso, wh'is keeping him prisoner, and he cannot reach his home for
LINE 421: he has n'ships nor sailors t'take him over the sea. As for your own
LINE 422: end, Menelaus, you shall not die in Argos, but the gods will take you
LINE 423: t'the Elysian plain, which is at the ends of the world. There
LINE 424: fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns, and men lead an easier life than any
LINE 425: where else in the world, for in Elysium there falls not rain, nor hail,
LINE 426: nor snow, but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly
LINE 427: from the sea, and gives fresh life t'all men. This will happen t'you
LINE 428: because you have married Helen, and are Jove's son-in-law.'
LINE 429: "As he spoke he dived under the waves, whereon I turned back t'the
LINE 430: ships with my companions, and my heart was clouded with care as I went
LINE 431: along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready, for night was
LINE 432: falling, and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,
LINE 433: rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we drew our ships int'the water, and put
LINE 434: our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves, took
LINE 435: our seats on the benches, and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again
LINE 436: stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt, and offered
LINE 437: hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased
LINE 438: heaven's anger, I raised a barrow t'the memory of Agamemnon that his
LINE 439: name might live for ever, after which I had a quick passage home, for
LINE 440: the gods sent me a fair wind.
LINE 441: "And now for yourself—stay here some ten or twelve days longer, and I
LINE 442: will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a
LINE 443: chariot and three horses. I will als'give you a beautiful chalice that
LINE 444: s'long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a
LINE 445: drink-offering t'the immortal gods."
LINE 446: "Son of Atreus," replied Telemachus, "d'not press me t'stay longer; I
LINE 447: should be contented t'remain with you for another twelve months; I
LINE 448: find your conversation s'delightful that I should never once wish
LINE 449: myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos
LINE 450: are already impatient, and you are detaining me from them. As for any
LINE 451: present you may be disposed t'make me, I had rather that it should be
LINE 452: a piece of plate. I will take n'horses back with me t'Ithaca, but
LINE 453: will leave them t'adorn your own stables, for you have much flat
LINE 454: ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives, as als'meadow-sweet and
LINE 455: wheat and barley, and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas
LINE 456: in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses, and the country
LINE 457: is more fit for goats than horses, and I like it the better for that.
LINE 458: 48 None of our islands have much level ground, suitable for horses, and
LINE 459: Ithaca least of all."
LINE 460: Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus's hand within his own. "What you
LINE 461: say," said he, "shows that you come of good family. I both can, and
LINE 462: will, make this exchange for you, by giving you the finest and most
LINE 463: precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by
LINE 464: Vulcan's own hand, of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with
LINE 465: gold. Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me in the course of a
LINE 466: visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.
LINE 467: I will make you a present of it."
LINE 468: Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming t'the king's house.
LINE 469: They brought sheep and wine, while their wives had put up bread for
LINE 470: them t'take with them; s'they were busy cooking their dinners in the
LINE 471: courts].49
LINE 472: Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a
LINE 473: mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses' house, and were
LINE 474: behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus, who
LINE 475: were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all, were
LINE 476: sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to
LINE 477: Antinous,
LINE 478: "Have we any idea, Antinous, on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?
LINE 479: He has a ship of mine, and I want it, t'cross over t'Elis: I have
LINE 480: twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet
LINE 481: broken in, and I want t'bring one of them over here and break him."
LINE 482: They were astounded when they heard this, for they had made sure that
LINE 483: Telemachus had not gone t'the city of Neleus. They thought he was only
LINE 484: away somewhere on the farms, and was with the sheep, or with the
LINE 485: swineherd; s'Antinous said, "When did he go? Tell me truly, and what
LINE 486: young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own
LINE 487: bondsmen—for he might manage that too? Tell me also, did you let him
LINE 488: have the ship of your own free will because he asked you, or did he
LINE 489: take it without your leave?"
LINE 490: "I lent it him," answered Noemon, "what else could I d'when a man of
LINE 491: his position said he was in a difficulty, and asked me t'oblige him? I
LINE 492: could not possibly refuse. As for those wh'went with him they were the
LINE 493: best young men we have, and I saw Mentor g'on board as captain—or some
LINE 494: god wh'was exactly like him. I cannot understand it, for I saw Mentor
LINE 495: here myself yesterday morning, and yet he was then setting out for
LINE 496: Pylos."
LINE 497: Noemon then went back t'his father's house, but Antinous and
LINE 498: Eurymachus were very angry. They told the others t'leave off playing,
LINE 499: and t'come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,
LINE 500: Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with
LINE 501: rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he said:
LINE 502: "Good heavens, this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we
LINE 503: had made sure that it would come t'nothing, but the young fellow has
LINE 504: got away in spite of us, and with a picked crew too. He will be giving
LINE 505: us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find
LINE 506: me a ship, therefore, with a crew of twenty men, and I will lie in wait
LINE 507: for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the
LINE 508: day that he set out t'try and get news of his father."
LINE 509: Thus did he speak, and the others applauded his saying; they then all
LINE 510: of them went inside the buildings.
LINE 511: It was not long ere Penelope came t'know what the suitors were
LINE 512: plotting; for a man servant, Medon, overheard them from outside the
LINE 513: outer court as they were laying their schemes within, and went t'tell
LINE 514: his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:
LINE 515: "Medon, what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it t'tell the
LINE 516: maids t'leave their master's business and cook dinner for them? I wish
LINE 517: they may neither wo'nor dine henceforward, neither here nor anywhere
LINE 518: else, but let this be the very last time, for the waste you all make of
LINE 519: my son's estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children,
LINE 520: how good Ulysses had been t'them—never doing anything high-handed, nor
LINE 521: speaking harshly t'anybody? Kings may say things sometimes, and they
LINE 522: may take a fancy t'one man and dislike another, but Ulysses never did
LINE 523: an unjust thing by anybody—which shows what bad hearts you have, and
LINE 524: that there is n'such thing as gratitude left in this world."
LINE 525: Then Medon said, "I wish, Madam, that this were all; but they are
LINE 526: plotting something much more dreadful now—may heaven frustrate their
LINE 527: design. They are going t'try and murder Telemachus as he is coming
LINE 528: home from Pylos and Lacedaemon, where he has been t'get news of his
LINE 529: father."
LINE 530: Then Penelope's heart sank within her, and for a long time she was
LINE 531: speechless; her eyes filled with tears, and she could find no
LINE 532: utterance. At last, however, she said, "Why did my son leave me? What
LINE 533: business had he t'g'sailing off in ships that make long voyages over
LINE 534: the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want t'die without leaving any one
LINE 535: behind him t'keep up his name?"
LINE 536: "I d'not know," answered Medon, "whether some god set him on t'it, or
LINE 537: whether he went on his own impulse t'see if he could find out if his
LINE 538: father was dead, or alive and on his way home."
LINE 539: Then he went downstairs again, leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.
LINE 540: There were plenty of seats in the house, but she had n'heart for
LINE 541: sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor
LINE 542: of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house, both old
LINE 543: and young, gathered round her and began t'cry too, till at last in a
LINE 544: transport of sorrow she exclaimed,
LINE 545: "My dears, heaven has been pleased t'try me with more affliction than
LINE 546: any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and
LINE 547: lion-hearted husband, wh'had every good quality under heaven, and
LINE 548: whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos, and now my
LINE 549: darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves, without my having
LINE 550: heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies, there was not one
LINE 551: of you would s'much as think of giving me a call out of my bed, though
LINE 552: you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he
LINE 553: meant taking this voyage, he would have had t'give it up, n'matter
LINE 554: how much he was bent upon it, or leave me a corpse behind him—one or
LINE 555: other. Now, however, g'some of you and call old Dolius, wh'was given
LINE 556: me by my father on my marriage, and wh'is my gardener. Bid him g'at
LINE 557: once and tell everything t'Laertes, wh'may be able t'hit on some
LINE 558: plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side, as against those who
LINE 559: are trying t'exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses."
LINE 560: Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said, "You may kill me, Madam, or let
LINE 561: me live on in your house, whichever you please, but I will tell you the
LINE 562: real truth. I knew all about it, and gave him everything he wanted in
LINE 563: the way of bread and wine, but he made me take my solemn oath that I
LINE 564: would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days, unless you
LINE 565: asked or happened t'hear of his having gone, for he did not want you
LINE 566: t'spoil your beauty by crying. And now, Madam, wash your face, change
LINE 567: your dress, and g'upstairs with your maids t'offer prayers to
LINE 568: Minerva, daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, for she can save him even
LINE 569: though he be in the jaws of death. D'not trouble Laertes: he has
LINE 570: trouble enough already. Besides, I cannot think that the gods hate the
LINE 571: race of the son of Arceisius s'much, but there will be a son left to
LINE 572: come up after him, and inherit both the house and the fair fields that
LINE 573: lie far all round it."
LINE 574: With these words she made her mistress leave off crying, and dried the
LINE 575: tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face, changed her dress, and
LINE 576: went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley int'a
LINE 577: basket and began praying t'Minerva.
LINE 578: "Hear me," she cried, "Daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable. If
LINE 579: ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or
LINE 580: heifer, bear it in mind now as in my favour, and save my darling son
LINE 581: from the villainy of the suitors."
LINE 582: She cried aloud as she spoke, and the goddess heard her prayer;
LINE 583: meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,
LINE 584: and one of them said:
LINE 585: "The queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.
LINE 586: Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed t'die."
LINE 587: This was what they said, but they did not know what was going to
LINE 588: happen. Then Antinous said, "Comrades, let there be n'loud talking,
LINE 589: lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and d'that in
LINE 590: silence, about which we are all of a mind."
LINE 591: He then chose twenty men, and they went down t'their ship and t'the
LINE 592: sea side; they drew the vessel int'the water and got her mast and
LINE 593: sails inside her; they bound the oars t'the thole-pins with twisted
LINE 594: thongs of leather, all in due course, and spread the white sails aloft,
LINE 595: while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the
LINE 596: ship fast a little way out, came on shore again, got their suppers, and
LINE 597: waited till night should fall.
LINE 598: But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable t'eat or drink, and
LINE 599: wondering whether her brave son would escape, or be overpowered by the
LINE 600: wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen
LINE 601: hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into
LINE 602: a slumber, and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.
LINE 603: Then Minerva bethought her of another matter, and made a vision in the
LINE 604: likeness of Penelope's sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius wh'had
LINE 605: married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision t'g't'the
LINE 606: house of Ulysses, and t'make Penelope leave off crying, s'it came
LINE 607: int'her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the
LINE 608: door to, and hovered over her head saying,
LINE 609: "You are asleep, Penelope: the gods wh'live at ease will not suffer
LINE 610: you t'weep and be s'sad. Your son has done them n'wrong, s'he will
LINE 611: yet come back t'you."
LINE 612: Penelope, wh'was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland, answered,
LINE 613: "Sister, why have you come here? You d'not come very often, but I
LINE 614: suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I, then, to
LINE 615: leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?
LINE 616: I, wh'have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband, wh'had every good
LINE 617: quality under heaven, and whose name was great over all Hellas and
LINE 618: middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship—a
LINE 619: foolish fellow wh'has never been used t'roughing it, nor t'going
LINE 620: about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than
LINE 621: about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him, lest
LINE 622: something should happen t'him, either from the people among whom he
LINE 623: has gone, or by sea, for he has many enemies wh'are plotting against
LINE 624: him, and are bent on killing him before he can return home."
LINE 625: Then the vision said, "Take heart, and be not s'much dismayed. There
LINE 626: is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough t'have stand
LINE 627: by his side, I mean Minerva; it is she wh'has compassion upon you, and
LINE 628: wh'has sent me t'bear you this message."
LINE 629: "Then," said Penelope, "if you are a god or have been sent here by
LINE 630: divine commission, tell me als'about that other unhappy one—is he
LINE 631: still alive, or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?"
LINE 632: And the vision said, "I shall not tell you for certain whether he is
LINE 633: alive or dead, and there is n'use in idle conversation."
LINE 634: Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated
LINE 635: int'thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and
LINE 636: comforted, s'vivid had been her dream.
LINE 637: Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea,
LINE 638: intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called
LINE 639: Asteris, of n'great size, in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos, and
LINE 640: there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then
LINE 641: the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.
