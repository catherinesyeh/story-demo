LINE 1: RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.
LINE 2: Thus, then, did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on t'the
LINE 3: town. When she reached her father's house she drew up at the gateway,
LINE 4: and her brothers—comely as the gods—gathered round her, took the mules
LINE 5: out of the waggon, and carried the clothes int'the house, while she
LINE 6: went t'her own room, where an old servant, Eurymedusa of Apeira, lit
LINE 7: the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,
LINE 8: and had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over
LINE 9: the Phaeacians, and the people obeyed him as though he were a god.57
LINE 10: She had been nurse t'Nausicaa, and had now lit the fire for her, and
LINE 11: brought her supper for her int'her own room.
LINE 12: Presently Ulysses got up t'g'towards the town; and Minerva shed a
LINE 13: thick mist all round him t'hide him in case any of the proud
LINE 14: Phaeacians wh'met him should be rude t'him, or ask him wh'he was.
LINE 15: Then, as he was just entering the town, she came towards him in the
LINE 16: likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front
LINE 17: of him, and Ulysses said:
LINE 18: "My dear, will you be s'kind as t'show me the house of king Alcinous?
LINE 19: I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress, and d'not know one in your
LINE 20: town and country."
LINE 21: Then Minerva said, "Yes, father stranger, I will show you the house you
LINE 22: want, for Alcinous lives quite close t'my own father. I will g'before
LINE 23: you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and d'not look at
LINE 24: any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide
LINE 25: strangers, and d'not like men wh'come from some other place. They are
LINE 26: a sea-faring folk, and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships
LINE 27: that glide along like thought, or as a bird in the air."
LINE 28: On this she led the way, and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one
LINE 29: of the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the
LINE 30: midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards
LINE 31: him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their
LINE 32: harbours, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city,
LINE 33: which, with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when
LINE 34: they reached the king's house Minerva said:
LINE 35: "This is the house, father stranger, which you would have me show you.
LINE 36: You will find a number of great people sitting at table, but d'not be
LINE 37: afraid; g'straight in, for the bolder a man is the more likely he is
LINE 38: t'carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the queen.
LINE 39: Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband
LINE 40: Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune, wh'was father to
LINE 41: Nausithous by Periboea, a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the
LINE 42: youngest daughter of Eurymedon, wh'at one time reigned over the
LINE 43: giants, but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to
LINE 44: boot.
LINE 45: "Neptune, however, lay with his daughter, and she had a son by him, the
LINE 46: great Nausithous, wh'reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two
LINE 47: sons Rhexenor and Alcinous;58 Apoll'killed the first of them while he
LINE 48: was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter
LINE 49: Arete, whom Alcinous married, and honours as n'other woman is honoured
LINE 50: of all those that keep house along with their husbands.
LINE 51: "Thus she both was, and still is, respected beyond measure by her
LINE 52: children, by Alcinous himself, and by the whole people, wh'look upon
LINE 53: her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city, for
LINE 54: she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart, and when any
LINE 55: women are friends of hers, she will help their husbands als't'settle
LINE 56: their disputes. If you can gain her good will, you may have every hope
LINE 57: of seeing your friends again, and getting safely back t'your home and
LINE 58: country."
LINE 59: Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to
LINE 60: Marathon59 and t'the spacious streets of Athens, where she entered the
LINE 61: abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on t'the house of Alcinous, and
LINE 62: he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of
LINE 63: bronze, for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or
LINE 64: moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end t'end, and the
LINE 65: cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of
LINE 66: silver that rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver
LINE 67: and the hook of the door was of gold.
LINE 68: On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan, with
LINE 69: his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly t'keep watch over the
LINE 70: palace of king Alcinous; s'they were immortal and could never grow
LINE 71: old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one end
LINE 72: t'the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the
LINE 73: house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used t'sit
LINE 74: and eat and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there
LINE 75: were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands,
LINE 76: raised on pedestals, t'give light by night t'those wh'were at table.
LINE 77: There are60 fifty maid servants in the house, some of whom are always
LINE 78: grinding rich yellow grain at the mill, while others work at the loom,
LINE 79: or sit and spin, and their shuttles g'backwards and forwards like the
LINE 80: fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen is s'closely woven that it
LINE 81: will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world, so
LINE 82: their women excel all others in weaving, for Minerva has taught them
LINE 83: all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.
LINE 84: Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about
LINE 85: four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful
LINE 86: trees—pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are
LINE 87: luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor
LINE 88: fail all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so
LINE 89: soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on
LINE 90: pear, apple on apple, and fig on fig, and s'als'with the grapes, for
LINE 91: there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,
LINE 92: the grapes are being made int'raisins; in another part they are being
LINE 93: gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs, others further on
LINE 94: have shed their blossom and are beginning t'show fruit, others again
LINE 95: are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are
LINE 96: beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year
LINE 97: round. Tw'streams g'through it, the one turned in ducts throughout
LINE 98: the whole garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the
LINE 99: outer court t'the house itself, and the town's people draw water from
LINE 100: it. Such, then, were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the
LINE 101: house of king Alcinous.
LINE 102: S'here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him, but when he had
LINE 103: looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the
LINE 104: precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the
LINE 105: Phaeacians making their drink offerings t'Mercury, which they always
LINE 106: did the last thing before going away for the night.61 He went straight
LINE 107: through the court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which
LINE 108: Minerva had enveloped him, till he reached Arete and King Alcinous;
LINE 109: then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen, and at that moment
LINE 110: the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every
LINE 111: one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there, but Ulysses
LINE 112: began at once with his petition.
LINE 113: "Queen Arete," he exclaimed, "daughter of great Rhexenor, in my
LINE 114: distress I humbly pray you, as als'your husband and these your guests
LINE 115: (whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness, and may they
LINE 116: leave their possessions t'their children, and all the honours
LINE 117: conferred upon them by the state) t'help me home t'my own country as
LINE 118: soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my
LINE 119: friends."
LINE 120: Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their
LINE 121: peace, till presently the old her'Echeneus, wh'was an excellent
LINE 122: speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty
LINE 123: addressed them thus:
LINE 124: "Alcinous," said he, "it is not creditable t'you that a stranger
LINE 125: should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is
LINE 126: waiting t'hear what you are about t'say; tell him, then, t'rise and
LINE 127: take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix
LINE 128: some wine and water that we may make a drink offering t'Jove the lord
LINE 129: of thunder, wh'takes all well disposed suppliants under his
LINE 130: protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever
LINE 131: there may be in the house."
LINE 132: When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand, raised him from
LINE 133: the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas, wh'had been
LINE 134: sitting beside him, and was his favourite son. A maid servant then
LINE 135: brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it int'a
LINE 136: silver basin for him t'wash his hands, and she drew a clean table
LINE 137: beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many
LINE 138: good things of what there was in the house, and Ulysses ate and drank.
LINE 139: Then Alcinous said t'one of the servants, "Pontonous, mix a cup of
LINE 140: wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings t'Jove the
LINE 141: lord of thunder, wh'is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants."
LINE 142: Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving
LINE 143: every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and
LINE 144: had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alcinous said:
LINE 145: "Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words. You
LINE 146: have had your supper, s'now g'home t'bed. To-morrow morning I shall
LINE 147: invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will give a sacrificial
LINE 148: banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his
LINE 149: escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing t'his
LINE 150: own country without trouble or inconvenience t'himself, n'matter how
LINE 151: distant it may be. We must see that he comes t'n'harm while on his
LINE 152: homeward journey, but when he is once at home he will have t'take the
LINE 153: luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is
LINE 154: possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals wh'has
LINE 155: come down from heaven t'visit us; but in this case the gods are
LINE 156: departing from their usual practice, for hithert'they have made
LINE 157: themselves perfectly clear t'us when we have been offering them
LINE 158: hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,
LINE 159: and if any solitary wayfarer happens t'stumble upon some one or other
LINE 160: of them, they affect n'concealment, for we are as near of kin t'the
LINE 161: gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are."62
LINE 162: Then Ulysses said: "Pray, Alcinous, d'not take any such notion into
LINE 163: your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me, neither in body nor
LINE 164: mind, and most resemble those among you wh'are the most afflicted.
LINE 165: Indeed, were I t'tell you all that heaven has seen fit t'lay upon me,
LINE 166: you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,
LINE 167: let me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very
LINE 168: importunate thing, and thrusts itself on a man's notice n'matter how
LINE 169: dire is his distress. I am in great trouble, yet it insists that I
LINE 170: shall eat and drink, bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and
LINE 171: dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves, d'as
LINE 172: you propose, and at break of day set about helping me t'get home. I
LINE 173: shall be content t'die if I may first once more behold my property, my
LINE 174: bondsmen, and all the greatness of my house."63
LINE 175: Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying, and agreed that he
LINE 176: should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when
LINE 177: they had made their drink offerings, and had drunk each as much as he
LINE 178: was minded they went home t'bed every man in his own abode, leaving
LINE 179: Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were
LINE 180: taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first t'speak, for
LINE 181: she recognised the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Ulysses was
LINE 182: wearing, as the work of herself and of her maids; s'she said,
LINE 183: "Stranger, before we g'any further, there is a question I should like
LINE 184: t'ask you. Who, and whence are you, and wh'gave you those clothes?
LINE 185: Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?"
LINE 186: And Ulysses answered, "It would be a long story Madam, were I t'relate
LINE 187: in full the tale of my misfortunes, for the hand of heaven has been
LINE 188: laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question, there is an island
LINE 189: far away in the sea which is called 'the Ogygian.' Here dwells the
LINE 190: cunning and powerful goddess Calypso, daughter of Atlas. She lives by
LINE 191: herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune, however,
LINE 192: brought me t'her hearth all desolate and alone, for Jove struck my
LINE 193: ship with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave
LINE 194: comrades were drowned every man of them, but I stuck t'the keel and
LINE 195: was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days, till at last
LINE 196: during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me t'the
LINE 197: Ogygian island where the great goddess Calyps'lives. She took me in
LINE 198: and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted t'make me
LINE 199: immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not persuade me to
LINE 200: let her d'so.
LINE 201: "I stayed with Calyps'seven years straight on end, and watered the
LINE 202: good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at
LINE 203: last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free
LINE 204: will, either because Jove had told her she must, or because she had
LINE 205: changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft, which she
LINE 206: provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good
LINE 207: stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days
LINE 208: seven and ten did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I caught
LINE 209: sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast—and glad
LINE 210: indeed was I t'set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much
LINE 211: trouble in store for me, for at this point Neptune would let me g'no
LINE 212: further, and raised a great storm against me; the sea was s'terribly
LINE 213: high that I could n'longer keep t'my raft, which went t'pieces under
LINE 214: the fury of the gale, and I had t'swim for it, till wind and current
LINE 215: brought me t'your shores.
LINE 216: "There I tried t'land, but could not, for it was a bad place and the
LINE 217: waves dashed me against the rocks, s'I again took t'the sea and swam
LINE 218: on till I came t'a river that seemed the most likely landing place,
LINE 219: for there were n'rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then,
LINE 220: I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was
LINE 221: coming on, s'I left the river, and went int'a thicket, where I
LINE 222: covered myself all over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off
LINE 223: int'a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the
LINE 224: leaves all night, and through the next day till afternoon, when I woke
LINE 225: as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's maid servants playing
LINE 226: upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I
LINE 227: besought her aid, and she proved t'be of an excellent disposition,
LINE 228: much more s'than could be expected from s'young a person—for young
LINE 229: people are apt t'be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,
LINE 230: and when she had had me washed in the river she als'gave me the
LINE 231: clothes in which you see me. Now, therefore, though it has pained me to
LINE 232: d'so, I have told you the whole truth."
LINE 233: Then Alcinous said, "Stranger, it was very wrong of my daughter not to
LINE 234: bring you on at once t'my house along with the maids, seeing that she
LINE 235: was the first person whose aid you asked."
LINE 236: "Pray d'not scold her," replied Ulysses; "she is not t'blame. She did
LINE 237: tell me t'follow along with the maids, but I was ashamed and afraid,
LINE 238: for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every
LINE 239: human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable."
LINE 240: "Stranger," replied Alcinous, "I am not the kind of man t'get angry
LINE 241: about nothing; it is always better t'be reasonable; but by Father
LINE 242: Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, now that I see what kind of person you are,
LINE 243: and how much you think as I do, I wish you would stay here, marry my
LINE 244: daughter, and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a
LINE 245: house and an estate, but n'one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here
LINE 246: against your own wish, and that you may be sure of this I will attend
LINE 247: tomorrow t'the matter of your escort. You can sleep64 during the whole
LINE 248: voyage if you like, and the men shall sail you over smooth waters
LINE 249: either t'your own home, or wherever you please, even though it be a
LINE 250: long way further off than Euboea, which those of my people wh'saw it
LINE 251: when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus t'see Tityus the son of
LINE 252: Gaia, tell me is the furthest of any place—and yet they did the whole
LINE 253: voyage in a single day without distressing themselves, and came back
LINE 254: again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others,
LINE 255: and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are."
LINE 256: Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying, "Father Jove, grant that
LINE 257: Alcinous may d'all as he has said, for s'he will win an imperishable
LINE 258: name among mankind, and at the same time I shall return t'my country."
LINE 259: Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids t'set a bed in the
LINE 260: room that was in the gatehouse, and make it with good red rugs, and to
LINE 261: spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to
LINE 262: wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands, and when
LINE 263: they had made the bed they came up t'Ulysses and said, "Rise, sir
LINE 264: stranger, and come with us for your bed is ready," and glad indeed was
LINE 265: he t'g't'his rest.
LINE 266: S'Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;
LINE 267: but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house, with the queen his
LINE 268: wife by his side.
