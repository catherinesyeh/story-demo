LINE 1: THE TRIAL OF THE AXES, DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF T'EUMAEUS
LINE 2: AND PHILOETIUS
LINE 3: Minerva now put it in Penelope's mind t'make the suitors try their
LINE 4: skill with the bow and with the iron axes, in contest among themselves,
LINE 5: as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and
LINE 6: got the store-room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of
LINE 7: ivory; she then went with her maidens int'the store-room at the end of
LINE 8: the house, where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought
LINE 9: iron were kept, and where was als'his bow, and the quiver full of
LINE 10: deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in
LINE 11: Lacedaemon—Iphitus the son of Eurytus. The tw'fell in with one another
LINE 12: in Messene at the house of Ortilochus, where Ulysses was staying in
LINE 13: order t'recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the
LINE 14: Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca, and had
LINE 15: sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these
LINE 16: Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young, for his father and
LINE 17: the other chieftains sent him on a mission t'recover them. Iphitus had
LINE 18: gone there als't'try and get back twelve brood mares that he had
LINE 19: lost, and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were
LINE 20: the death of him in the end, for when he went t'the house of Jove's
LINE 21: son, mighty Hercules, wh'performed such prodigies of valour, Hercules
LINE 22: t'his shame killed him, though he was his guest, for he feared not
LINE 23: heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his own table which he had set
LINE 24: before Iphitus, but killed him in spite of everything, and kept the
LINE 25: mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses, and
LINE 26: gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used t'carry, and which
LINE 27: on his death had been left by him t'his son. Ulysses gave him in
LINE 28: return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast
LINE 29: friendship, although they never visited at one another's houses, for
LINE 30: Jove's son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could d'so. This bow,
LINE 31: then, given him by Iphitus, had not been taken with him by Ulysses when
LINE 32: he sailed for Troy; he had used it s'long as he had been at home, but
LINE 33: had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.
LINE 34: Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the
LINE 35: carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it s'as t'get
LINE 36: it quite straight; he had then set the door posts int'it and hung the
LINE 37: doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the
LINE 38: key, and drove it straight home t'shoot back the bolts that held the
LINE 39: doors;161 these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a
LINE 40: meadow, and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform, where the chests
LINE 41: stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with
LINE 42: fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down the bow with its bow
LINE 43: case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,
LINE 44: weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when her
LINE 45: tears had relieved her, she went t'the cloister where the suitors
LINE 46: were, carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that
LINE 47: were inside it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that
LINE 48: contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.
LINE 49: When she reached the suitors, she stood by one of the bearing-posts
LINE 50: supporting the roof of the cloister, holding a veil before her face,
LINE 51: and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:
LINE 52: "Listen t'me you suitors, wh'persist in abusing the hospitality of
LINE 53: this house because its owner has been long absent, and without other
LINE 54: pretext than that you want t'marry me; this, then, being the prize
LINE 55: that you are contending for, I will bring out the mighty bow of
LINE 56: Ulysses, and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his
LINE 57: arrow through each one of twelve axes, him will I follow and quit this
LINE 58: house of my lawful husband, s'goodly, and s'abounding in wealth. But
LINE 59: even s'I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams."
LINE 60: As she spoke, she told Eumaeus t'set the bow and the pieces of iron
LINE 61: before the suitors, and Eumaeus wept as he took them t'd'as she had
LINE 62: bidden him. Hard by, the stockman wept als'when he saw his master's
LINE 63: bow, but Antinous scolded them. "You country louts," said he, "silly
LINE 64: simpletons; why should you add t'the sorrows of your mistress by
LINE 65: crying in this way? She has enough t'grieve her in the loss of her
LINE 66: husband; sit still, therefore, and eat your dinners in silence, or go
LINE 67: outside if you want t'cry, and leave the bow behind you. We suitors
LINE 68: shall have t'contend for it with might and main, for we shall find it
LINE 69: n'light matter t'string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of
LINE 70: us all wh'is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember
LINE 71: him, though I was then only a child."
LINE 72: This was what he said, but all the time he was expecting t'be able to
LINE 73: string the bow and shoot through the iron, whereas in fact he was t'be
LINE 74: the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,
LINE 75: whom he was dishonouring in his own house—egging the others on t'd'so
LINE 76: also.
LINE 77: Then Telemachus spoke. "Great heavens!" he exclaimed, "Jove must have
LINE 78: robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she
LINE 79: will quit this house and marry again, yet I am laughing and enjoying
LINE 80: myself as though there were nothing happening. But, suitors, as the
LINE 81: contest has been agreed upon, let it g'forward. It is for a woman
LINE 82: whose peer is not t'be found in Pylos, Argos, or Mycene, nor yet in
LINE 83: Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need
LINE 84: have I t'speak in praise of my mother? Come on, then, make n'excuses
LINE 85: for delay, but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too
LINE 86: will make trial of it, for if I can string it and shoot through the
LINE 87: iron, I shall not suffer my mother t'quit this house with a stranger,
LINE 88: not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me."
LINE 89: As he spoke he sprang from his seat, threw his crimson cloak from him,
LINE 90: and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row,
LINE 91: in a long groove which he had dug for them, and had made straight by
LINE 92: line.162 Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was
LINE 93: surprised when they saw him set them up s'orderly, though he had never
LINE 94: seen anything of the kind before. This done, he went on t'the pavement
LINE 95: t'make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it, trying with all his
LINE 96: might t'draw the string, and thrice he had t'leave off, though he had
LINE 97: hoped t'string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for
LINE 98: the fourth time, and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign
LINE 99: t'check him in spite of all his eagerness. S'he said:
LINE 100: "Alas! I shall either be always feeble and of n'prowess, or I am too
LINE 101: young, and have not yet reached my full strength s'as t'be able to
LINE 102: hold my own if any one attacks me. You others, therefore, wh'are
LINE 103: stronger than I, make trial of the bow and get this contest settled."
LINE 104: On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door [that led
LINE 105: int'the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.
LINE 106: Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and Antinous
LINE 107: said:
LINE 108: "Come on each of you in his turn, going towards the right from the
LINE 109: place at which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine."
LINE 110: The rest agreed, and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first t'rise. He
LINE 111: was sacrificial priest t'the suitors, and sat in the corner near the
LINE 112: mixing-bowl. 163 He was the only man wh'hated their evil deeds and was
LINE 113: indignant with the others. He was now the first t'take the bow and
LINE 114: arrow, s'he went on t'the pavement t'make his trial, but he could
LINE 115: not string the bow, for his hands were weak and unused t'hard work,
LINE 116: they therefore soon grew tired, and he said t'the suitors, "My
LINE 117: friends, I cannot string it; let another have it, this bow shall take
LINE 118: the life and soul out of many a chief among us, for it is better t'die
LINE 119: than t'live after having missed the prize that we have s'long striven
LINE 120: for, and which has brought us s'long together. Some one of us is even
LINE 121: now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope, but when he has seen
LINE 122: this bow and tried it, let him wo'and make bridal offerings t'some
LINE 123: other woman, and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer
LINE 124: and whose lot it is t'win her."
LINE 125: On this he put the bow down, letting it lean against the door,164 with
LINE 126: the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat
LINE 127: again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him
LINE 128: saying:
LINE 129: "Leiodes, what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and
LINE 130: intolerable; it makes me angry t'listen t'you. Shall, then, this bow
LINE 131: take the life of many a chief among us, merely because you cannot bend
LINE 132: it yourself? True, you were not born t'be an archer, but there are
LINE 133: others wh'will soon string it."
LINE 134: Then he said t'Melanthius the goatherd, "Look sharp, light a fire in
LINE 135: the court, and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us
LINE 136: als'a large ball of lard, from what they have in the house. Let us
LINE 137: warm the bow and grease it—we will then make trial of it again, and
LINE 138: bring the contest t'an end."
LINE 139: Melanthius lit the fire, and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside
LINE 140: it. He als'brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the
LINE 141: house, and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it, but
LINE 142: they were none of them nearly strong enough t'string it. Nevertheless
LINE 143: there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus, wh'were the ringleaders
LINE 144: among the suitors and much the foremost among them all.
LINE 145: Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together, and
LINE 146: Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the
LINE 147: outer yard, Ulysses said t'them quietly:
LINE 148: "Stockman, and you swineherd, I have something in my mind which I am in
LINE 149: doubt whether t'say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of
LINE 150: men would you be t'stand by Ulysses, if some god should bring him back
LINE 151: here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed t'do—t'side with the
LINE 152: suitors, or with Ulysses?"
LINE 153: "Father Jove," answered the stockman, "would indeed that you might so
LINE 154: ordain it. If some god were but t'bring Ulysses back, you should see
LINE 155: with what might and main I would fight for him."
LINE 156: In like words Eumaeus prayed t'all the gods that Ulysses might return;
LINE 157: when, therefore, he saw for certain what mind they were of, Ulysses
LINE 158: said, "It is I, Ulysses, wh'am here. I have suffered much, but at
LINE 159: last, in the twentieth year, I am come back t'my own country. I find
LINE 160: that you tw'alone of all my servants are glad that I should d'so, for
LINE 161: I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. T'you two,
LINE 162: therefore, will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall
LINE 163: deliver the suitors int'my hands, I will find wives for both of you,
LINE 164: will give you house and holding close t'my own, and you shall be t'me
LINE 165: as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give
LINE 166: you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See, here is
LINE 167: the scar from the boar's tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on
LINE 168: Mt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus."
LINE 169: As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar, and when they
LINE 170: had examined it thoroughly, they both of them wept about Ulysses, threw
LINE 171: their arms round him, and kissed his head and shoulders, while Ulysses
LINE 172: kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down
LINE 173: upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:
LINE 174: "Cease your weeping, lest some one should come outside and see us, and
LINE 175: tell those wh'are within. When you g'in, d's'separately, not both
LINE 176: together; I will g'first, and d'you follow afterwards; let this
LINE 177: moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to
LINE 178: prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; d'you, therefore,
LINE 179: Eumaeus, place it in my hands when you are carrying it about, and tell
LINE 180: the women t'close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any
LINE 181: groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house, they must not
LINE 182: come out; they must keep quiet, and stay where they are at their work.
LINE 183: And I charge you, Philoetius, t'make fast the doors of the outer
LINE 184: court, and t'bind them securely at once."
LINE 185: When he had thus spoken, he went back t'the house and took the seat
LINE 186: that he had left. Presently, his tw'servants followed him inside.
LINE 187: At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus, wh'was warming
LINE 188: it by the fire, but even s'he could not string it, and he was greatly
LINE 189: grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said, "I grieve for myself and for
LINE 190: us all; I grieve that I shall have t'forg'the marriage, but I d'not
LINE 191: care nearly s'much about this, for there are plenty of other women in
LINE 192: Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so
LINE 193: inferior t'Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This
LINE 194: will disgrace us in the eyes of those wh'are yet unborn."
LINE 195: "It shall not be so, Eurymachus," said Antinous, "and you know it
LINE 196: yourself. Today is the feast of Apoll'throughout all the land; wh'can
LINE 197: string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side—as for the axes
LINE 198: they can stay where they are, for n'one is likely t'come t'the house
LINE 199: and take them away: let the cupbearer g'round with his cups, that we
LINE 200: may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will
LINE 201: tell Melanthius t'bring us in some goats tomorrow—the best he has; we
LINE 202: can then offer thigh bones t'Apoll'the mighty archer, and again make
LINE 203: trial of the bow, s'as t'bring the contest t'an end."
LINE 204: The rest approved his words, and thereon men servants poured water over
LINE 205: the hands of the guests, while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine
LINE 206: and water and handed it round after giving every man his
LINE 207: drink-offering. Then, when they had made their offerings and had drunk
LINE 208: each as much as he desired, Ulysses craftily said:—
LINE 209: "Suitors of the illustrious queen, listen that I may speak even as I am
LINE 210: minded. I appeal more especially t'Eurymachus, and t'Antinous wh'has
LINE 211: just spoken with s'much reason. Cease shooting for the present and
LINE 212: leave the matter t'the gods, but in the morning let heaven give
LINE 213: victory t'whom it will. For the moment, however, give me the bow that
LINE 214: I may prove the power of my hands among you all, and see whether I
LINE 215: still have as much strength as I used t'have, or whether travel and
LINE 216: neglect have made an end of it."
LINE 217: This made them all very angry, for they feared he might string the bow,
LINE 218: Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying, "Wretched creature, you
LINE 219: have not s'much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to
LINE 220: think yourself lucky in being allowed t'dine unharmed among your
LINE 221: betters, without having any smaller portion served you than we others
LINE 222: have had, and in being allowed t'hear our conversation. N'other
LINE 223: beggar or stranger has been allowed t'hear what we say among
LINE 224: ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief, as it does
LINE 225: with all those wh'drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the
LINE 226: Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the
LINE 227: Lapithae. When the wine had got int'his head, he went mad and did ill
LINE 228: deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes wh'were
LINE 229: there assembled, s'they rushed at him and cut off his ears and
LINE 230: nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house,
LINE 231: s'he went away crazed, and bore the burden of his crime, bereft of
LINE 232: understanding. Henceforth, therefore, there was war between mankind and
LINE 233: the centaurs, but he brought it upon himself through his own
LINE 234: drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will g'hardly with
LINE 235: you if you string the bow: you will find n'mercy from any one here,
LINE 236: for we shall at once ship you off t'king Echetus, wh'kills every one
LINE 237: that comes near him: you will never get away alive, s'drink and keep
LINE 238: quiet without getting int'a quarrel with men younger than yourself."
LINE 239: Penelope then spoke t'him. "Antinous," said she, "it is not right that
LINE 240: you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus wh'comes t'this house.
LINE 241: If the stranger should prove strong enough t'string the mighty bow of
LINE 242: Ulysses, can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make
LINE 243: me his wife? Even the man himself can have n'such idea in his mind:
LINE 244: none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all
LINE 245: reason."
LINE 246: "Queen Penelope," answered Eurymachus, "we d'not suppose that this man
LINE 247: will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest
LINE 248: some of the baser sort, men or women among the Achaeans, should go
LINE 249: gossiping about and say, 'These suitors are a feeble folk; they are
LINE 250: paying court t'the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was
LINE 251: able t'string, and yet a beggarly tramp wh'came t'the house strung
LINE 252: it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.' This is what will be
LINE 253: said, and it will be a scandal against us."
LINE 254: "Eurymachus," Penelope answered, "people wh'persist in eating up the
LINE 255: estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect
LINE 256: others t'think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as
LINE 257: you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built, he says
LINE 258: moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow, and let us see
LINE 259: whether he can string it or no. I say—and it shall surely be—that if
LINE 260: Apoll'vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it, I will give him a
LINE 261: cloak and shirt of good wear, with a javelin t'keep off dogs and
LINE 262: robbers, and a sharp sword. I will als'give him sandals, and will see
LINE 263: him sent safely wherever he wants t'go."
LINE 264: Then Telemachus said, "Mother, I am the only man either in Ithaca or in
LINE 265: the islands that are over against Elis wh'has the right t'let any one
LINE 266: have the bow or t'refuse it. N'one shall force me one way or the
LINE 267: other, not even though I choose t'make the stranger a present of the
LINE 268: bow outright, and let him take it away with him. Go, then, within the
LINE 269: house and busy yourself with your daily duties, your loom, your
LINE 270: distaff, and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man's matter,
LINE 271: and mine above all others, for it is I wh'am master here."
LINE 272: She went wondering back int'the house, and laid her son's saying in
LINE 273: her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids int'her room, she
LINE 274: mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her
LINE 275: eyelids.
LINE 276: The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it t'Ulysses, but
LINE 277: the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters, and one
LINE 278: of them said, "You idiot, where are you taking the bow to? Are you out
LINE 279: of your wits? If Apoll'and the other gods will grant our prayer, your
LINE 280: own boarhounds shall get you int'some quiet little place, and worry
LINE 281: you t'death."
LINE 282: Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised, s'he put the bow
LINE 283: down then and there, but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other
LINE 284: side of the cloisters, and threatened him saying, "Father Eumaeus,
LINE 285: bring the bow on in spite of them, or young as I am I will pelt you
LINE 286: with stones back t'the country, for I am the better man of the two. I
LINE 287: wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as
LINE 288: I am than you, I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry, for
LINE 289: they mean mischief."
LINE 290: Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily, which put
LINE 291: them in a better humour with Telemachus; s'Eumaeus brought the bow on
LINE 292: and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this, he called
LINE 293: Euryclea apart and said t'her, "Euryclea, Telemachus says you are to
LINE 294: close the doors of the women's apartments. If they hear any groaning or
LINE 295: uproar as of men fighting about the house, they are not t'come out,
LINE 296: but are t'keep quiet and stay where they are at their work."
LINE 297: Euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women's
LINE 298: apartments.
LINE 299: Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the
LINE 300: outer court. There was a ship's cable of byblus fibre lying in the
LINE 301: gatehouse, s'he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,
LINE 302: resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Ulysses, who
LINE 303: had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about,
LINE 304: and proving it all over t'see whether the worms had been eating into
LINE 305: its tw'horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his
LINE 306: neighbour saying, "This is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has
LINE 307: got one like it at home, or he wants t'make one, in such workmanlike
LINE 308: style does the old vagabond handle it."
LINE 309: Another said, "I hope he may be n'more successful in other things than
LINE 310: he is likely t'be in stringing this bow."
LINE 311: But Ulysses, when he had taken it up and examined it all over, strung
LINE 312: it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes
LINE 313: the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to
LINE 314: prove the string, and it sang sweetly under his touch like the
LINE 315: twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed, and turned colour
LINE 316: as they heard it; at that moment, moreover, Jove thundered loudly as a
LINE 317: sign, and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the
LINE 318: son of scheming Saturn had sent him.
LINE 319: He took an arrow that was lying upon the table165—for those which the
LINE 320: Achaeans were s'shortly about t'taste were all inside the quiver—he
LINE 321: laid it on the centre-piece of the bow, and drew the notch of the arrow
LINE 322: and the string toward him, still seated on his seat. When he had taken
LINE 323: aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of
LINE 324: the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them,
LINE 325: and int'the outer courtyard. Then he said t'Telemachus:
LINE 326: "Your guest has not disgraced you, Telemachus. I did not miss what I
LINE 327: aimed at, and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,
LINE 328: and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now, however, it is time for
LINE 329: the Achaeans t'prepare supper while there is still daylight, and then
LINE 330: otherwise t'disport themselves with song and dance which are the
LINE 331: crowning ornaments of a banquet."
LINE 332: As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows, and Telemachus girded on
LINE 333: his sword, grasped his spear, and stood armed beside his father's seat.
