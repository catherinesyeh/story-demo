LINE 1: AEOLUS, THE LAESTRYGONES, CIRCE.
LINE 2: "Thence we went on t'the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of
LINE 3: Hippotas, dear t'the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it
LINE 4: were) upon the sea,83 iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now, Aeolus
LINE 5: has six daughters and six lusty sons, s'he made the sons marry the
LINE 6: daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,
LINE 7: feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long
LINE 8: the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats
LINE 9: till it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their
LINE 10: well made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These
LINE 11: were the people among whom we had now come.
LINE 12: "Aeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the
LINE 13: time about Troy, the Argive fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I
LINE 14: told him exactly how everything had happened, and when I said I must
LINE 15: go, and asked him t'further me on my way, he made n'sort of
LINE 16: difficulty, but set about doing s'at once. Moreover, he flayed me a
LINE 17: prime ox-hide t'hold the ways of the roaring winds, which he shut up
LINE 18: in the hide as in a sack—for Jove had made him captain over the winds,
LINE 19: and he could stir or still each one of them according t'his own
LINE 20: pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth s'tightly
LINE 21: with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow
LINE 22: from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let
LINE 23: blow as it chose; but it all came t'nothing, for we were lost through
LINE 24: our own folly.
LINE 25: "Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on the tenth day our native
LINE 26: land showed on the horizon. We got s'close in that we could see the
LINE 27: stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead beat, fell int'a light
LINE 28: sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we
LINE 29: might get home the faster. On this the men fell t'talking among
LINE 30: themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack
LINE 31: that Aeolus had given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one turn t'his
LINE 32: neighbour, saying, 'how this man gets honoured and makes friends to
LINE 33: whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking
LINE 34: home from Troy, while we, wh'have travelled just as far as he has,
LINE 35: come back with hands as empty as we set out with—and now Aeolus has
LINE 36: given him ever s'much more. Quick—let us see what it all is, and how
LINE 37: much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.'
LINE 38: "Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,
LINE 39: whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried
LINE 40: us weeping out t'sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and
LINE 41: knew not whether t'throw myself int'the sea or t'live on and make
LINE 42: the best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the
LINE 43: ship, while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our
LINE 44: fleet back t'the Aeolian island.
LINE 45: "When we reached it we went ashore t'take in water, and dined hard by
LINE 46: the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men
LINE 47: and went straight t'the house of Aeolus, where I found him feasting
LINE 48: with his wife and family; s'we sat down as suppliants on the
LINE 49: threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses,
LINE 50: what brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great
LINE 51: pains t'further you on your way home t'Ithaca, or wherever it was
LINE 52: that you wanted t'g'to.'
LINE 53: "Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My men have undone
LINE 54: me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends, mend me this
LINE 55: mischief, for you can if you will.'
LINE 56: "I spoke as movingly as I could, but they said nothing, till their
LINE 57: father answered, 'Vilest of mankind, get you gone at once out of the
LINE 58: island; him whom heaven hates will I in n'wise help. Be off, for you
LINE 59: come here as one abhorred of heaven.' And with these words he sent me
LINE 60: sorrowing from his door.
LINE 61: "Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and
LINE 62: fruitless rowing, for there was n'longer any wind t'help them. Six
LINE 63: days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the
LINE 64: rocky stronghold of Lamus—Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,
LINE 65: where the shepherd wh'is driving in his sheep and goats [t'be milked]
LINE 66: salutes him wh'is driving out his flock [t'feed] and this last
LINE 67: answers the salute. In that country a man wh'could d'without sleep
LINE 68: might earn double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a
LINE 69: shepherd, for they work much the same by night as they d'by day.84
LINE 70: "When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep
LINE 71: cliffs, with a narrow entrance between tw'headlands. My captains took
LINE 72: all their ships inside, and made them fast close t'one another, for
LINE 73: there was never s'much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always
LINE 74: dead calm. I kept my own ship outside, and moored it t'a rock at the
LINE 75: very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock t'reconnoitre, but
LINE 76: could see n'sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising
LINE 77: from the ground. S'I sent tw'of my company with an attendant t'find
LINE 78: out what sort of people the inhabitants were.
LINE 79: "The men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the
LINE 80: people draw their firewood from the mountains int'the town, till
LINE 81: presently they met a young woman wh'had come outside t'fetch water,
LINE 82: and wh'was daughter t'a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going
LINE 83: t'the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and
LINE 84: when my men had come close up t'her, they asked her wh'the king of
LINE 85: that country might be, and over what kind of people he ruled; s'she
LINE 86: directed them t'her father's house, but when they got there they found
LINE 87: his wife t'be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and they were
LINE 88: horrified at the sight of her.
LINE 89: "She at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,
LINE 90: and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,
LINE 91: and began t'make his dinner off him then and there, whereon the other
LINE 92: tw'ran back t'the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates
LINE 93: raised a hue-and-cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians
LINE 94: sprang up from every quarter—ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at
LINE 95: us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the
LINE 96: horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another, and the
LINE 97: death cries of my men, as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes
LINE 98: and took them home t'eat them. While they were thus killing my men
LINE 99: within the harbour I drew my sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and
LINE 100: told my men t'row with all their might if they to'would not fare like
LINE 101: the rest; s'they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful enough
LINE 102: when we got int'open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at
LINE 103: us. As for the others there was not one of them left.
LINE 104: "Thence we sailed sadly on, glad t'have escaped death, though we had
LINE 105: lost our comrades, and came t'the Aeaean island, where Circe lives—a
LINE 106: great and cunning goddess wh'is own sister t'the magician Aeetes—for
LINE 107: they are both children of the sun by Perse, wh'is daughter t'Oceanus.
LINE 108: We brought our ship int'a safe harbour without a word, for some god
LINE 109: guided us thither, and having landed we lay there for tw'days and two
LINE 110: nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day
LINE 111: came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to
LINE 112: reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or
LINE 113: hear the sound of voices. Climbing t'the top of a high look-out I
LINE 114: espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense forest of
LINE 115: trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the smoke, I
LINE 116: would not g'on at once and find out more, but in the end I deemed it
LINE 117: best t'g'back t'the ship, give the men their dinners, and send some
LINE 118: of them instead of going myself.
LINE 119: "When I had nearly got back t'the ship some god took pity upon my
LINE 120: solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right int'the middle of my
LINE 121: path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest t'drink of the
LINE 122: river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him
LINE 123: in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean
LINE 124: through him, and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of
LINE 125: him. Then I set my foot upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and
LINE 126: laid it down; I als'gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them
LINE 127: int'a fathom or s'of good stout rope, with which I bound the four
LINE 128: feet of the noble creature together; having s'done I hung him round my
LINE 129: neck and walked back t'the ship leaning upon my spear, for the stag
LINE 130: was much to'big for me t'be able t'carry him on my shoulder,
LINE 131: steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship,
LINE 132: I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man t'each of them. 'Look
LINE 133: here my friends,' said I, 'we are not going t'die s'much before our
LINE 134: time after all, and at any rate we will not starve s'long as we have
LINE 135: got something t'eat and drink on board.' On this they uncovered their
LINE 136: heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag, for he was indeed a
LINE 137: splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their eyes upon him
LINE 138: sufficiently, they washed their hands and began t'cook him for dinner.
LINE 139: "Thus through the livelong day t'the going down of the sun we stayed
LINE 140: there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went down and it
LINE 141: came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,
LINE 142: rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, 'My friends,
LINE 143: we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore t'me. We have no
LINE 144: idea where the sun either sets or rises,85 s'that we d'not even know
LINE 145: East from West. I see n'way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and
LINE 146: find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high as I could
LINE 147: this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it t'the horizon; it
LINE 148: lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick
LINE 149: forest of trees.'
LINE 150: "Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they remembered how they had
LINE 151: been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by the savage ogre
LINE 152: Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was nothing
LINE 153: t'be got by crying, s'I divided them int'tw'companies and set a
LINE 154: captain over each; I gave one company t'Eurylochus, while I took
LINE 155: command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot
LINE 156: fell upon Eurylochus; s'he set out with his twenty-tw'men, and they
LINE 157: wept, as als'did we wh'were left behind.
LINE 158: "When they reached Circe's house they found it built of cut stones, on
LINE 159: a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of the forest. There
LINE 160: were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it—poor
LINE 161: bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged
LINE 162: int'subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great
LINE 163: tails, fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against
LINE 164: them.86 As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming
LINE 165: from dinner—for they know he will bring them something—even s'did
LINE 166: these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men, but the
LINE 167: men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.
LINE 168: Presently they reached the gates of the goddess's house, and as they
LINE 169: stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as
LINE 170: she worked at her loom, making a web s'fine, s'soft, and of such
LINE 171: dazzling colours as n'one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites,
LINE 172: whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men, said, 'There
LINE 173: is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the
LINE 174: whole place resounds with it, let us call her and see whether she is
LINE 175: woman or goddess.'
LINE 176: "They called her and she came down, unfastened the door, and bade them
LINE 177: enter. They, thinking n'evil, followed her, all except Eurylochus, who
LINE 178: suspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them int'her
LINE 179: house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with
LINE 180: cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine, but she drugged it with wicked
LINE 181: poisons t'make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she
LINE 182: turned them int'pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her
LINE 183: pig-styes. They were like pigs—head, hair, and all, and they grunted
LINE 184: just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before, and they
LINE 185: remembered everything.
LINE 186: "Thus then were they shut up squealing, and Circe threw them some
LINE 187: acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylochus hurried back to
LINE 188: tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was s'overcome with
LINE 189: dismay that though he tried t'speak he could find n'words t'd'so;
LINE 190: his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last
LINE 191: we forced his story out of him, and he told us what had happened t'the
LINE 192: others.
LINE 193: "'We went,' said he, 'as you told us, through the forest, and in the
LINE 194: middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place
LINE 195: that could be seen from far. There we found a woman, or else she was a
LINE 196: goddess, working at her loom and singing sweetly; s'the men shouted to
LINE 197: her and called her, whereon she at once came down, opened the door, and
LINE 198: invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief s'they followed
LINE 199: her int'the house, but I staid where I was, for I thought there might
LINE 200: be some treachery. From that moment I saw them n'more, for not one of
LINE 201: them ever came out, though I sat a long time watching for them.'
LINE 202: "Then I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also
LINE 203: took my bow, and told Eurylochus t'come back with me and shew me the
LINE 204: way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,
LINE 205: saying, 'Sir, d'not force me t'g'with you, but let me stay here, for
LINE 206: I know you will not bring one of them back with you, nor even return
LINE 207: alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with
LINE 208: the few that are left us, for we may still save our lives.'
LINE 209: "'Stay where you are, then,' answered I, 'eating and drinking at the
LINE 210: ship, but I must go, for I am most urgently bound t'd'so.'
LINE 211: "With this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the
LINE 212: charmed grove, and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe, I
LINE 213: met Mercury with his golden wand, disguised as a young man in the
LINE 214: hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his
LINE 215: face. He came up t'me and took my hand within his own, saying, 'My
LINE 216: poor unhappy man, whither are you going over this mountain top, alone
LINE 217: and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe's pigstyes,
LINE 218: like s'many wild boars in their lairs. You surely d'not fancy that
LINE 219: you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and
LINE 220: will have t'stay there with the rest of them. But never mind, I will
LINE 221: protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb, which
LINE 222: is one of great virtue, and keep it about you when you g't'Circe's
LINE 223: house, it will be a talisman t'you against every kind of mischief.
LINE 224: "'And I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try
LINE 225: t'practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you t'drink, and she
LINE 226: will drug the meal with which she makes it, but she will not be able to
LINE 227: charm you, for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will
LINE 228: prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it. When
LINE 229: Circe strikes you with her wand, draw your sword and spring upon her as
LINE 230: though you were going t'kill her. She will then be frightened, and
LINE 231: will desire you t'g't'bed with her; on this you must not point blank
LINE 232: refuse her, for you want her t'set your companions free, and t'take
LINE 233: good care als'of yourself, but you must make her swear solemnly by all
LINE 234: the blessed gods that she will plot n'further mischief against you, or
LINE 235: else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for
LINE 236: nothing.'
LINE 237: "As he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it
LINE 238: was like. The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk;
LINE 239: the gods call it Moly, and mortal men cannot uproot it, but the gods
LINE 240: can d'whatever they like.
LINE 241: "Then Mercury went back t'high Olympus passing over the wooded island;
LINE 242: but I fared onward t'the house of Circe, and my heart was clouded with
LINE 243: care as I walked along. When I got t'the gates I stood there and
LINE 244: called the goddess, and as soon as she heard me she came down, opened
LINE 245: the door, and asked me t'come in; s'I followed her—much troubled in
LINE 246: my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver,
LINE 247: there was a footstool als'under my feet, and she mixed a mess in a
LINE 248: golden goblet for me t'drink; but she drugged it, for she meant me
LINE 249: mischief. When she had given it me, and I had drunk it without its
LINE 250: charming me, she struck me with her wand. 'There now,' she cried, 'be
LINE 251: off t'the pigstye, and make your lair with the rest of them.'
LINE 252: "But I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,
LINE 253: whereon she fell with a loud scream, clasped my knees, and spoke
LINE 254: piteously, saying, 'Wh'and whence are you? from what place and people
LINE 255: have you come? How can it be that my drugs have n'power t'charm you?
LINE 256: Never yet was any man able t'stand s'much as a taste of the herb I
LINE 257: gave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than
LINE 258: the bold her'Ulysses, wh'Mercury always said would come here some day
LINE 259: with his ship while on his way home from Troy; s'be it then; sheathe
LINE 260: your sword and let us g't'bed, that we may make friends and learn to
LINE 261: trust each other.'
LINE 262: "And I answered, 'Circe, how can you expect me t'be friendly with you
LINE 263: when you have just been turning all my men int'pigs? And now that you
LINE 264: have got me here myself, you mean me mischief when you ask me t'g'to
LINE 265: bed with you, and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall
LINE 266: certainly not consent t'g't'bed with you unless you will first take
LINE 267: your solemn oath t'plot n'further harm against me.'
LINE 268: "S'she swore at once as I had told her, and when she had completed her
LINE 269: oath then I went t'bed with her.
LINE 270: "Meanwhile her four servants, wh'are her housemaids, set about their
LINE 271: work. They are the children of the groves and fountains, and of the
LINE 272: holy waters that run down int'the sea. One of them spread a fair
LINE 273: purple cloth over a seat, and laid a carpet underneath it. Another
LINE 274: brought tables of silver up t'the seats, and set them with baskets of
LINE 275: gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put
LINE 276: golden cups upon the tables, while the fourth brought in water and set
LINE 277: it t'boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted.
LINE 278: When the water in the cauldron was boiling,87 she poured cold int'it
LINE 279: till it was just as I liked it, and then she set me in a bath and began
LINE 280: washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders, t'take the
LINE 281: tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me
LINE 282: and anointing me with oil, she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and
LINE 283: led me t'a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a
LINE 284: footstool als'under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a
LINE 285: beautiful golden ewer and poured it int'a silver basin for me t'wash
LINE 286: my hands, and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant
LINE 287: brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the
LINE 288: house, and then Circe bade me eat, but I would not, and sat without
LINE 289: heeding what was before me, still moody and suspicious.
LINE 290: "When Circe saw me sitting there without eating, and in great grief,
LINE 291: she came t'me and said, 'Ulysses, why d'you sit like that as though
LINE 292: you were dumb, gnawing at your own heart, and refusing both meat and
LINE 293: drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not t'be, for I
LINE 294: have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.'
LINE 295: "And I said, 'Circe, n'man with any sense of what is right can think
LINE 296: of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his
LINE 297: friends free and let him see them. If you want me t'eat and drink, you
LINE 298: must free my men and bring them t'me that I may see them with my own
LINE 299: eyes.'
LINE 300: "When I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand
LINE 301: in her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like s'many
LINE 302: prime hogs and stood looking at her, but she went about among them and
LINE 303: anointed each with a second drug, whereon the bristles that the bad
LINE 304: drug had given them fell off, and they became men again, younger than
LINE 305: they were before, and much taller and better looking. They knew me at
LINE 306: once, seized me each of them by the hand, and wept for joy till the
LINE 307: whole house was filled with the sound of their halloa-ballooing, and
LINE 308: Circe herself was s'sorry for them that she came up t'me and said,
LINE 309: 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, g'back at once t'the sea where you
LINE 310: have left your ship, and first draw it on t'the land. Then, hide all
LINE 311: your ship's gear and property in some cave, and come back here with
LINE 312: your men.'
LINE 313: "I agreed t'this, s'I went back t'the sea shore, and found the men
LINE 314: at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the
LINE 315: silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out
LINE 316: and gambol round their mothers, when they see them coming home t'be
LINE 317: milked after they have been feeding all day, and the homestead resounds
LINE 318: with their lowing. They seemed as glad t'see me as though they had got
LINE 319: back t'their own rugged Ithaca, where they had been born and bred.
LINE 320: 'Sir,' said the affectionate creatures, 'we are as glad t'see you back
LINE 321: as though we had got safe home t'Ithaca; but tell us all about the
LINE 322: fate of our comrades.'
LINE 323: "I spoke comfortingly t'them and said, 'We must draw our ship on to
LINE 324: the land, and hide the ship's gear with all our property in some cave;
LINE 325: then come with me all of you as fast as you can t'Circe's house, where
LINE 326: you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great
LINE 327: abundance.'
LINE 328: "On this the men would have come with me at once, but Eurylochus tried
LINE 329: t'hold them back and said, 'Alas, poor wretches that we are, what will
LINE 330: become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going t'the house of Circe, who
LINE 331: will turn us all int'pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall have to
LINE 332: keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our
LINE 333: comrades went inside his cave, and Ulysses with them. It was all
LINE 334: through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.'
LINE 335: "When I heard him I was in tw'minds whether or n't'draw the keen
LINE 336: blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his
LINE 337: being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and
LINE 338: said, 'Sir, if it may s'be, let this fellow stay here and mind the
LINE 339: ship, but take the rest of us with you t'Circe's house.'
LINE 340: "On this we all went inland, and Eurylochus was not left behind after
LINE 341: all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe reprimand
LINE 342: that I had given him.
LINE 343: "Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men wh'had been left behind
LINE 344: were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had als'given them
LINE 345: woollen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all
LINE 346: comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other
LINE 347: face t'face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud
LINE 348: till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up t'me and said,
LINE 349: 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, tell your men t'leave off crying; I
LINE 350: know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill you have
LINE 351: fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so
LINE 352: stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and
LINE 353: hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are
LINE 354: weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the
LINE 355: hardships you have suffered during your travels, s'that you have no
LINE 356: more cheerfulness left in you.'
LINE 357: "Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole
LINE 358: twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But
LINE 359: when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had
LINE 360: come round, my men called me apart and said, 'Sir, it is time you began
LINE 361: t'think about going home, if s'be you are t'be spared t'see your
LINE 362: house and native country at all.'
LINE 363: "Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day
LINE 364: t'the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine, but
LINE 365: when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down
LINE 366: t'sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got int'bed
LINE 367: with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened t'what
LINE 368: I had got t'say. 'Circe,' said I, 'please t'keep the promise you made
LINE 369: me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want t'get back and so
LINE 370: d'my men, they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon
LINE 371: as ever your back is turned.'
LINE 372: "And the goddess answered, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, you shall
LINE 373: none of you stay here any longer if you d'not want to, but there is
LINE 374: another journey which you have got t'take before you can sail
LINE 375: homewards. You must g't'the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to
LINE 376: consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias, whose reason
LINE 377: is still unshaken. T'him alone has Proserpine left his understanding
LINE 378: even in death, but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.'
LINE 379: "I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept, and would
LINE 380: gladly have lived n'longer t'see the light of the sun, but presently
LINE 381: when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I said, 'And who
LINE 382: shall guide me upon this voyage—for the house of Hades is a port that
LINE 383: n'ship can reach.'
LINE 384: "'You will want n'guide,' she answered; 'raise your mast, set your
LINE 385: white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow you there of
LINE 386: itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus, you will
LINE 387: reach the fertile shore of Proserpine's country with its groves of tall
LINE 388: poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your
LINE 389: ship upon the shore of Oceanus, and g'straight on t'the dark abode of
LINE 390: Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon
LINE 391: and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow int'Acheron,
LINE 392: and you will see a rock near it, just where the tw'roaring rivers run
LINE 393: int'one another.
LINE 394: "'When you have reached this spot, as I now tell you, dig a trench a
LINE 395: cubit or s'in length, breadth, and depth, and pour int'it as a
LINE 396: drink-offering t'all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then
LINE 397: wine, and in the third place water—sprinkling white barley meal over
LINE 398: the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers t'the poor feeble
LINE 399: ghosts, and promise them that when you get back t'Ithaca you will
LINE 400: sacrifice a barren heifer t'them, the best you have, and will load the
LINE 401: pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that
LINE 402: Teiresias shall have a black sheep all t'himself, the finest in all
LINE 403: your flocks.
LINE 404: "'When you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers, offer
LINE 405: them a ram and a black ewe, bending their heads towards Erebus; but
LINE 406: yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the
LINE 407: river. On this, many dead men's ghosts will come t'you, and you must
LINE 408: tell your men t'skin the tw'sheep that you have just killed, and
LINE 409: offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers t'Hades and to
LINE 410: Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there, s'as t'prevent any
LINE 411: other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias
LINE 412: shall have answered your questions. The seer will presently come to
LINE 413: you, and will tell you about your voyage—what stages you are t'make,
LINE 414: and how you are t'sail the sea s'as t'reach your home.'
LINE 415: "It was day-break by the time she had done speaking, s'she dressed me
LINE 416: in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light
LINE 417: gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden girdle
LINE 418: round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went
LINE 419: about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to
LINE 420: each of them man by man: 'You must not lie sleeping here any longer,'
LINE 421: said I t'them, 'we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.'
LINE 422: And on this they did as I bade them.
LINE 423: "Even so, however, I did not get them away without misadventure. We had
LINE 424: with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very remarkable for sense or
LINE 425: courage, wh'had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the
LINE 426: rest of the men, t'sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the
LINE 427: noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and forgot
LINE 428: all about coming down by the main staircase, s'he tumbled right off
LINE 429: the roof and broke his neck, and his soul went down t'the house of
LINE 430: Hades.
LINE 431: "When I had got the men together I said t'them, 'You think you are
LINE 432: about t'start home again, but Circe has explained t'me that instead
LINE 433: of this, we have got t'g't'the house of Hades and Proserpine to
LINE 434: consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.'
LINE 435: "The men were broken-hearted as they heard me, and threw themselves on
LINE 436: the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they did not mend
LINE 437: matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and lamenting
LINE 438: our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast hard
LINE 439: by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,
LINE 440: for wh'can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not
LINE 441: wish t'be seen?
