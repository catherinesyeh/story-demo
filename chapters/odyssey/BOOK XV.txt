LINE 1: MINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON—HE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS
LINE 2: AT PYLOS AND BRINGS HIM T'ITHACA—ON LANDING HE GOES T'THE HUT OF
LINE 3: EUMAEUS.
LINE 4: But Minerva went t'the fair city of Lacedaemon t'tell Ulysses' son
LINE 5: that he was t'return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping
LINE 6: in the forecourt of Menelaus's house; Pisistratus was fast asleep, but
LINE 7: Telemachus could get n'rest all night for thinking of his unhappy
LINE 8: father, s'Minerva went close up t'him and said:
LINE 9: "Telemachus, you should not remain s'far away from home any longer,
LINE 10: nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they
LINE 11: will eat up everything you have among them, and you will have been on a
LINE 12: fool's errand. Ask Menelaus t'send you home at once if you wish to
LINE 13: find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father
LINE 14: and brothers are already urging her t'marry Eurymachus, wh'has given
LINE 15: her more than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his
LINE 16: wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the
LINE 17: house in spite of you, but you know what women are—they always want to
LINE 18: d'the best they can for the man wh'marries them, and never give
LINE 19: another thought t'the children of their first husband, nor t'their
LINE 20: father either when he is dead and done with. G'home, therefore, and
LINE 21: put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you
LINE 22: have, until it shall please heaven t'send you a wife of your own. Let
LINE 23: me tell you als'of another matter which you had better attend to. The
LINE 24: chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait128
LINE 25: between Ithaca and Samos, and they mean t'kill you before you can
LINE 26: reach home. I d'not much think they will succeed; it is more likely
LINE 27: that some of those wh'are now eating up your property will find a
LINE 28: grave themselves. Sail night and day, and keep your ship well away from
LINE 29: the islands; the god wh'watches over you and protects you will send
LINE 30: you a fair wind. As soon as you get t'Ithaca send your ship and men on
LINE 31: t'the town, but yourself g'straight t'the swineherd wh'has charge
LINE 32: of your pigs; he is well disposed towards you, stay with him,
LINE 33: therefore, for the night, and then send him t'Penelope t'tell her
LINE 34: that you have got back safe from Pylos."
LINE 35: Then she went back t'Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with
LINE 36: his heel t'rouse him, and said, "Wake up Pisistratus, and yoke the
LINE 37: horses t'the chariot, for we must set off home."129
LINE 38: But Pisistratus said, "N'matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive
LINE 39: in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought
LINE 40: his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good
LINE 41: bye t'us in the usual way. S'long as he lives a guest should never
LINE 42: forget a host wh'has shown him kindness."
LINE 43: As he spoke day began t'break, and Menelaus, wh'had already risen,
LINE 44: leaving Helen in bed, came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put
LINE 45: on his shirt as fast as he could, threw a great cloak over his
LINE 46: shoulders, and went out t'meet him. "Menelaus," said he, "let me go
LINE 47: back now t'my own country, for I want t'get home."
LINE 48: And Menelaus answered, "Telemachus, if you insist on going I will not
LINE 49: detain you. I d'not like t'see a host either to'fond of his guest or
LINE 50: to'rude t'him. Moderation is best in all things, and not letting a
LINE 51: man g'when he wants t'd's'is as bad as telling him t'g'if he
LINE 52: would like t'stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in
LINE 53: the house and speed him when he wants t'leave it. Wait, then, till I
LINE 54: can get your beautiful presents int'your chariot, and till you have
LINE 55: yourself seen them. I will tell the women t'prepare a sufficient
LINE 56: dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once
LINE 57: more proper and cheaper for you t'get your dinner before setting out
LINE 58: on such a long journey. If, moreover, you have a fancy for making a
LINE 59: tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese, I will yoke my horses, and will
LINE 60: conduct you myself through all our principal cities. N'one will send
LINE 61: us away empty handed; every one will give us something—a bronze tripod,
LINE 62: a couple of mules, or a gold cup."
LINE 63: "Menelaus," replied Telemachus, "I want t'g'home at once, for when I
LINE 64: came away I left my property without protection, and fear that while
LINE 65: looking for my father I shall come t'ruin myself, or find that
LINE 66: something valuable has been stolen during my absence."
LINE 67: When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to
LINE 68: prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At
LINE 69: this moment Eteoneus joined him, for he lived close by and had just got
LINE 70: up; s'Menelaus told him t'light the fire and cook some meat, which he
LINE 71: at once did. Then Menelaus went down int'his fragrant store room,130
LINE 72: not alone, but Helen went too, with Megapenthes. When he reached the
LINE 73: place where the treasures of his house were kept, he selected a double
LINE 74: cup, and told his son Megapenthes t'bring als'a silver mixing bowl.
LINE 75: Meanwhile Helen went t'the chest where she kept the lovely dresses
LINE 76: which she had made with her own hands, and took out one that was
LINE 77: largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered
LINE 78: like a star, and lay at the very bottom of the chest. 131 Then they all
LINE 79: came back through the house again till they got t'Telemachus, and
LINE 80: Menelaus said, "Telemachus, may Jove, the mighty husband of Juno, bring
LINE 81: you safely home according t'your desire. I will now present you with
LINE 82: the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a
LINE 83: mixing bowl of pure silver, except the rim, which is inlaid with gold,
LINE 84: and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a
LINE 85: present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on
LINE 86: my return home. I should like t'give it t'you."
LINE 87: With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,
LINE 88: while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before
LINE 89: him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.
LINE 90: "I too, my son," said she, "have something for you as a keepsake from
LINE 91: the hand of Helen; it is for your bride t'wear upon her wedding day.
LINE 92: Till then, get your dear mother t'keep it for you; thus may you go
LINE 93: back rejoicing t'your own country and t'your home."
LINE 94: S'saying she gave the robe over t'him and he received it gladly. Then
LINE 95: Pisistratus put the presents int'the chariot, and admired them all as
LINE 96: he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus int'the
LINE 97: house, and they both of them sat down t'table. A maid servant brought
LINE 98: them water in a beautiful golden ewer, and poured it int'a silver
LINE 99: basin for them t'wash their hands, and she drew a clean table beside
LINE 100: them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good
LINE 101: things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and
LINE 102: gave them each their portions, while Megapenthes poured out the wine.
LINE 103: Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,
LINE 104: but as soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink Telemachus and
LINE 105: Pisistratus yoked the horses, and took their places in the chariot.
LINE 106: They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing
LINE 107: gatehouse of the outer court, and Menelaus came after them with a
LINE 108: golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a
LINE 109: drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and
LINE 110: pledged them, saying, "Farewell t'both of you; see that you tell
LINE 111: Nestor how I have treated you, for he was as kind t'me as any father
LINE 112: could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy."
LINE 113: "We will be sure, sir," answered Telemachus, "t'tell him everything as
LINE 114: soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses
LINE 115: returned when I get back t'Ithaca, that I might tell him of the very
LINE 116: great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I
LINE 117: am taking with me."
LINE 118: As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand—an eagle with a
LINE 119: great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm
LINE 120: yard—and all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It
LINE 121: came quite close up t'them and flew away on their right hands in front
LINE 122: of the horses. When they saw it they were glad, and their hearts took
LINE 123: comfort within them, whereon Pisistratus said, "Tell me, Menelaus, has
LINE 124: heaven sent this omen for us or for you?"
LINE 125: Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to
LINE 126: make, but Helen was to'quick for him and said, "I will read this
LINE 127: matter as heaven has put it in my heart, and as I doubt not that it
LINE 128: will come t'pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred
LINE 129: and has its nest, and in like manner Ulysses, after having travelled
LINE 130: far and suffered much, will return t'take his revenge—if indeed he is
LINE 131: not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors."
LINE 132: "May Jove s'grant it," replied Telemachus, "if it should prove t'be
LINE 133: so, I will make vows t'you as though you were a god, even when I am at
LINE 134: home."
LINE 135: As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed
LINE 136: through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon
LINE 137: their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and
LINE 138: darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae, where Diocles
LINE 139: lived wh'was son of Ortilochus, the son of Alpheus. There they passed
LINE 140: the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,
LINE 141: rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and their
LINE 142: places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and
LINE 143: under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed
LINE 144: his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came
LINE 145: t'Pylos, and then Telemachus said:
LINE 146: "Pisistratus, I hope you will promise t'd'what I am going t'ask you.
LINE 147: You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover, we are both
LINE 148: of an age, and this journey has brought us together still more closely;
LINE 149: d'not, therefore, take me past my ship, but leave me there, for if I
LINE 150: g't'your father's house he will try t'keep me in the warmth of his
LINE 151: good will towards me, and I must g'home at once."
LINE 152: Pisistratus thought how he should d'as he was asked, and in the end he
LINE 153: deemed it best t'turn his horses towards the ship, and put Menelaus's
LINE 154: beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then
LINE 155: he said, "G'on board at once and tell your men t'd's'als'before I
LINE 156: can reach home t'tell my father. I know how obstinate he is, and am
LINE 157: sure he will not let you go; he will come down here t'fetch you, and
LINE 158: he will not g'back without you. But he will be very angry."
LINE 159: With this he drove his goodly steeds back t'the city of the Pylians
LINE 160: and soon reached his home, but Telemachus called the men together and
LINE 161: gave his orders. "Now, my men," said he, "get everything in order on
LINE 162: board the ship, and let us set out home."
LINE 163: Thus did he speak, and they went on board even as he had said. But as
LINE 164: Telemachus was thus busied, praying als'and sacrificing t'Minerva in
LINE 165: the ship's stern, there came t'him a man from a distant country, a
LINE 166: seer, wh'was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was
LINE 167: descended from Melampus, wh'used t'live in Pylos, the land of sheep;
LINE 168: he was rich and owned a great house, but he was driven int'exile by
LINE 169: the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held
LINE 170: them for a whole year, during which he was a close prisoner in the
LINE 171: house of king Phylacus, and in much distress of mind both on account of
LINE 172: the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow
LINE 173: that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end, however, he escaped
LINE 174: with his life, drove the cattle from Phylace t'Pylos, avenged the
LINE 175: wrong that had been done him, and gave the daughter of Neleus t'his
LINE 176: brother. Then he left the country and went t'Argos, where it was
LINE 177: ordained that he should reign over much people. There he married,
LINE 178: established himself, and had tw'famous sons Antiphates and Mantius.
LINE 179: Antiphates became father of Oicleus, and Oicleus of Amphiaraus, wh'was
LINE 180: dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo, but he did not live t'old
LINE 181: age, for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman's gifts. His sons
LINE 182: were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius, the other son of Melampus, was
LINE 183: father t'Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora, throned in gold, carried off
LINE 184: Cleitus for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the immortals,
LINE 185: but Apoll'made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now
LINE 186: that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to
LINE 187: live in Hyperesia, where he remained and prophesied for all men.
LINE 188: His son, Theoclymenus, it was wh'now came up t'Telemachus as he was
LINE 189: making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. "Friend," said he, "now
LINE 190: that I find you sacrificing in this place, I beseech you by your
LINE 191: sacrifices themselves, and by the god t'whom you make them, I pray you
LINE 192: als'by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth
LINE 193: and nothing but the truth. Wh'and whence are you? Tell me als'of your
LINE 194: town and parents."
LINE 195: Telemachus said, "I will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca, and
LINE 196: my father is Ulysses, as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come
LINE 197: t'some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew
LINE 198: together t'see if I can hear any news of him, for he has been away a
LINE 199: long time."
LINE 200: "I too," answered Theoclymenus, "am an exile, for I have killed a man
LINE 201: of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos, and they
LINE 202: have great power among the Argives. I am flying t'escape death at
LINE 203: their hands, and am thus doomed t'be a wanderer on the face of the
LINE 204: earth. I am your suppliant; take me, therefore, on board your ship that
LINE 205: they may not kill me, for I know they are in pursuit."
LINE 206: "I will not refuse you," replied Telemachus, "if you wish t'join us.
LINE 207: Come, therefore, and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according
LINE 208: t'what we have."
LINE 209: On this he received Theoclymenus' spear and laid it down on the deck of
LINE 210: the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern, bidding Theoclymenus
LINE 211: sit beside him; then the men let g'the hawsers. Telemachus told them
LINE 212: t'catch hold of the ropes, and they made all haste t'd'so. They set
LINE 213: the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it and made it fast
LINE 214: with the forestays, and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of
LINE 215: twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and
LINE 216: strong t'take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then
LINE 217: they passed by Crouni and Chalcis.
LINE 218: Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel
LINE 219: made a quick passage t'Pheae and thence on t'Elis, where the Epeans
LINE 220: rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,132 wondering
LINE 221: within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken
LINE 222: prisoner.
LINE 223: Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the
LINE 224: hut, and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had t'eat and
LINE 225: drink, Ulysses began trying t'prove the swineherd and see whether he
LINE 226: would continue t'treat him kindly, and ask him t'stay on at the
LINE 227: station or pack him off t'the city; s'he said:
LINE 228: "Eumaeus, and all of you, to-morrow I want t'g'away and begin begging
LINE 229: about the town, s'as t'be n'more trouble t'you or t'your men. Give
LINE 230: me your advice therefore, and let me have a good guide t'g'with me
LINE 231: and show me the way. I will g'the round of the city begging as I needs
LINE 232: must, t'see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I
LINE 233: should like als't'g't'the house of Ulysses and bring news of her
LINE 234: husband t'Queen Penelope. I could then g'about among the suitors and
LINE 235: see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should
LINE 236: soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and
LINE 237: believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury wh'gives grace
LINE 238: and good name t'the works of all men, there is n'one living wh'would
LINE 239: make a more handy servant than I should—t'put fresh wood on the fire,
LINE 240: chop fuel, carve, cook, pour out wine, and d'all those services that
LINE 241: poor men have t'd'for their betters."
LINE 242: The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. "Heaven help
LINE 243: me," he exclaimed, "what ever can have put such a notion as that into
LINE 244: your head? If you g'near the suitors you will be undone t'a
LINE 245: certainty, for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They
LINE 246: would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their
LINE 247: servants are all young men, well dressed, wearing good cloaks and
LINE 248: shirts, with well looking faces and their hair always tidy, the tables
LINE 249: are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread, meat, and wine. Stay
LINE 250: where you are, then; you are not in anybody's way; I d'not mind your
LINE 251: being here, n'more d'any of the others, and when Telemachus comes
LINE 252: home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you
LINE 253: want t'go."
LINE 254: Ulysses answered, "I hope you may be as dear t'the gods as you are to
LINE 255: me, for having saved me from going about and getting int'trouble;
LINE 256: there is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still, when men
LINE 257: have once got low down in the world they will g'through a great deal
LINE 258: on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since, however, you press me to
LINE 259: stay here and await the return of Telemachus, tell me about Ulysses'
LINE 260: mother, and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he
LINE 261: set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in
LINE 262: the house of Hades?"
LINE 263: "I will tell you all about them," replied Eumaeus, "Laertes is still
LINE 264: living and prays heaven t'let him depart peacefully in his own house,
LINE 265: for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son, and also
LINE 266: about the death of his wife, which grieved him greatly and aged him
LINE 267: more than anything else did. She came t'an unhappy end133 through
LINE 268: sorrow for her son: may n'friend or neighbour wh'has dealt kindly by
LINE 269: me come t'such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,
LINE 270: though she was always grieving, I used t'like seeing her and asking
LINE 271: her how she did, for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,
LINE 272: the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together, and she
LINE 273: made little difference between us. When, however, we both grew up, they
LINE 274: sent Ctimene t'Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me,
LINE 275: my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for
LINE 276: my feet, and sent me off int'the country, but she was just as fond of
LINE 277: me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to
LINE 278: prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough t'eat
LINE 279: and drink, and can find something for any respectable stranger who
LINE 280: comes here; but there is n'getting a kind word or deed out of my
LINE 281: mistress, for the house has fallen int'the hands of wicked people.
LINE 282: Servants want sometimes t'see their mistress and have a talk with her;
LINE 283: they like t'have something t'eat and drink at the house, and
LINE 284: something to't'take back with them int'the country. This is what
LINE 285: will keep servants in a good humour."
LINE 286: Ulysses answered, "Then you must have been a very little fellow,
LINE 287: Eumaeus, when you were taken s'far away from your home and parents.
LINE 288: Tell me, and tell me true, was the city in which your father and mother
LINE 289: lived sacked and pillaged, or did some enemies carry you off when you
LINE 290: were alone tending sheep or cattle, ship you off here, and sell you for
LINE 291: whatever your master gave them?"
LINE 292: "Stranger," replied Eumaeus, "as regards your question: sit still, make
LINE 293: yourself comfortable, drink your wine, and listen t'me. The nights are
LINE 294: now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and
LINE 295: sitting up talking together; you ought not t'g't'bed till bed time,
LINE 296: to'much sleep is as bad as to'little; if any one of the others wishes
LINE 297: t'g't'bed let him leave us and d'so; he can then take my master's
LINE 298: pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We to'will sit
LINE 299: here eating and drinking in the hut, and telling one another stories
LINE 300: about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much, and been
LINE 301: buffeted about in the world, he takes pleasure in recalling the memory
LINE 302: of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question, then, my
LINE 303: tale is as follows:
LINE 304: "You may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above
LINE 305: Ortygia,134 where the land begins t'turn round and look in another
LINE 306: direction.135 It is not very thickly peopled, but the soil is good,
LINE 307: with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep, and it abounds with wine
LINE 308: and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor are the people plagued by any
LINE 309: sickness, but when they grow old Apoll'comes with Diana and kills them
LINE 310: with his painless shafts. It contains tw'communities, and the whole
LINE 311: country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus,
LINE 312: a man comparable t'the gods, reigned over both.
LINE 313: "Now t'this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for
LINE 314: the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted
LINE 315: with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened t'be a Phoenician woman in
LINE 316: my father's house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant;
LINE 317: these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near
LINE 318: their ship, seduced her, and cajoled her in ways that n'woman can
LINE 319: resist, n'matter how good she may be by nature. The man wh'had
LINE 320: seduced her asked her wh'she was and where she came from, and on this
LINE 321: she told him her father's name. 'I come from Sidon,' said she, 'and am
LINE 322: daughter t'Arybas, a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming
LINE 323: int'the town from the country, some Taphian pirates seized me and took
LINE 324: me here over the sea, where they sold me t'the man wh'owns this
LINE 325: house, and he gave them their price for me.'
LINE 326: "The man wh'had seduced her then said, 'Would you like t'come along
LINE 327: with us t'see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?
LINE 328: They are both alive and are said t'be well off.'
LINE 329: "'I will d's'gladly,' answered she, 'if you men will first swear me a
LINE 330: solemn oath that you will d'me n'harm by the way.'
LINE 331: "They all swore as she told them, and when they had completed their
LINE 332: oath the woman said, 'Hush; and if any of your men meets me in the
LINE 333: street or at the well, d'not let him speak t'me, for fear some one
LINE 334: should g'and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something.
LINE 335: He would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep
LINE 336: your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,
LINE 337: and send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much gold
LINE 338: as I can lay my hands on, and there is something else als'that I can
LINE 339: d'towards paying my fare. I am nurse t'the son of the good man of the
LINE 340: house, a funny little fellow just able t'run about. I will carry him
LINE 341: off in your ship, and you will get a great deal of money for him if you
LINE 342: take him and sell him in foreign parts.'
LINE 343: "On this she went back t'the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole
LINE 344: year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,
LINE 345: and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent t'tell the
LINE 346: woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came t'my father's
LINE 347: house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and
LINE 348: while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and
LINE 349: bargaining about it, he made a sign quietly t'the woman and then went
LINE 350: back t'the ship, whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the
LINE 351: house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the
LINE 352: cups of guests wh'had been feasting with my father, as being in
LINE 353: attendance on him; these were now all gone t'a meeting of the public
LINE 354: assembly, s'she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the
LINE 355: bosom of her dress, while I followed her, for I knew n'better. The sun
LINE 356: was now set, and darkness was over all the land, s'we hurried on as
LINE 357: fast as we could till we reached the harbour, where the Phoenician ship
LINE 358: was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the
LINE 359: sea, taking us with them, and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did
LINE 360: we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Diana struck the
LINE 361: woman and she fell heavily down int'the ship's hold as though she were
LINE 362: a sea gull alighting on the water; s'they threw her overboard t'the
LINE 363: seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the
LINE 364: winds and waves took the ship t'Ithaca, where Laertes gave sundry of
LINE 365: his chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came t'set eyes upon
LINE 366: this country."
LINE 367: Ulysses answered, "Eumaeus, I have heard the story of your misfortunes
LINE 368: with the most lively interest and pity, but Jove has given you good as
LINE 369: well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good master, who
LINE 370: sees that you always have enough t'eat and drink; and you lead a good
LINE 371: life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city t'city."
LINE 372: Thus did they converse, and they had only a very little time left for
LINE 373: sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his
LINE 374: crew were nearing land, s'they loosed the sails, took down the mast,
LINE 375: and rowed the ship int'the harbour.136 They cast out their mooring
LINE 376: stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,
LINE 377: mixed their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough
LINE 378: t'eat and drink Telemachus said, "Take the ship on t'the town, but
LINE 379: leave me here, for I want t'look after the herdsmen on one of my
LINE 380: farms. In the evening, when I have seen all I want, I will come down to
LINE 381: the city, and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give
LINE 382: you all a good dinner with meat and wine." 137
LINE 383: Then Theoclymenus said, "And what, my dear young friend, is t'become
LINE 384: of me? T'whose house, among all your chief men, am I t'repair? or
LINE 385: shall I g'straight t'your own house and t'your mother?"
LINE 386: "At any other time," replied Telemachus, "I should have bidden you go
LINE 387: t'my own house, for you would find n'want of hospitality; at the
LINE 388: present moment, however, you would not be comfortable there, for I
LINE 389: shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often show
LINE 390: herself even t'the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper
LINE 391: chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can
LINE 392: g'to—I mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus, wh'is held in the highest
LINE 393: estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most
LINE 394: persistent wooer, of all those wh'are paying court t'my mother and
LINE 395: trying t'take Ulysses' place. Jove, however, in heaven alone knows
LINE 396: whether or n'they will come t'a bad end before the marriage takes
LINE 397: place."
LINE 398: As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand—a hawk, Apollo's
LINE 399: messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the feathers, as it tore
LINE 400: them off,138 fell t'the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.
LINE 401: On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.
LINE 402: "Telemachus," said he, "that bird did not fly on your right hand
LINE 403: without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew
LINE 404: it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there
LINE 405: will be n'house in Ithaca more royal than your own."
LINE 406: "I wish it may prove so," answered Telemachus. "If it does, I will show
LINE 407: you s'much good will and give you s'many presents that all wh'meet
LINE 408: you will congratulate you."
LINE 409: Then he said t'his friend Piraeus, "Piraeus, son of Clytius, you have
LINE 410: throughout shown yourself the most willing t'serve me of all those who
LINE 411: have accompanied me t'Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to
LINE 412: your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him."
LINE 413: And Piraeus answered, "Telemachus, you may stay away as long as you
LINE 414: please, but I will look after him for you, and he shall find n'lack of
LINE 415: hospitality."
LINE 416: As he spoke he went on board, and bade the others d's'als'and loose
LINE 417: the hawsers, s'they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus
LINE 418: bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a head of
LINE 419: sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the
LINE 420: hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as
LINE 421: they had been told t'do, while Telemachus strode on as fast as he
LINE 422: could, till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine
LINE 423: were feeding, and where dwelt the excellent swineherd, wh'was so
LINE 424: devoted a servant t'his master.
