LINE 1: THE FIGHT WITH IRUS—ULYSSES WARNS AMPHINOMUS—PENELOPE GETS PRESENTS
LINE 2: FROM THE SUITORS—THE BRAZIERS—ULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.
LINE 3: Now there came a certain common tramp wh'used t'g'begging all over
LINE 4: the city of Ithaca, and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and
LINE 5: drunkard. This man had n'strength nor stay in him, but he was a great
LINE 6: hulking fellow t'look at; his real name, the one his mother gave him,
LINE 7: was Arnaeus, but the young men of the place called him Irus,148 because
LINE 8: he used t'run errands for any one wh'would send him. As soon as he
LINE 9: came he began t'insult Ulysses, and t'try and drive him out of his
LINE 10: own house.
LINE 11: "Be off, old man," he cried, "from the doorway, or you shall be dragged
LINE 12: out neck and heels. D'you not see that they are all giving me the
LINE 13: wink, and wanting me t'turn you out by force, only I d'not like t'do
LINE 14: so? Get up then, and g'of yourself, or we shall come t'blows."
LINE 15: Ulysses frowned on him and said, "My friend, I d'you n'manner of
LINE 16: harm; people give you a great deal, but I am not jealous. There is room
LINE 17: enough in this doorway for the pair of us, and you need not grudge me
LINE 18: things that are not yours t'give. You seem t'be just such another
LINE 19: tramp as myself, but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and
LINE 20: by. D'not, however, talk to'much about fighting or you will incense
LINE 21: me, and old though I am, I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood.
LINE 22: I shall have more peace tomorrow if I do, for you will not come t'the
LINE 23: house of Ulysses any more."
LINE 24: Irus was very angry and answered, "You filthy glutton, you run on
LINE 25: trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind t'lay both hands
LINE 26: about you, and knock your teeth out of your head like s'many boar's
LINE 27: tusks. Get ready, therefore, and let these people here stand by and
LINE 28: look on. You will never be able t'fight one wh'is s'much younger
LINE 29: than yourself."
LINE 30: Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front
LINE 31: of the doorway,149 and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed
LINE 32: heartily and said t'the others, "This is the finest sport that you
LINE 33: ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it int'this house. The
LINE 34: stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going t'fight, let us set
LINE 35: them on t'd's'at once."
LINE 36: The suitors all came up laughing, and gathered round the tw'ragged
LINE 37: tramps. "Listen t'me," said Antinous, "there are some goats' paunches
LINE 38: down at the fire, which we have filled with blood and fat, and set
LINE 39: aside for supper; he wh'is victorious and proves himself t'be the
LINE 40: better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our
LINE 41: table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all."
LINE 42: The others all agreed, but Ulysses, t'throw them off the scent, said,
LINE 43: "Sirs, an old man like myself, worn out with suffering, cannot hold his
LINE 44: own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on, though
LINE 45: I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,
LINE 46: however that none of you will give me a foul blow t'favour Irus and
LINE 47: secure him the victory."
LINE 48: They swore as he told them, and when they had completed their oath
LINE 49: Telemachus put in a word and said, "Stranger, if you have a mind to
LINE 50: settle with this fellow, you need not be afraid of any one here.
LINE 51: Whoever strikes you will have t'fight more than one. I am host, and
LINE 52: the other chiefs, Antinous and Eurymachus, both of them men of
LINE 53: understanding, are of the same mind as I am."
LINE 54: Every one assented, and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,
LINE 55: thus baring his stalwart thighs, his broad chest and shoulders, and his
LINE 56: mighty arms; but Minerva came up t'him and made his limbs even
LINE 57: stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished, and one
LINE 58: would turn towards his neighbour saying, "The stranger has brought such
LINE 59: a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of
LINE 60: Irus."
LINE 61: Irus began t'be very uneasy as he heard them, but the servants girded
LINE 62: him by force, and brought him [int'the open part of the court] in such
LINE 63: a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and
LINE 64: said, "You swaggering bully, you ought never t'have been born at all
LINE 65: if you are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.
LINE 66: I say, therefore—and it shall surely be—if he beats you and proves
LINE 67: himself the better man, I shall pack you off on board ship t'the
LINE 68: mainland and send you t'king Echetus, wh'kills every one that comes
LINE 69: near him. He will cut off your nose and ears, and draw out your
LINE 70: entrails for the dogs t'eat."
LINE 71: This frightened Irus still more, but they brought him int'the middle
LINE 72: of the court, and the tw'men raised their hands t'fight. Then Ulysses
LINE 73: considered whether he should let drive s'hard at him as t'make an end
LINE 74: of him then and there, or whether he should give him a lighter blow
LINE 75: that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best t'give
LINE 76: the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin t'suspect wh'he
LINE 77: was. Then they began t'fight, and Irus hit Ulysses on the right
LINE 78: shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that
LINE 79: broke in the bones of his skull, and the blood came gushing out of his
LINE 80: mouth; he fell groaning in the dust, gnashing his teeth and kicking on
LINE 81: the ground, but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of
LINE 82: laughter, as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him
LINE 83: int'the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up
LINE 84: against the wall and put his staff in his hands. "Sit here," said he,
LINE 85: "and keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature, and if you
LINE 86: try t'make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still
LINE 87: worse."
LINE 88: Then he threw his dirty old wallet, all tattered and torn over his
LINE 89: shoulder with the cord by which it hung, and went back t'sit down upon
LINE 90: the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters, laughing and
LINE 91: saluting him, "May Jove, and all the other gods," said they, "grant you
LINE 92: whatever you want for having put an end t'the importunity of this
LINE 93: insatiable tramp. We will take him over t'the mainland presently, to
LINE 94: king Echetus, wh'kills every one that comes near him."
LINE 95: Ulysses hailed this as of good omen, and Antinous set a great goat's
LINE 96: paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took tw'loaves
LINE 97: out of the bread-basket and brought them t'him, pledging him as he did
LINE 98: s'in a golden goblet of wine. "Good luck t'you," he said, "father
LINE 99: stranger, you are very badly off at present, but I hope you will have
LINE 100: better times by and by."
LINE 101: T'this Ulysses answered, "Amphinomus, you seem t'be a man of good
LINE 102: understanding, as indeed you may well be, seeing whose son you are. I
LINE 103: have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium, a man
LINE 104: both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son, and you appear to
LINE 105: be a considerable person; listen, therefore, and take heed t'what I am
LINE 106: saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon
LINE 107: earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength, he thinks
LINE 108: that he shall come t'n'harm hereafter, and even when the blessed gods
LINE 109: bring sorrow upon him, he bears it as he needs must, and makes the best
LINE 110: of it; for God almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know
LINE 111: all about it, for I was a rich man once, and did much wrong in the
LINE 112: stubbornness of my pride, and in the confidence that my father and my
LINE 113: brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things
LINE 114: always, and take the good that heaven may see fit t'send him without
LINE 115: vain glory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see
LINE 116: how they are wasting the estate, and doing dishonour t'the wife, of
LINE 117: one wh'is certain t'return some day, and that, too, not long hence.
LINE 118: Nay, he will be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that
LINE 119: you may not meet with him in the day of his coming, for once he is here
LINE 120: the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly."
LINE 121: With these words he made a drink-offering, and when he had drunk he put
LINE 122: the gold cup again int'the hands of Amphinomus, wh'walked away
LINE 123: serious and bowing his head, for he foreboded evil. But even s'he did
LINE 124: not escape destruction, for Minerva had doomed him t'fall by the hand
LINE 125: of Telemachus. S'he took his seat again at the place from which he had
LINE 126: come.
LINE 127: Then Minerva put it int'the mind of Penelope t'show herself t'the
LINE 128: suitors, that she might make them still more enamoured of her, and win
LINE 129: still further honour from her son and husband. S'she feigned a mocking
LINE 130: laugh and said, "Eurynome, I have changed my mind, and have a fancy to
LINE 131: show myself t'the suitors although I detest them. I should like also
LINE 132: t'give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more t'do
LINE 133: with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief."
LINE 134: "My dear child," answered Eurynome, "all that you have said is true, go
LINE 135: and tell your son about it, but first wash yourself and anoint your
LINE 136: face. D'not g'about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is
LINE 137: not right that you should grieve s'incessantly; for Telemachus, whom
LINE 138: you always prayed that you might live t'see with a beard, is already
LINE 139: grown up."
LINE 140: "I know, Eurynome," replied Penelope, "that you mean well, but d'not
LINE 141: try and persuade me t'wash and t'anoint myself, for heaven robbed me
LINE 142: of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless, tell
LINE 143: Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I am
LINE 144: in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be
LINE 145: proper for me t'd'so."
LINE 146: On this the old woman150 went out of the room t'bid the maids g'to
LINE 147: their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another
LINE 148: matter, and sent Penelope off int'a sweet slumber; s'she lay down on
LINE 149: her couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed
LINE 150: grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She
LINE 151: washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she
LINE 152: goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more
LINE 153: commanding figure, while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn
LINE 154: ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away, whereon the maids
LINE 155: came in from the women's room and woke Penelope with the sound of their
LINE 156: talking.
LINE 157: "What an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having," said she, as
LINE 158: she passed her hands over her face, "in spite of all my misery. I wish
LINE 159: Diana would let me die s'sweetly now at this very moment, that I might
LINE 160: n'longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband, who
LINE 161: possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man
LINE 162: among the Achaeans."
LINE 163: With these words she came down from her upper room, not alone but
LINE 164: attended by tw'of her maidens, and when she reached the suitors she
LINE 165: stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,
LINE 166: holding a veil before her face, and with a staid maid servant on either
LINE 167: side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were s'overpowered and
LINE 168: became s'desperately enamoured of her, that each one prayed he might
LINE 169: win her for his own bed fellow.
LINE 170: "Telemachus," said she, addressing her son, "I fear you are n'longer
LINE 171: s'discreet and well conducted as you used t'be. When you were younger
LINE 172: you had a greater sense of propriety; now, however, that you are grown
LINE 173: up, though a stranger t'look at you would take you for the son of a
LINE 174: well t'd'father as far as size and good looks go, your conduct is by
LINE 175: n'means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been
LINE 176: going on, and how came you t'allow a stranger t'be s'disgracefully
LINE 177: ill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury
LINE 178: while a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very
LINE 179: discreditable t'you."
LINE 180: "I am not surprised, my dear mother, at your displeasure," replied
LINE 181: Telemachus, "I understand all about it and know when things are not as
LINE 182: they should be, which I could not d'when I was younger; I cannot,
LINE 183: however, behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then
LINE 184: another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,
LINE 185: and I have n'one t'stand by me. After all, however, this fight
LINE 186: between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it
LINE 187: t'do, for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,
LINE 188: Minerva, and Apoll'would break the neck of every one of these wooers
LINE 189: of yours, some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all
LINE 190: be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See
LINE 191: how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing
LINE 192: that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back t'his home, wherever
LINE 193: that may be, for he has n'strength left in him."
LINE 194: Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said, "Queen
LINE 195: Penelope, daughter of Icarius, if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos
LINE 196: could see you at this moment, you would have still more suitors in your
LINE 197: house by tomorrow morning, for you are the most admirable woman in the
LINE 198: whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of
LINE 199: understanding."
LINE 200: T'this Penelope replied, "Eurymachus, heaven robbed me of all my
LINE 201: beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and
LINE 202: my dear husband with them. If he were t'return and look after my
LINE 203: affairs, I should both be more respected and show a better presence to
LINE 204: the world. As it is, I am oppressed with care, and with the afflictions
LINE 205: which heaven has seen fit t'heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,
LINE 206: and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand—'Wife,'
LINE 207: he said, 'we shall not all of us come safe home from Troy, for the
LINE 208: Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent als'at
LINE 209: fighting from chariots, and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner
LINE 210: than this. I know not, therefore, whether heaven will send me back to
LINE 211: you, or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do
LINE 212: you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at
LINE 213: present, and even more s'during my absence, but when you see our son
LINE 214: growing a beard, then marry whom you will, and leave this your present
LINE 215: home.' This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will
LINE 216: come when I shall have t'yield myself t'a marriage which I detest,
LINE 217: for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief,
LINE 218: moreover, cuts me t'the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me
LINE 219: after the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman wh'they
LINE 220: think will be a good wife t'them and wh'is of noble birth, and when
LINE 221: they are each trying t'win her for himself, they usually bring oxen
LINE 222: and sheep t'feast the friends of the lady, and they make her
LINE 223: magnificent presents, instead of eating up other people's property
LINE 224: without paying for it."
LINE 225: This was what she said, and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying
LINE 226: t'get presents out of the suitors, and flattering them with fair words
LINE 227: which he knew she did not mean.
LINE 228: Then Antinous said, "Queen Penelope, daughter of Icarius, take as many
LINE 229: presents as you please from any one wh'will give them t'you; it is
LINE 230: not well t'refuse a present; but we will not g'about our business nor
LINE 231: stir from where we are, till you have married the best man among us
LINE 232: whoever he may be."
LINE 233: The others applauded what Antinous had said, and each one sent his
LINE 234: servant t'bring his present. Antinous's man returned with a large and
LINE 235: lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully
LINE 236: made brooch pins of pure gold with which t'fasten it. Eurymachus
LINE 237: immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads
LINE 238: that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas's tw'men returned with some
LINE 239: earrings fashioned int'three brilliant pendants which glistened most
LINE 240: beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of
LINE 241: the rarest workmanship, and every one else brought her a beautiful
LINE 242: present of some kind.
LINE 243: Then the queen went back t'her room upstairs, and her maids brought
LINE 244: the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took t'singing and
LINE 245: dancing, and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it
LINE 246: grew dark; they then brought in three braziers151 t'give light, and
LINE 247: piled them up with chopped firewood very old and dry, and they lit
LINE 248: torches from them, which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then
LINE 249: Ulysses said:
LINE 250: "Maids, servants of Ulysses wh'has s'long been absent, g't'the
LINE 251: queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her, or spin, and pick
LINE 252: wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till
LINE 253: morning, but shall not beat me, for I can stand a great deal."
LINE 254: The maids looked at one another and laughed, while pretty Melantho
LINE 255: began t'gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter t'Dolius, but
LINE 256: had been brought up by Penelope, wh'used t'give her toys t'play
LINE 257: with, and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all
LINE 258: this she showed n'consideration for the sorrows of her mistress, and
LINE 259: used t'misconduct herself with Eurymachus, with whom she was in love.
LINE 260: "Poor wretch," said she, "are you gone clean out of your mind? G'and
LINE 261: sleep in some smithy, or place of public gossips, instead of chattering
LINE 262: here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters—so
LINE 263: many of them too? Has the wine been getting int'your head, or d'you
LINE 264: always babble in this way? You seem t'have lost your wits because you
LINE 265: beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come
LINE 266: and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the
LINE 267: house."
LINE 268: "Vixen," replied Ulysses, scowling at her, "I will g'and tell
LINE 269: Telemachus what you have been saying, and he will have you torn limb
LINE 270: from limb."
LINE 271: With these words he scared the women, and they went off int'the body
LINE 272: of the house. They trembled all over, for they thought he would d'as
LINE 273: he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers, holding
LINE 274: up torches and looking at the people—brooding the while on things that
LINE 275: should surely come t'pass.
LINE 276: But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their
LINE 277: insolence, for she wanted Ulysses t'become even more bitter against
LINE 278: them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on t'gibe at him,
LINE 279: which made the others laugh. "Listen t'me," said he, "you suitors of
LINE 280: Queen Penelope, that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for
LINE 281: nothing that this man has come t'the house of Ulysses; I believe the
LINE 282: light has not been coming from the torches, but from his own head—for
LINE 283: his hair is all gone, every bit of it."
LINE 284: Then turning t'Ulysses he said, "Stranger, will you work as a servant,
LINE 285: if I send you t'the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you
LINE 286: build a stone fence, or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year
LINE 287: round, and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go, then? Not
LINE 288: you; for you have got int'bad ways, and d'not want t'work; you had
LINE 289: rather fill your belly by going round the country begging."
LINE 290: "Eurymachus," answered Ulysses, "if you and I were t'work one against
LINE 291: the other in early summer when the days are at their longest—give me a
LINE 292: good scythe, and take another yourself, and let us see which will last
LINE 293: the longer or mow the stronger, from dawn till dark when the mowing
LINE 294: grass is about. Or if you will plough against me, let us each take a
LINE 295: yoke of tawny oxen, well-mated and of great strength and endurance:
LINE 296: turn me int'a four acre field, and see whether you or I can drive the
LINE 297: straighter furrow. If, again, war were t'break out this day, give me a
LINE 298: shield, a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my
LINE 299: temples—you would find me foremost in the fray, and would cease your
LINE 300: gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel, and think yourself a
LINE 301: great man because you live in a little world, and that a bad one. If
LINE 302: Ulysses comes t'his own again, the doors of his house are wide, but
LINE 303: you will find them narrow when you try t'fly through them."
LINE 304: Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried, "You
LINE 305: wretch, I will soon pay you out for daring t'say such things t'me,
LINE 306: and in public too. Has the wine been getting int'your head or d'you
LINE 307: always babble in this way? You seem t'have lost your wits because you
LINE 308: beat the tramp Irus." With this he caught hold of a footstool, but
LINE 309: Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium, for
LINE 310: he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and
LINE 311: knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back, and his
LINE 312: wine-jug fell ringing t'the ground. The suitors in the covered
LINE 313: cloister were now in an uproar, and one would turn towards his
LINE 314: neighbour, saying, "I wish the stranger had gone somewhere else, bad
LINE 315: luck t'him, for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such
LINE 316: disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are t'prevail we
LINE 317: shall have n'more pleasure at our banquet."
LINE 318: On this Telemachus came forward and said, "Sirs, are you mad? Can you
LINE 319: not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has
LINE 320: possessed you. I d'not wish t'drive any of you away, but you have had
LINE 321: your suppers, and the sooner you all g'home t'bed the better."
LINE 322: The suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;
LINE 323: but Amphinomus the son of Nisus, wh'was son t'Aretias, said, "D'not
LINE 324: let us take offence; it is reasonable, s'let us make n'answer.
LINE 325: Neither let us d'violence t'the stranger nor t'any of Ulysses'
LINE 326: servants. Let the cupbearer g'round with the drink-offerings, that we
LINE 327: may make them and g'home t'our rest. As for the stranger, let us
LINE 328: leave Telemachus t'deal with him, for it is t'his house that he has
LINE 329: come."
LINE 330: Thus did he speak, and his saying pleased them well, s'Mulius of
LINE 331: Dulichium, servant t'Amphinomus, mixed them a bowl of wine and water
LINE 332: and handed it round t'each of them man by man, whereon they made their
LINE 333: drink-offerings t'the blessed gods: Then, when they had made their
LINE 334: drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded, they took
LINE 335: their several ways each of them t'his own abode.
