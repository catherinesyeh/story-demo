LINE 1: THE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES—ULYSSES AND HIS MEN G'T'THE HOUSE
LINE 2: OF LAERTES—THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT T'ATTACK ULYSSES, BUT MINERVA
LINE 3: CONCLUDES A PEACE.
LINE 4: Then Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors, and in his
LINE 5: hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men's eyes in
LINE 6: sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts
LINE 7: and led them, while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As
LINE 8: bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave, when one of them
LINE 9: has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang, even s'did the
LINE 10: ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down
LINE 11: int'the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of
LINE 12: Oceanus and the rock Leucas, they came t'the gates of the sun and the
LINE 13: land of dreams, whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell
LINE 14: the souls and shadows of them that can labour n'more.
LINE 15: Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus, with those of
LINE 16: Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax, wh'was the finest and handsomest man
LINE 17: of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.
LINE 18: They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus, and the ghost of
LINE 19: Agamemnon joined them, sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also
LINE 20: the ghosts of those wh'had perished with him in the house of
LINE 21: Aegisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.
LINE 22: "Son of Atreus," it said, "we used t'say that Jove had loved you
LINE 23: better from first t'last than any other hero, for you were captain
LINE 24: over many and brave men, when we were all fighting together before
LINE 25: Troy; yet the hand of death, which n'mortal can escape, was laid upon
LINE 26: you all to'early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day
LINE 27: of your renown, for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your
LINE 28: ashes, and your son would have been heir t'your good name, whereas it
LINE 29: has now been your lot t'come t'a most miserable end."
LINE 30: "Happy son of Peleus," answered the ghost of Agamemnon, "for having
LINE 31: died at Troy far from Argos, while the bravest of the Trojans and the
LINE 32: Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the
LINE 33: whirling clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless now of your
LINE 34: chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day, nor should we ever
LINE 35: have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane t'stay us. Then, when
LINE 36: we had borne you t'the ships out of the fray, we laid you on your bed
LINE 37: and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The
LINE 38: Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,
LINE 39: when she heard, came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea, and
LINE 40: the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters s'that the
LINE 41: Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken t'their
LINE 42: ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked
LINE 43: them saying, 'Hold, Argives, fly not sons of the Achaeans, this is his
LINE 44: mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs t'view the body of
LINE 45: her son.'
LINE 46: "Thus he spoke, and the Achaeans feared n'more. The daughters of the
LINE 47: old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly, and clothed you in
LINE 48: immortal raiment. The nine muses als'came and lifted up their sweet
LINE 49: voices in lament—calling and answering one another; there was not an
LINE 50: Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights
LINE 51: seven and ten we mourned you, mortals and immortals, but on the
LINE 52: eighteenth day we gave you t'the flames, and many a fat sheep with
LINE 53: many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in
LINE 54: raiment of the gods, with rich resins and with honey, while heroes,
LINE 55: horse and foot, clashed their armour round the pile as you were
LINE 56: burning, with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of
LINE 57: heaven had done their work, we gathered your white bones at daybreak
LINE 58: and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a
LINE 59: golden vase t'hold them—gift of Bacchus, and work of Vulcan himself;
LINE 60: in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus wh'had
LINE 61: gone before you, and separate we enclosed als'those of Antilochus, who
LINE 62: had been closer t'you than any other of your comrades now that
LINE 63: Patroclus was n'more.
LINE 64: "Over these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb, on a point
LINE 65: jutting out over the open Hellespont, that it might be seen from far
LINE 66: out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born
LINE 67: hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods, and offered them to
LINE 68: be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been
LINE 69: present at the funeral of many a hero, when the young men gird
LINE 70: themselves and make ready t'contend for prizes on the death of some
LINE 71: great chieftain, but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis
LINE 72: offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death
LINE 73: your fame, Achilles, has not been lost, and your name lives evermore
LINE 74: among all mankind. But as for me, what solace had I when the days of my
LINE 75: fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return, by the
LINE 76: hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife."
LINE 77: Thus did they converse, and presently Mercury came up t'them with the
LINE 78: ghosts of the suitors wh'had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of
LINE 79: Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them, and went up to
LINE 80: them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of
LINE 81: Melaneus, wh'lived in Ithaca and had been his host, s'it began to
LINE 82: talk t'him.
LINE 83: "Amphimedon," it said, "what has happened t'all you fine young men—all
LINE 84: of an age too—that you are come down here under the ground? One could
LINE 85: pick n'finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds
LINE 86: and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an
LINE 87: end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or
LINE 88: sheep-stealing, or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?
LINE 89: Answer my question, for I have been your guest. D'you not remember how
LINE 90: I came t'your house with Menelaus, t'persuade Ulysses t'join us with
LINE 91: his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our
LINE 92: voyage, for we had hard work t'persuade Ulysses t'come with us."
LINE 93: And the ghost of Amphimedon answered, "Agamemnon, son of Atreus, king
LINE 94: of men, I remember everything that you have said, and will tell you
LINE 95: fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.
LINE 96: Ulysses had been long gone, and we were courting his wife, wh'did not
LINE 97: say point blank that she would not marry, nor yet bring matters t'an
LINE 98: end, for she meant t'compass our destruction: this, then, was the
LINE 99: trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and
LINE 100: began t'work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweethearts,'
LINE 101: said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still, d'not press me t'marry
LINE 102: again immediately; wait—for I would not have my skill in needlework
LINE 103: perish unrecorded—till I have completed a pall for the her'Laertes,
LINE 104: against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich, and the
LINE 105: women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.' This is
LINE 106: what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon
LINE 107: her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches
LINE 108: again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without
LINE 109: our finding it out, but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth
LINE 110: year, in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished, one
LINE 111: of her maids wh'knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in
LINE 112: the act of undoing her work, s'she had t'finish it whether she would
LINE 113: or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had
LINE 114: it washed,186 its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.
LINE 115: "Then some malicious god conveyed Ulysses t'the upland farm where his
LINE 116: swineherd lives. Thither presently came als'his son, returning from a
LINE 117: voyage t'Pylos, and the tw'came t'the town when they had hatched
LINE 118: their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first, and then after
LINE 119: him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Ulysses, clad in rags and
LINE 120: leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came
LINE 121: s'unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among
LINE 122: us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being
LINE 123: struck and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but
LINE 124: when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him, he and Telemachus
LINE 125: took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors
LINE 126: behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a
LINE 127: quantity of iron t'be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this
LINE 128: was the beginning of our end, for not one of us could string the
LINE 129: bow—nor nearly d'so. When it was about t'reach the hands of Ulysses,
LINE 130: we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him, n'matter
LINE 131: what he might say, but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he
LINE 132: had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow
LINE 133: through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured
LINE 134: his arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed
LINE 135: Antinous, and then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly
LINE 136: darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of
LINE 137: the gods was helping them, for they fell upon us with might and main
LINE 138: throughout the cloisters, and there was a hideous sound of groaning as
LINE 139: our brains were being battered in, and the ground seethed with our
LINE 140: blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and our bodies are
LINE 141: lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses, for our friends at
LINE 142: home d'not yet know what has happened, s'that they cannot lay us out
LINE 143: and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according
LINE 144: t'the offices due t'the departed."
LINE 145: "Happy Ulysses, son of Laertes," replied the ghost of Agamemnon, "you
LINE 146: are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare
LINE 147: excellence of understanding, and s'faithful t'her wedded lord as
LINE 148: Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame, therefore, of her virtue
LINE 149: shall never die, and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be
LINE 150: welcome t'all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far
LINE 151: otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus wh'killed
LINE 152: her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men, for she has
LINE 153: brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones."
LINE 154: Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the
LINE 155: bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the
LINE 156: town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes, which
LINE 157: he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house, with a
LINE 158: lean-t'running all round it, where the slaves wh'worked for him slept
LINE 159: and sat and ate, while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman,
LINE 160: wh'looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there,
LINE 161: he said t'his son and t'the other two:
LINE 162: "G't'the house, and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.
LINE 163: Meanwhile I want t'see whether my father will know me, or fail to
LINE 164: recognise me after s'long an absence."
LINE 165: He then took off his armour and gave it t'Eumaeus and Philoetius, who
LINE 166: went straight on t'the house, while he turned off int'the vineyard to
LINE 167: make trial of his father. As he went down int'the great orchard, he
LINE 168: did not see Dolius, nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen, for
LINE 169: they were all gathering thorns t'make a fence for the vineyard, at the
LINE 170: place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father
LINE 171: alone, hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very
LINE 172: shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide t'save him
LINE 173: from the brambles, and he als'wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat
LINE 174: skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw
LINE 175: him s'worn, s'old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall
LINE 176: pear tree and began t'weep. He doubted whether t'embrace him, kiss
LINE 177: him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should
LINE 178: first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it
LINE 179: best t'be crafty with him, s'in this mind he went up t'his father,
LINE 180: wh'was bending down and digging about a plant.
LINE 181: "I see, sir," said Ulysses, "that you are an excellent gardener—what
LINE 182: pains you take with it, t'be sure. There is not a single plant, not a
LINE 183: fig tree, vine, olive, pear, nor flower bed, but bears the trace of
LINE 184: your attention. I trust, however, that you will not be offended if I
LINE 185: say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are
LINE 186: old, unsavoury, and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle
LINE 187: that your master takes such poor care of you, indeed your face and
LINE 188: figure have nothing of the slave about them, and proclaim you of noble
LINE 189: birth. I should have said that you were one of those wh'should wash
LINE 190: well, eat well, and lie soft at night as old men have a right t'do;
LINE 191: but tell me, and tell me true, whose bondman are you, and in whose
LINE 192: garden are you working? Tell me als'about another matter. Is this
LINE 193: place that I have come t'really Ithaca? I met a man just now wh'said
LINE 194: so, but he was a dull fellow, and had not the patience t'hear my story
LINE 195: out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine, whether he was
LINE 196: still living, or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me
LINE 197: when I tell you that this man came t'my house once when I was in my
LINE 198: own country and never yet did any stranger come t'me whom I liked
LINE 199: better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father
LINE 200: was Laertes, son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably, making him
LINE 201: welcome t'all the abundance of my house, and when he went away I gave
LINE 202: him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold, and
LINE 203: a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve
LINE 204: light cloaks, and as many pieces of tapestry; I als'gave him twelve
LINE 205: cloaks of single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, and an equal
LINE 206: number of shirts. T'all this I added four good looking women skilled
LINE 207: in all useful arts, and I let him take his choice."
LINE 208: His father shed tears and answered, "Sir, you have indeed come t'the
LINE 209: country that you have named, but it is fallen int'the hands of wicked
LINE 210: people. All this wealth of presents has been given t'n'purpose. If
LINE 211: you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca, he would have
LINE 212: entertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply
LINE 213: when you left him—as would have been only right considering what you
LINE 214: had already given him. But tell me, and tell me true, how many years is
LINE 215: it since you entertained this guest—my unhappy son, as ever was? Alas!
LINE 216: He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have
LINE 217: eaten him, or he has fallen a prey t'the birds and wild beasts of some
LINE 218: continent. Neither his mother, nor I his father, wh'were his parents,
LINE 219: could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud, nor could
LINE 220: his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as
LINE 221: was natural upon his death bed, and close his eyes according t'the
LINE 222: offices due t'the departed. But now, tell me truly for I want t'know.
LINE 223: Wh'and whence are you—tell me of your town and parents? Where is the
LINE 224: ship lying that has brought you and your men t'Ithaca? Or were you a
LINE 225: passenger on some other man's ship, and those wh'brought you here have
LINE 226: gone on their way and left you?"
LINE 227: "I will tell you everything," answered Ulysses, "quite truly. I come
LINE 228: from Alybas, where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas, who
LINE 229: is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off
LINE 230: my course as I was leaving Sicania, and I have been carried here
LINE 231: against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder, off the open
LINE 232: country outside the town, and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left
LINE 233: my country. Poor fellow, yet the omens were good for him when he left
LINE 234: me. The birds all flew on our right hands, and both he and I rejoiced
LINE 235: t'see them as we parted, for we had every hope that we should have
LINE 236: another friendly meeting and exchange presents."
LINE 237: A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both
LINE 238: hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey
LINE 239: head, groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,
LINE 240: and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang
LINE 241: towards him, flung his arms about him and kissed him, saying, "I am he,
LINE 242: father, about whom you are asking—I have returned after having been
LINE 243: away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation—we have
LINE 244: n'time t'lose, for I should tell you that I have been killing the
LINE 245: suitors in my house, t'punish them for their insolence and crimes."
LINE 246: "If you really are my son Ulysses," replied Laertes, "and have come
LINE 247: back again, you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as
LINE 248: shall convince me."
LINE 249: "First observe this scar," answered Ulysses, "which I got from a boar's
LINE 250: tusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me
LINE 251: t'Autolycus, my mother's father, t'receive the presents which when he
LINE 252: was over here he had promised t'give me. Furthermore I will point out
LINE 253: t'you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me, and I asked you all
LINE 254: about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,
LINE 255: and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me
LINE 256: thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, and forty fig trees; you also
LINE 257: said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted
LINE 258: between each row, and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of
LINE 259: heaven has been laid heavy upon them."
LINE 260: Laertes' strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which
LINE 261: his son had given him. He threw his arms about him, and Ulysses had to
LINE 262: support him, or he would have gone off int'a swoon; but as soon as he
LINE 263: came to, and was beginning t'recover his senses, he said, "'father
LINE 264: Jove, then you gods are still in Olympus after all, if the suitors have
LINE 265: really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless, I am
LINE 266: much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here
LINE 267: directly, and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the
LINE 268: cities of the Cephallenians."
LINE 269: Ulysses answered, "Take heart and d'not trouble yourself about that,
LINE 270: but let us g'int'the house hard by your garden. I have already told
LINE 271: Telemachus, Philoetius, and Eumaeus t'g'on there and get dinner ready
LINE 272: as soon as possible."
LINE 273: Thus conversing the tw'made their way towards the house. When they got
LINE 274: there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting
LINE 275: up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took
LINE 276: Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on
LINE 277: a good cloak, and Minerva came up t'him and gave him a more imposing
LINE 278: presence, making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back
LINE 279: his son was surprised t'see him looking s'like an immortal, and said
LINE 280: t'him, "My dear father, some one of the gods has been making you much
LINE 281: taller and better-looking."
LINE 282: Laertes answered, "Would, by Father Jove, Minerva, and Apollo, that I
LINE 283: were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians, and took
LINE 284: Nericum, that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I
LINE 285: then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on, I
LINE 286: should have been able t'stand by you and help you against the suitors.
LINE 287: I should have killed a great many of them, and you would have rejoiced
LINE 288: t'see it."
LINE 289: Thus did they converse; but the others, when they had finished their
LINE 290: work and the feast was ready, left off working, and took each his
LINE 291: proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and
LINE 292: by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up, for their
LINE 293: mother, the Sicel woman wh'looked after Laertes now that he was
LINE 294: growing old, had been t'fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were
LINE 295: certain it was he, they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses
LINE 296: scolded them good naturedly and said, "Sit down t'your dinner, old
LINE 297: man, and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting t'begin
LINE 298: for some time and have been waiting for you."
LINE 299: Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up t'Ulysses. "Sir," said
LINE 300: he, seizing his master's hand and kissing it at the wrist, "we have
LINE 301: long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you t'us after
LINE 302: we had given up hoping. All hail, therefore, and may the gods prosper
LINE 303: you.187 But tell me, does Penelope already know of your return, or
LINE 304: shall we send some one t'tell her?"
LINE 305: "Old man," answered Ulysses, "she knows already, s'you need not
LINE 306: trouble about that." On this he took his seat, and the sons of Dolius
LINE 307: gathered round Ulysses t'give him greeting and embrace him one after
LINE 308: the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their
LINE 309: father.
LINE 310: While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready, Rumour went round
LINE 311: the town, and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the
LINE 312: suitors; as soon, therefore, as the people heard of it they gathered
LINE 313: from every quarter, groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.
LINE 314: They took the dead away, buried every man his own, and put the bodies
LINE 315: of those wh'came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels, for the
LINE 316: fishermen t'take each of them t'his own place. They then met angrily
LINE 317: in the place of assembly, and when they were got together Eupeithes
LINE 318: rose t'speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son
LINE 319: Antinous, wh'had been the first man killed by Ulysses, s'he said,
LINE 320: weeping bitterly, "My friends, this man has done the Achaeans great
LINE 321: wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he
LINE 322: has lost both ships and men; now, moreover, on his return he has been
LINE 323: killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and
LINE 324: doing before he can get away t'Pylos or t'Elis where the Epeans rule,
LINE 325: or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an
LINE 326: everlasting disgrace t'us if we d'not avenge the murder of our sons
LINE 327: and brothers. For my own part I should have n'more pleasure in life,
LINE 328: but had rather die at once. Let us be up, then, and after them, before
LINE 329: they can cross over t'the main land."
LINE 330: He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard
LINE 331: Phemius had now woke up, and came t'them from the house of Ulysses.
LINE 332: Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the middle
LINE 333: of the assembly, and Medon said, "Hear me, men of Ithaca. Ulysses did
LINE 334: not d'these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an
LINE 335: immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god
LINE 336: appeared, now in front of him encouraging him, and now going furiously
LINE 337: about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on
LINE 338: one another."
LINE 339: On this pale fear laid hold of them, and old Halitherses, son of
LINE 340: Mastor, rose t'speak, for he was the only man among them wh'knew both
LINE 341: past and future; s'he spoke t'them plainly and in all honesty,
LINE 342: saying,
LINE 343: "Men of Ithaca, it is all your own fault that things have turned out as
LINE 344: they have; you would not listen t'me, nor yet t'Mentor, when we bade
LINE 345: you check the folly of your sons wh'were doing much wrong in the
LINE 346: wantonness of their hearts—wasting the substance and dishonouring the
LINE 347: wife of a chieftain wh'they thought would not return. Now, however,
LINE 348: let it be as I say, and d'as I tell you. D'not g'out against
LINE 349: Ulysses, or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your
LINE 350: own heads."
LINE 351: This was what he said, and more than half raised a loud shout, and at
LINE 352: once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were, for the
LINE 353: speech of Halitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes;
LINE 354: they therefore hurried off for their armour, and when they had armed
LINE 355: themselves, they met together in front of the city, and Eupeithes led
LINE 356: them on in their folly. He thought he was going t'avenge the murder of
LINE 357: his son, whereas in truth he was never t'return, but was himself to
LINE 358: perish in his attempt.
LINE 359: Then Minerva said t'Jove, "Father, son of Saturn, king of kings,
LINE 360: answer me this question—What d'you propose t'do? Will you set them
LINE 361: fighting still further, or will you make peace between them?"
LINE 362: And Jove answered, "My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your
LINE 363: own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the
LINE 364: suitors? D'whatever you like, but I will tell you what I think will be
LINE 365: most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged, let them
LINE 366: swear t'a solemn covenant, in virtue of which he shall continue to
LINE 367: rule, while we cause the others t'forgive and forget the massacre of
LINE 368: their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as
LINE 369: heretofore, and let peace and plenty reign."
LINE 370: This was what Minerva was already eager t'bring about, s'down she
LINE 371: darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.
LINE 372: Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner, Ulysses began by
LINE 373: saying, "Some of you g'out and see if they are not getting close up to
LINE 374: us." S'one of Dolius's sons went as he was bid. Standing on the
LINE 375: threshold he could see them all quite near, and said t'Ulysses, "Here
LINE 376: they are, let us put on our armour at once."
LINE 377: They put on their armour as fast as they could—that is t'say Ulysses,
LINE 378: his three men, and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes als'and Dolius did
LINE 379: the same—warriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they
LINE 380: had all put on their armour, they opened the gate and sallied forth,
LINE 381: Ulysses leading the way.
LINE 382: Then Jove's daughter Minerva came up t'them, having assumed the form
LINE 383: and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her, and said t'his
LINE 384: son Telemachus, "Telemachus, now that you are about t'fight in an
LINE 385: engagement, which will show every man's mettle, be sure not t'disgrace
LINE 386: your ancestors, wh'were eminent for their strength and courage all the
LINE 387: world over."
LINE 388: "You say truly, my dear father," answered Telemachus, "and you shall
LINE 389: see, if you will, that I am in n'mind t'disgrace your family."
LINE 390: Laertes was delighted when he heard this. "Good heavens," he exclaimed,
LINE 391: "what a day I am enjoying: I d'indeed rejoice at it. My son and
LINE 392: grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour."
LINE 393: On this Minerva came close up t'him and said, "Son of Arceisius—-best
LINE 394: friend I have in the world—pray t'the blue-eyed damsel, and t'Jove
LINE 395: her father; then poise your spear and hurl it."
LINE 396: As she spoke she infused fresh vigour int'him, and when he had prayed
LINE 397: t'her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes' helmet, and
LINE 398: the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed it not, and his
LINE 399: armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily t'the ground.
LINE 400: Meantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and
LINE 401: smote them with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed
LINE 402: every one of them, and prevented them from ever getting home again,
LINE 403: only Minerva raised her voice aloud, and made every one pause. "Men of
LINE 404: Ithaca," she cried, "cease this dreadful war, and settle the matter at
LINE 405: once without further bloodshed."
LINE 406: On this pale fear seized every one; they were s'frightened that their
LINE 407: arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of
LINE 408: the goddess' voice, and they fled back t'the city for their lives. But
LINE 409: Ulysses gave a great cry, and gathering himself together swooped down
LINE 410: like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire
LINE 411: that fell just in front of Minerva, s'she said t'Ulysses, "Ulysses,
LINE 412: noble son of Laertes, stop this warful strife, or Jove will be angry
LINE 413: with you."
LINE 414: Thus spoke Minerva, and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed
LINE 415: the form and voice of Mentor, and presently made a covenant of peace
LINE 416: between the tw'contending parties.
