LINE 1: ULYSSES CANNOT SLEEP—PENELOPE'S PRAYER T'DIANA—THE TW'SIGNS FROM
LINE 2: HEAVEN—EUMAEUS AND PHILOETIUS ARRIVE—THE SUITORS DINE—CTESIPPUS THROWS
LINE 3: AN OX'S FOOT AT ULYSSES—THEOCLYMENUS FORETELLS DISASTER AND LEAVES THE
LINE 4: HOUSE.
LINE 5: Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock's hide, on the
LINE 6: top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten,
LINE 7: and Eurynome156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down.
LINE 8: There, then, Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he
LINE 9: should kill the suitors; and by and by, the women wh'had been in the
LINE 10: habit of misconducting themselves with them, left the house giggling
LINE 11: and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry, and he
LINE 12: doubted whether t'get up and kill every single one of them then and
LINE 13: there, or t'let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors.
LINE 14: His heart growled within him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and
LINE 15: shows her teeth when she sees a stranger, s'did his heart growl with
LINE 16: anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast
LINE 17: and said, "Heart, be still, you had worse than this t'bear on the day
LINE 18: when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in
LINE 19: silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made
LINE 20: sure of being killed."
LINE 21: Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it int'endurance, but he
LINE 22: tossed about as one wh'turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front
LINE 23: of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other, that
LINE 24: he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even s'did he turn himself
LINE 25: about from side t'side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he
LINE 26: was, he should contrive t'kill s'large a body of men as the wicked
LINE 27: suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of
LINE 28: a woman, and hovered over his head saying, "My poor unhappy man, why do
LINE 29: you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside
LINE 30: it, and s'is your son wh'is just such a young man as any father may
LINE 31: be proud of."
LINE 32: "Goddess," answered Ulysses, "all that you have said is true, but I am
LINE 33: in some doubt as t'how I shall be able t'kill these wicked suitors
LINE 34: single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are. And there
LINE 35: is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable. Supposing
LINE 36: that with Jove's and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must
LINE 37: ask you t'consider where I am t'escape t'from their avengers when it
LINE 38: is all over."
LINE 39: "For shame," replied Minerva, "why, any one else would trust a worse
LINE 40: ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal and less
LINE 41: wise than I am. Am I not a goddess, and have I not protected you
LINE 42: throughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though
LINE 43: there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager t'kill us, you
LINE 44: should take all their sheep and cattle, and drive them away with you.
LINE 45: But g't'sleep; it is a very bad thing t'lie awake all night, and you
LINE 46: shall be out of your troubles before long."
LINE 47: As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes, and then went back to
LINE 48: Olympus.
LINE 49: While Ulysses was thus yielding himself t'a very deep slumber that
LINE 50: eased the burden of his sorrows, his admirable wife awoke, and sitting
LINE 51: up in her bed began t'cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping
LINE 52: she prayed t'Diana saying, "Great Goddess Diana, daughter of Jove,
LINE 53: drive an arrow int'my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch
LINE 54: me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me int'the
LINE 55: mouths of over-flowing Oceanus, as it did the daughters of Pandareus.
LINE 56: The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother, for the gods
LINE 57: killed them, s'they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them,
LINE 58: and fed them on cheese, honey, and sweet wine. Jun'taught them to
LINE 59: excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an
LINE 60: imposing presence, and Minerva endowed them with every kind of
LINE 61: accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up t'Olympus t'see
LINE 62: Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall
LINE 63: happen and what not happen t'every one) the storm winds came and
LINE 64: spirited them away t'become handmaids t'the dread Erinyes. Even s'I
LINE 65: wish that the gods wh'live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight,
LINE 66: or that fair Diana might strike me, for I would fain g'even beneath
LINE 67: the sad earth if I might d's'still looking towards Ulysses only, and
LINE 68: without having t'yield myself t'a worse man than he was. Besides, no
LINE 69: matter how much people may grieve by day, they can put up with it so
LINE 70: long as they can sleep at night, for when the eyes are closed in
LINE 71: slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me
LINE 72: even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my
LINE 73: side wh'was like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host,
LINE 74: and I rejoiced, for I believed that it was n'dream, but the very truth
LINE 75: itself."
LINE 76: On this the day broke, but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping, and
LINE 77: it puzzled him, for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by
LINE 78: his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had
LINE 79: lain, and set them on a seat in the cloister, but he took the bullock's
LINE 80: hide out int'the open. He lifted up his hands t'heaven, and prayed,
LINE 81: saying "Father Jove, since you have seen fit t'bring me over land and
LINE 82: sea t'my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me,
LINE 83: give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those wh'are
LINE 84: now waking within the house, and let me have another sign of some kind
LINE 85: from outside."
LINE 86: Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up
LINE 87: among the clouds from the splendour of Olympus, and Ulysses was glad
LINE 88: when he heard it. At the same time within the house, a miller-woman
LINE 89: from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another
LINE 90: sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was t'grind
LINE 91: wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground
LINE 92: their task and had gone t'take their rest, but this one had not yet
LINE 93: finished, for she was not s'strong as they were, and when she heard
LINE 94: the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign t'her master.
LINE 95: "Father Jove," said she, "you, wh'rule over heaven and earth, you have
LINE 96: thundered from a clear sky without s'much as a cloud in it, and this
LINE 97: means something for somebody; grant the prayer, then, of me your poor
LINE 98: servant wh'calls upon you, and let this be the very last day that the
LINE 99: suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour
LINE 100: of grinding meal for them, and I hope they may never have another
LINE 101: dinner anywhere at all."
LINE 102: Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed t'him by the woman's
LINE 103: speech, and by the thunder, for he knew they meant that he should
LINE 104: avenge himself on the suitors.
LINE 105: Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;
LINE 106: Telemachus als'rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about
LINE 107: his shoulder, bound his sandals on t'his comely feet, and took a
LINE 108: doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went t'the
LINE 109: threshold of the cloister and said t'Euryclea, "Nurse, did you make
LINE 110: the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board, or did you let
LINE 111: him shift for himself?—for my mother, good woman though she is, has a
LINE 112: way of paying great attention t'second-rate people, and of neglecting
LINE 113: others wh'are in reality much better men."
LINE 114: "D'not find fault child," said Euryclea, "when there is n'one t'find
LINE 115: fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked:
LINE 116: your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he
LINE 117: would not. When he wanted t'g't'bed she told the servants t'make
LINE 118: one for him, but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would
LINE 119: not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an
LINE 120: undressed bullock's hide and some sheepskins put for him in the
LINE 121: cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself."157
LINE 122: Then Telemachus went out of the court t'the place where the Achaeans
LINE 123: were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand, and he was not
LINE 124: alone, for his tw'dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids
LINE 125: and said, "Come, wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and
LINE 126: sprinkling them with water t'lay the dust; put the covers on the
LINE 127: seats; wipe down the tables, some of you, with a wet sponge; clean out
LINE 128: the mixing-jugs and the cups, and g'for water from the fountain at
LINE 129: once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early, for
LINE 130: it is a feast day."
LINE 131: Thus did she speak, and they did even as she had said: twenty of them
LINE 132: went t'the fountain for water, and the others set themselves busily to
LINE 133: work about the house. The men wh'were in attendance on the suitors
LINE 134: als'came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned
LINE 135: from the fountain, and the swineherd came after them with the three
LINE 136: best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises, and
LINE 137: then he said good-humouredly t'Ulysses, "Stranger, are the suitors
LINE 138: treating you any better now, or are they as insolent as ever?"
LINE 139: "May heaven," answered Ulysses, "requite t'them the wickedness with
LINE 140: which they deal high-handedly in another man's house without any sense
LINE 141: of shame."
LINE 142: Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for
LINE 143: he to'was bringing in his best goats for the suitors' dinner; and he
LINE 144: had tw'shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,
LINE 145: and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. "Are you still here,
LINE 146: stranger," said he, "t'pester people by begging about the house? Why
LINE 147: can you not g'elsewhere? You and I shall not come t'an understanding
LINE 148: before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without
LINE 149: any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the
LINE 150: Achaeans, as well as here?"
LINE 151: Ulysses made n'answer, but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third
LINE 152: man, Philoetius, joined them, wh'was bringing in a barren heifer and
LINE 153: some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen wh'are there to
LINE 154: take people over when any one comes t'them. S'Philoetius made his
LINE 155: heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse, and then went up to
LINE 156: the swineherd. "Who, Swineherd," said he, "is this stranger that is
LINE 157: lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does
LINE 158: he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some great man,
LINE 159: but the gods give sorrow t'whom they will—even t'kings if it so
LINE 160: pleases them."
LINE 161: As he spoke he went up t'Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;
LINE 162: "Good day t'you, father stranger," said he, "you seem t'be very
LINE 163: poorly off now, but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father
LINE 164: Jove, of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,
LINE 165: yet you show us n'mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat
LINE 166: came over me when I saw this man, and my eyes filled with tears, for he
LINE 167: reminds me of Ulysses, wh'I fear is going about in just such rags as
LINE 168: this man's are, if indeed he is still among the living. If he is
LINE 169: already dead and in the house of Hades, then, alas! for my good master,
LINE 170: wh'made me his stockman when I was quite young among the
LINE 171: Cephallenians, and now his cattle are countless; n'one could have done
LINE 172: better with them than I have, for they have bred like ears of corn;
LINE 173: nevertheless I have t'keep bringing them in for others t'eat, who
LINE 174: take n'heed t'his son though he is in the house, and fear not the
LINE 175: wrath of heaven, but are already eager t'divide Ulysses' property
LINE 176: among them because he has been away s'long. I have often thought—only
LINE 177: it would not be right while his son is living—of going off with the
LINE 178: cattle t'some foreign country; bad as this would be, it is still
LINE 179: harder t'stay here and be ill-treated about other people's herds. My
LINE 180: position is intolerable, and I should long since have run away and put
LINE 181: myself under the protection of some other chief, only that I believe my
LINE 182: poor master will yet return, and send all these suitors flying out of
LINE 183: the house."
LINE 184: "Stockman," answered Ulysses, "you seem t'be a very well-disposed
LINE 185: person, and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will
LINE 186: tell you, and will confirm my words with an oath. By Jove, the chief of
LINE 187: all gods, and by that hearth of Ulysses t'which I am now come, Ulysses
LINE 188: shall return before you leave this place, and if you are s'minded you
LINE 189: shall see him killing the suitors wh'are now masters here."
LINE 190: "If Jove were t'bring this t'pass," replied the stockman, "you should
LINE 191: see how I would d'my very utmost t'help him."
LINE 192: And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.
LINE 193: Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to
LINE 194: murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand—an
LINE 195: eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said, "My friends,
LINE 196: this plot of ours t'murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us g'to
LINE 197: dinner instead."
LINE 198: The others assented, s'they went inside and laid their cloaks on the
LINE 199: benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep, goats, pigs, and the
LINE 200: heifer, and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round.
LINE 201: They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls, and the swineherd gave every
LINE 202: man his cup, while Philoetius handed round the bread in the bread
LINE 203: baskets, and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid
LINE 204: their hands upon the good things that were before them.
LINE 205: Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that
LINE 206: was paved with stone;158 he gave him a shabby looking seat at a little
LINE 207: table t'himself, and had his portion of the inward meats brought to
LINE 208: him, with his wine in a gold cup. "Sit there," said he, "and drink your
LINE 209: wine among the great people. I will put a stop t'the gibes and blows
LINE 210: of the suitors, for this is n'public house, but belongs t'Ulysses,
LINE 211: and has passed from him t'me. Therefore, suitors, keep your hands and
LINE 212: your tongues t'yourselves, or there will be mischief."
LINE 213: The suitors bit their lips, and marvelled at the boldness of his
LINE 214: speech; then Antinous said, "We d'not like such language but we will
LINE 215: put up with it, for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If
LINE 216: Jove had let us we should have put a stop t'his brave talk ere now."
LINE 217: Thus spoke Antinous, but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the
LINE 218: heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city, and the
LINE 219: Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.
LINE 220: Then they roasted the outer meat, drew it off the spits, gave every man
LINE 221: his portion, and feasted t'their heart's content; those wh'waited at
LINE 222: table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had, for
LINE 223: Telemachus had told them t'd'so.
LINE 224: But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their
LINE 225: insolence, for she wanted Ulysses t'become still more bitter against
LINE 226: them. Now there happened t'be among them a ribald fellow, whose name
LINE 227: was Ctesippus, and wh'came from Same. This man, confident in his great
LINE 228: wealth, was paying court t'the wife of Ulysses, and said t'the
LINE 229: suitors, "Hear what I have t'say. The stranger has already had as
LINE 230: large a portion as any one else; this is well, for it is not right nor
LINE 231: reasonable t'ill-treat any guest of Telemachus wh'comes here. I will,
LINE 232: however, make him a present on my own account, that he may have
LINE 233: something t'give t'the bath-woman, or t'some other of Ulysses'
LINE 234: servants."
LINE 235: As he spoke he picked up a heifer's foot from the meat-basket in which
LINE 236: it lay, and threw it at Ulysses, but Ulysses turned his head a little
LINE 237: aside, and avoided it, smiling grimly Sardinian fashion159 as he did
LINE 238: so, and it hit the wall, not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to
LINE 239: Ctesippus, "It is a good thing for you," said he, "that the stranger
LINE 240: turned his head s'that you missed him. If you had hit him I should
LINE 241: have run you through with my spear, and your father would have had to
LINE 242: see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. S'let
LINE 243: me have n'more unseemly behaviour from any of you, for I am grown up
LINE 244: now t'the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,
LINE 245: instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long
LINE 246: seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have
LINE 247: put up with this, for one man is n'match for many, but d'me no
LINE 248: further violence. Still, if you wish t'kill me, kill me; I would far
LINE 249: rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day—guests
LINE 250: insulted, and men dragging the women servants about the house in an
LINE 251: unseemly way."
LINE 252: They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,
LINE 253: "N'one should take offence at what has just been said, nor gainsay it,
LINE 254: for it is quite reasonable. Leave off, therefore, ill-treating the
LINE 255: stranger, or any one else of the servants wh'are about the house; I
LINE 256: would say, however, a friendly word t'Telemachus and his mother, which
LINE 257: I trust may commend itself t'both. 'As long,' I would say, 'as you had
LINE 258: ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home, n'one could
LINE 259: complain of your waiting and suffering160 the suitors t'be in your
LINE 260: house. It would have been better that he should have returned, but it
LINE 261: is now sufficiently clear that he will never d'so; therefore talk all
LINE 262: this quietly over with your mother, and tell her t'marry the best man,
LINE 263: and the one wh'makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will
LINE 264: yourself be able t'manage your own inheritance, and t'eat and drink
LINE 265: in peace, while your mother will look after some other man's house, not
LINE 266: yours.'"
LINE 267: T'this Telemachus answered, "By Jove, Agelaus, and by the sorrows of
LINE 268: my unhappy father, wh'has either perished far from Ithaca, or is
LINE 269: wandering in some distant land, I throw n'obstacles in the way of my
LINE 270: mother's marriage; on the contrary I urge her t'choose whomsoever she
LINE 271: will, and I will give her numberless gifts int'the bargain, but I dare
LINE 272: not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own
LINE 273: wishes. Heaven forbid that I should d'this."
LINE 274: Minerva now made the suitors fall t'laughing immoderately, and set
LINE 275: their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.
LINE 276: Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears, and
LINE 277: their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and
LINE 278: said, "Unhappy men, what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of
LINE 279: darkness drawn over you from head t'foot, your cheeks are wet with
LINE 280: tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams
LINE 281: drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are
LINE 282: full of ghosts trooping down int'the night of hell; the sun is blotted
LINE 283: out of heaven, and a blighting gloom is over all the land."
LINE 284: Thus did he speak, and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus
LINE 285: then said, "This stranger wh'has lately come here has lost his senses.
LINE 286: Servants, turn him out int'the streets, since he finds it s'dark
LINE 287: here."
LINE 288: But Theoclymenus said, "Eurymachus, you need not send any one with me.
LINE 289: I have eyes, ears, and a pair of feet of my own, t'say nothing of an
LINE 290: understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me, for I
LINE 291: see mischief overhanging you, from which not one of you men wh'are
LINE 292: insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be
LINE 293: able t'escape."
LINE 294: He left the house as he spoke, and went back t'Piraeus wh'gave him
LINE 295: welcome, but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking
LINE 296: Telemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to
LINE 297: him, "Telemachus, you are not happy in your guests; first you have this
LINE 298: importunate tramp, wh'comes begging bread and wine and has n'skill
LINE 299: for work or for hard fighting, but is perfectly useless, and now here
LINE 300: is another fellow wh'is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me
LINE 301: persuade you, for it will be much better t'put them on board ship and
LINE 302: send them off t'the Sicels t'sell for what they will bring."
LINE 303: Telemachus gave him n'heed, but sat silently watching his father,
LINE 304: expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.
LINE 305: Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had had a rich seat
LINE 306: placed for her facing the court and cloisters, s'that she could hear
LINE 307: what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid
LINE 308: much merriment; it had been both good and abundant, for they had
LINE 309: sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet t'come, and nothing
LINE 310: can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a
LINE 311: brave man were soon t'lay before them—for they had brought their doom
LINE 312: upon themselves.
