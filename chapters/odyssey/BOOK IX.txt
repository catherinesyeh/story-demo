LINE 1: ULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY—-THE CICONS, LOTOPHAGI,
LINE 2: AND CYCLOPES.
LINE 3: And Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous, it is a good thing t'hear a bard
LINE 4: with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or
LINE 5: more delightful than when a whole people make merry together, with the
LINE 6: guests sitting orderly t'listen, while the table is loaded with bread
LINE 7: and meats, and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every
LINE 8: man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however,
LINE 9: since you are inclined t'ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my
LINE 10: own sad memories in respect of them, I d'not know how t'begin, nor
LINE 11: yet how t'continue and conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has
LINE 12: been laid heavily upon me.
LINE 13: "Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you to'may know it, and
LINE 14: one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, may become my guests though
LINE 15: I live s'far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,
LINE 16: renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety, s'that my fame
LINE 17: ascends t'heaven. I live in Ithaca, where there is a high mountain
LINE 18: called Neritum, covered with forests; and not far from it there is a
LINE 19: group of islands very near t'one another—Dulichium, Same, and the
LINE 20: wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon, all highest
LINE 21: up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it
LINE 22: towards dawn.75 It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my
LINE 23: eyes know none that they better love t'look upon. The goddess Calypso
LINE 24: kept me with her in her cave, and wanted me t'marry her, as did also
LINE 25: the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them
LINE 26: persuade me, for there is nothing dearer t'a man than his own country
LINE 27: and his parents, and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign
LINE 28: country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not care about it.
LINE 29: Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by
LINE 30: Jove's will I met with on my return from Troy.
LINE 31: "When I had set sail thence the wind took me first t'Ismarus, which is
LINE 32: the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to
LINE 33: the sword. We took their wives and als'much booty, which we divided
LINE 34: equitably amongst us, s'that none might have reason t'complain. I
LINE 35: then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very
LINE 36: foolishly would not obey me, s'they staid there drinking much wine and
LINE 37: killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the
LINE 38: Cicons cried out for help t'other Cicons wh'lived inland. These were
LINE 39: more in number, and stronger, and they were more skilled in the art of
LINE 40: war, for they could fight, either from chariots or on foot as the
LINE 41: occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they came as thick as
LINE 42: leaves and bloom in summer, and the hand of heaven was against us, so
LINE 43: that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships,
LINE 44: and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.76 S'long
LINE 45: as the day waxed and it was still morning, we held our own against
LINE 46: them, though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went
LINE 47: down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Cicons got the
LINE 48: better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so
LINE 49: we got away with those that were left.
LINE 50: "Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts, but glad t'have
LINE 51: escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did we leave till we
LINE 52: had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows wh'had perished by the
LINE 53: hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it
LINE 54: blew a hurricane, s'that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and
LINE 55: night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the
LINE 56: gale, but the force of the wind tore our sails t'tatters, s'we took
LINE 57: them down for fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the
LINE 58: land. There we lay tw'days and tw'nights suffering much alike from
LINE 59: toil and distress of mind, but on the morning of the third day we again
LINE 60: raised our masts, set sail, and took our places, letting the wind and
LINE 61: steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed
LINE 62: had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was
LINE 63: doubling Cape Malea, and set me off my course hard by the island of
LINE 64: Cythera.
LINE 65: "I was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the
LINE 66: sea, but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters, who
LINE 67: live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed t'take
LINE 68: in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near
LINE 69: the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent tw'of my company to
LINE 70: see what manner of men the people of the place might be, and they had a
LINE 71: third man under them. They started at once, and went about among the
LINE 72: Lotus-eaters, wh'did them n'hurt, but gave them t'eat of the lotus,
LINE 73: which was s'delicious that those wh'ate of it left off caring about
LINE 74: home, and did not even want t'g'back and say what had happened to
LINE 75: them, but were for staying and munching lotus77 with the Lotus-eaters
LINE 76: without thinking further of their return; nevertheless, though they
LINE 77: wept bitterly I forced them back t'the ships and made them fast under
LINE 78: the benches. Then I told the rest t'g'on board at once, lest any of
LINE 79: them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting t'get home, so
LINE 80: they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.
LINE 81: "We sailed hence, always in much distress, till we came t'the land of
LINE 82: the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor
LINE 83: plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat, barley, and
LINE 84: grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild grapes
LINE 85: yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no
LINE 86: laws nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of
LINE 87: high mountains; each is lord and master in his family, and they take no
LINE 88: account of their neighbours.
LINE 89: "Now off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite
LINE 90: close t'the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far. It is over-run
LINE 91: with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never
LINE 92: disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen—wh'as a rule will suffer so
LINE 93: much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices—d'not g'there,
LINE 94: nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness
LINE 95: untilled and unsown from year t'year, and has n'living thing upon it
LINE 96: but only goats. For the Cyclopes have n'ships, nor yet shipwrights who
LINE 97: could make ships for them; they cannot therefore g'from city t'city,
LINE 98: or sail over the sea t'one another's country as people wh'have ships
LINE 99: can do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island,78
LINE 100: for it is a very good one, and would yield everything in due season.
LINE 101: There are meadows that in some places come right down t'the sea shore,
LINE 102: well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would d'there
LINE 103: excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always
LINE 104: yield heavily at harvest time, for the soil is deep. There is a good
LINE 105: harbour where n'cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor need a ship be
LINE 106: moored, but all one has t'd'is t'beach one's vessel and stay there
LINE 107: till the wind becomes fair for putting out t'sea again. At the head of
LINE 108: the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and
LINE 109: there are poplars growing all round it.
LINE 110: "Here we entered, but s'dark was the night that some god must have
LINE 111: brought us in, for there was nothing whatever t'be seen. A thick mist
LINE 112: hung all round our ships;79 the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds
LINE 113: s'that n'one could have seen the island if he had looked for it, nor
LINE 114: were there any breakers t'tell us we were close in shore before we
LINE 115: found ourselves upon the land itself; when, however, we had beached the
LINE 116: ships, we took down the sails, went ashore and camped upon the beach
LINE 117: till daybreak.
LINE 118: "When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, we admired the
LINE 119: island and wandered all over it, while the nymphs Jove's daughters
LINE 120: roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On
LINE 121: this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and
LINE 122: dividing ourselves int'three bands began t'shoot the goats. Heaven
LINE 123: sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got
LINE 124: nine goats, while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to
LINE 125: the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill, and we had plenty
LINE 126: of wine left, for each one of us had taken many jars full when we
LINE 127: sacked the city of the Cicons, and this had not yet run out. While we
LINE 128: were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the
LINE 129: Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their stubble fires.
LINE 130: We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their
LINE 131: sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we
LINE 132: camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.
LINE 133: "'Stay here, my brave fellows,' said I, 'all the rest of you, while I
LINE 134: g'with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want t'see if they
LINE 135: are uncivilised savages, or a hospitable and humane race.'
LINE 136: "I went on board, bidding my men t'd's'als'and loose the hawsers;
LINE 137: s'they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When
LINE 138: we got t'the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a cliff
LINE 139: near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a
LINE 140: station for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large
LINE 141: yard, with a high wall round it made of stones built int'the ground
LINE 142: and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster
LINE 143: wh'was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have
LINE 144: nothing t'd'with other people, but led the life of an outlaw. He was
LINE 145: a horrid creature, not like a human being at all, but resembling rather
LINE 146: some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high
LINE 147: mountain.
LINE 148: "I told my men t'draw the ship ashore, and stay where they were, all
LINE 149: but the twelve best among them, wh'were t'g'along with myself. I
LINE 150: als'took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by
LINE 151: Maron, son of Euanthes, wh'was priest of Apoll'the patron god of
LINE 152: Ismarus, and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we
LINE 153: were sacking the city we respected him, and spared his life, as also
LINE 154: his wife and child; s'he made me some presents of great value—seven
LINE 155: talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver, with twelve jars of sweet
LINE 156: wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid
LINE 157: in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and one
LINE 158: housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water t'one of
LINE 159: wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was s'exquisite that
LINE 160: it was impossible t'refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with
LINE 161: this wine, and took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind
LINE 162: misgave me that I might have t'deal with some savage wh'would be of
LINE 163: great strength, and would respect neither right nor law.
LINE 164: "We soon reached his cave, but he was out shepherding, s'we went
LINE 165: inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were
LINE 166: loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could
LINE 167: hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets,
LINE 168: then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones80
LINE 169: all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels,
LINE 170: bowls, and milk pails int'which he milked, were swimming with whey.
LINE 171: When they saw all this, my men begged me t'let them first steal some
LINE 172: cheeses, and make off with them t'the ship; they would then return,
LINE 173: drive down the lambs and kids, put them on board and sail away with
LINE 174: them. It would have been indeed better if we had done s'but I would
LINE 175: not listen t'them, for I wanted t'see the owner himself, in the hope
LINE 176: that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him my poor men
LINE 177: found him ill t'deal with.
LINE 178: "We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice, ate others of
LINE 179: them, and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his
LINE 180: sheep. When he came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood
LINE 181: t'light the fire for his supper, and this he flung with such a noise
LINE 182: on t'the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far
LINE 183: end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside, as well as
LINE 184: the she-goats that he was going t'milk, leaving the males, both rams
LINE 185: and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone t'the
LINE 186: mouth of the cave—s'huge that tw'and twenty strong four-wheeled
LINE 187: waggons would not be enough t'draw it from its place against the
LINE 188: doorway. When he had s'done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats,
LINE 189: all in due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He
LINE 190: curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the
LINE 191: other half he poured int'bowls that he might drink it for his supper.
LINE 192: When he had got through with all his work, he lit the fire, and then
LINE 193: caught sight of us, whereon he said:
LINE 194: "'Strangers, wh'are you? Where d'sail from? Are you traders, or do
LINE 195: you sail the sea as rovers, with your hands against every man, and
LINE 196: every man's hand against you?'
LINE 197: "We were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous
LINE 198: form, but I managed t'say, 'We are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,
LINE 199: but by the will of Jove, and stress of weather, we have been driven far
LINE 200: out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, who
LINE 201: has won infinite renown throughout the whole world, by sacking s'great
LINE 202: a city and killing s'many people. We therefore humbly pray you t'show
LINE 203: us some hospitality, and otherwise make us such presents as visitors
LINE 204: may reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven,
LINE 205: for we are your suppliants, and Jove takes all respectable travellers
LINE 206: under his protection, for he is the avenger of all suppliants and
LINE 207: foreigners in distress.'
LINE 208: "T'this he gave me but a pitiless answer, 'Stranger,' said he, 'you
LINE 209: are a fool, or else you know nothing of this country. Talk t'me,
LINE 210: indeed, about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do
LINE 211: not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods, for we are ever so
LINE 212: much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your
LINE 213: companions out of any regard for Jove, unless I am in the humour for
LINE 214: doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came
LINE 215: on shore. Was it round the point, or is she lying straight off the
LINE 216: land?'
LINE 217: "He said this t'draw me out, but I was to'cunning t'be caught in
LINE 218: that way, s'I answered with a lie; 'Neptune,' said I, 'sent my ship on
LINE 219: t'the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it. We were
LINE 220: driven on t'them from the open sea, but I and those wh'are with me
LINE 221: escaped the jaws of death.'
LINE 222: "The cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer, but with a
LINE 223: sudden clutch he gripped up tw'of my men at once and dashed them down
LINE 224: upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed
LINE 225: upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore
LINE 226: them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a
LINE 227: lion in the wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without
LINE 228: leaving anything uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to
LINE 229: heaven on seeing such a horrid sight, for we did not know what else to
LINE 230: do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch, and had washed
LINE 231: down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched
LINE 232: himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went t'sleep.
LINE 233: I was at first inclined t'seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into
LINE 234: his vitals, but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be
LINE 235: lost, for we should never be able t'shift the stone which the monster
LINE 236: had put in front of the door. S'we stayed sobbing and sighing where we
LINE 237: were till morning came.
LINE 238: "When the child of morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, he again lit
LINE 239: his fire, milked his goats and ewes, all quite rightly, and then let
LINE 240: each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his
LINE 241: work, he clutched up tw'more of my men, and began eating them for his
LINE 242: morning's meal. Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone
LINE 243: away from the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back
LINE 244: again—as easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on t'a
LINE 245: quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done s'he shouted, and cried
LINE 246: 'Shoo, shoo,' after his sheep t'drive them on t'the mountain; s'I
LINE 247: was left t'scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself
LINE 248: with glory.
LINE 249: "In the end I deemed it would be the best plan t'd'as follows: The
LINE 250: Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it
LINE 251: was of green olive wood, and he had cut it intending t'use it for a
LINE 252: staff as soon as it should be dry. It was s'huge that we could only
LINE 253: compare it t'the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large
LINE 254: burden, and able t'venture out int'open sea. I went up t'this club
LINE 255: and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece t'the men and
LINE 256: told them t'fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded t'do,
LINE 257: and lastly I brought it t'a point myself, charring the end in the fire
LINE 258: t'make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was
LINE 259: lying about all over the cave, and told the men t'cast lots which of
LINE 260: them should venture along with myself t'lift it and bore it int'the
LINE 261: monster's eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom
LINE 262: I should have chosen, and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch
LINE 263: came back from shepherding, and drove his flocks int'the cave—this
LINE 264: time driving them all inside, and not leaving any in the yards; I
LINE 265: suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have prompted him
LINE 266: t'd'so. As soon as he had put the stone back t'its place against the
LINE 267: door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly, and
LINE 268: then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all
LINE 269: this work, he gripped up tw'more of my men, and made his supper off
LINE 270: them. S'I went up t'him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my
LINE 271: hands:
LINE 272: "'Look here, Cyclops,' said I, you have been eating a great deal of
LINE 273: man's flesh, s'take this and drink some wine, that you may see what
LINE 274: kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it t'you as a
LINE 275: drink-offering, in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and
LINE 276: further me on my way home, whereas all you d'is t'g'on ramping and
LINE 277: raving most intolerably. You ought t'be ashamed of yourself; how can
LINE 278: you expect people t'come see you any more if you treat them in this
LINE 279: way?'
LINE 280: "He then took the cup and drank. He was s'delighted with the taste of
LINE 281: the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. 'Be s'kind,' he
LINE 282: said, 'as t'give me some more, and tell me your name at once. I want
LINE 283: t'make you a present that you will be glad t'have. We have wine even
LINE 284: in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but
LINE 285: this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.'
LINE 286: "I then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,
LINE 287: and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then, when I
LINE 288: saw that the wine had got int'his head, I said t'him as plausibly as
LINE 289: I could: 'Cyclops, you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,
LINE 290: therefore, the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what
LINE 291: my father and mother and my friends have always called me.'
LINE 292: "But the cruel wretch said, 'Then I will eat all Noman's comrades
LINE 293: before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is the
LINE 294: present that I will make him.'
LINE 295: "As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.
LINE 296: His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon
LINE 297: him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the gobbets
LINE 298: of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.
LINE 299: Then I thrust the beam of wood far int'the embers t'heat it, and
LINE 300: encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the
LINE 301: wood, green though it was, was about t'blaze, I drew it out of the
LINE 302: fire glowing with heat, and my men gathered round me, for heaven had
LINE 303: filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam
LINE 304: int'the monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept
LINE 305: turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's
LINE 306: plank with an auger, which tw'men with a wheel and strap can keep on
LINE 307: turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam
LINE 308: int'his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked
LINE 309: it round and round, s'that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded
LINE 310: his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in the
LINE 311: fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet int'cold water to
LINE 312: temper it—for it is this that gives strength t'the iron—and it makes a
LINE 313: great hiss as he does so, even thus did the Cyclops' eye hiss round the
LINE 314: beam of olive wood, and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We
LINE 315: ran away in a fright, but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore
LINE 316: from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain,
LINE 317: shouting as he did s't'the other Cyclopes wh'lived on the bleak
LINE 318: headlands near him; s'they gathered from all quarters round his cave
LINE 319: when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.
LINE 320: "'What ails you, Polyphemus,' said they, 'that you make such a noise,
LINE 321: breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us from being able
LINE 322: t'sleep? Surely n'man is carrying off your sheep? Surely n'man is
LINE 323: trying t'kill you either by fraud or by force?'
LINE 324: "But Polyphemus shouted t'them from inside the cave, 'Noman is killing
LINE 325: me by fraud; n'man is killing me by force.'
LINE 326: "'Then,' said they, 'if n'man is attacking you, you must be ill; when
LINE 327: Jove makes people ill, there is n'help for it, and you had better pray
LINE 328: t'your father Neptune.'
LINE 329: "Then they went away, and I laughed inwardly at the success of my
LINE 330: clever stratagem, but the Cyclops, groaning and in an agony of pain,
LINE 331: felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the
LINE 332: door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it
LINE 333: t'catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought I might be
LINE 334: foolish enough t'attempt this.
LINE 335: "As for myself I kept on puzzling t'think how I could best save my own
LINE 336: life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed, as one who
LINE 337: knows that his life depends upon it, for the danger was very great. In
LINE 338: the end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were
LINE 339: well grown, and carried a heavy black fleece, s'I bound them
LINE 340: noiselessly in threes together, with some of the withies on which the
LINE 341: wicked monster used t'sleep. There was t'be a man under the middle
LINE 342: sheep, and the tw'on either side were t'cover him, s'that there were
LINE 343: three sheep t'each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any
LINE 344: of the others, s'I caught hold of him by the back, esconced myself in
LINE 345: the thick wool under his belly, and hung on patiently t'his fleece,
LINE 346: face upwards, keeping a firm hold on it all the time.
LINE 347: "Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came, but
LINE 348: when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, the male sheep
LINE 349: hurried out t'feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the pens
LINE 350: waiting t'be milked, for their udders were full t'bursting; but their
LINE 351: master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they
LINE 352: stood upright, without being sharp enough t'find out that the men were
LINE 353: underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy
LINE 354: with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self, Polyphemus laid
LINE 355: hold of it and said:
LINE 356: "'My good ram, what is it that makes you the last t'leave my cave this
LINE 357: morning? You are not wont t'let the ewes g'before you, but lead the
LINE 358: mob with a run whether t'flowery mead or bubbling fountain, and are
LINE 359: the first t'come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is
LINE 360: it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because
LINE 361: that wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and
LINE 362: blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and
LINE 363: talk, you would tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash
LINE 364: his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should
LINE 365: thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done
LINE 366: me.'
LINE 367: "As he spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we were a little way
LINE 368: out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's belly,
LINE 369: and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by
LINE 370: constantly heading them in the right direction we managed t'drive them
LINE 371: down t'the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who
LINE 372: had escaped death, but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.
LINE 373: However, I made signs t'them by nodding and frowning that they were to
LINE 374: hush their crying, and told them t'get all the sheep on board at once
LINE 375: and put out t'sea; s'they went aboard, took their places, and smote
LINE 376: the grey sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out as my
LINE 377: voice would reach, I began t'jeer at the Cyclops.
LINE 378: "'Cyclops,' said I, 'you should have taken better measure of your man
LINE 379: before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, eat up your
LINE 380: visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would
LINE 381: find you out, and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.'
LINE 382: "He got more and more furious as he heard me, s'he tore the top from
LINE 383: off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my ship s'that it
LINE 384: was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.81 The sea quaked
LINE 385: as the rock fell int'it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us
LINE 386: back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I
LINE 387: snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off, making signs t'my men
LINE 388: by nodding my head, that they must row for their lives, whereon they
LINE 389: laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before, I
LINE 390: was for jeering at the Cyclops again, but the men begged and prayed of
LINE 391: me t'hold my tongue.
LINE 392: "'D'not,' they exclaimed, 'be mad enough t'provoke this savage
LINE 393: creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us
LINE 394: back again t'the mainland, and we made sure it had been the death of
LINE 395: us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have
LINE 396: pounded our heads and our ship's timbers int'a jelly with the rugged
LINE 397: rocks he would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.'
LINE 398: "But I would not listen t'them, and shouted out t'him in my rage,
LINE 399: 'Cyclops, if any one asks you wh'it was that put your eye out and
LINE 400: spoiled your beauty, say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses, son of
LINE 401: Laertes, wh'lives in Ithaca.'
LINE 402: "On this he groaned, and cried out, 'Alas, alas, then the old prophecy
LINE 403: about me is coming true. There was a prophet here, at one time, a man
LINE 404: both brave and of great stature, Telemus son of Eurymus, wh'was an
LINE 405: excellent seer, and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he
LINE 406: grew old; he told me that all this would happen t'me some day, and
LINE 407: said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all
LINE 408: along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,
LINE 409: whereas he turns out t'be a little insignificant weakling, wh'has
LINE 410: managed t'blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come
LINE 411: here, then, Ulysses, that I may make you presents t'show my
LINE 412: hospitality, and urge Neptune t'help you forward on your journey—for
LINE 413: Neptune and I are father and son. He, if he s'will, shall heal me,
LINE 414: which n'one else neither god nor man can do.'
LINE 415: "Then I said, 'I wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and
LINE 416: sending you down t'the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more
LINE 417: than Neptune t'cure that eye of yours.'
LINE 418: "On this he lifted up his hands t'the firmament of heaven and prayed,
LINE 419: saying, 'Hear me, great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten
LINE 420: son, grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must
LINE 421: get back t'his friends at last, let him d's'late and in sore plight
LINE 422: after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man's ship
LINE 423: and find trouble in his house.'82
LINE 424: "Thus did he pray, and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a
LINE 425: rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and hurled it with
LINE 426: prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within a
LINE 427: little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock
LINE 428: fell int'it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on
LINE 429: our way towards the shore of the island.
LINE 430: "When at last we got t'the island where we had left the rest of our
LINE 431: ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously awaiting our
LINE 432: return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on t'the
LINE 433: sea shore; we als'landed the Cyclops' sheep, and divided them
LINE 434: equitably amongst us s'that none might have reason t'complain. As for
LINE 435: the ram, my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share;
LINE 436: s'I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and burned its thigh bones to
LINE 437: Jove, wh'is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice, and only
LINE 438: thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.
LINE 439: "Thus through the livelong day t'the going down of the sun we feasted
LINE 440: our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went down and it came on
LINE 441: dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered
LINE 442: Dawn appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they
LINE 443: took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; s'we sailed
LINE 444: on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad t'have escaped death though we
LINE 445: had lost our comrades.
