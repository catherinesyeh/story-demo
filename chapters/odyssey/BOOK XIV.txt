LINE 1: ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.
LINE 2: Ulysses now left the haven, and took the rough track up through the
LINE 3: wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the
LINE 4: place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd, wh'was
LINE 5: the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his
LINE 6: hut, which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be
LINE 7: seen from far. He had made them spacious126 and fair t'see, with a
LINE 8: free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his
LINE 9: master's absence, of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,
LINE 10: without saying anything t'Penelope or Laertes, and he had fenced them
LINE 11: on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of
LINE 12: oaken posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside he had
LINE 13: built twelve styes near one another for the sows t'lie in. There were
LINE 14: fifty pigs wallowing in each stye, all of them breeding sows; but the
LINE 15: boars slept outside and were much fewer in number, for the suitors kept
LINE 16: on eating them, and the swineherd had t'send them the best he had
LINE 17: continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs, and the
LINE 18: herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as wolves, slept always
LINE 19: with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of
LINE 20: sandals127 from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding
LINE 21: the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth t'town
LINE 22: with a boar that he had been forced t'send the suitors that they might
LINE 23: sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.
LINE 24: When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at
LINE 25: him, but Ulysses was cunning enough t'sit down and loose his hold of
LINE 26: the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have been torn by
LINE 27: them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,
LINE 28: rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off
LINE 29: by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said t'Ulysses, "Old
LINE 30: man, the dogs were likely t'have made short work of you, and then you
LINE 31: would have got me int'trouble. The gods have given me quite enough
LINE 32: worries without that, for I have lost the best of masters, and am in
LINE 33: continual grief on his account. I have t'attend swine for other people
LINE 34: t'eat, while he, if he yet lives t'see the light of day, is starving
LINE 35: in some distant land. But come inside, and when you have had your fill
LINE 36: of bread and wine, tell me where you come from, and all about your
LINE 37: misfortunes."
LINE 38: On this the swineherd led the way int'the hut and bade him sit down.
LINE 39: He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor, and on the top of
LINE 40: this he threw the shaggy chamois skin—a great thick one—on which he
LINE 41: used t'sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,
LINE 42: and said "May Jove, sir, and the rest of the gods grant you your
LINE 43: heart's desire in return for the kind way in which you have received
LINE 44: me."
LINE 45: T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Stranger, though a still
LINE 46: poorer man should come here, it would not be right for me t'insult
LINE 47: him, for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what
LINE 48: you can get and be thankful, for servants live in fear when they have
LINE 49: young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now, for
LINE 50: heaven has hindered the return of him wh'would have been always good
LINE 51: t'me and given me something of my own—a house, a piece of land, a good
LINE 52: looking wife, and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who
LINE 53: has worked hard for him, and whose labour the gods have prospered as
LINE 54: they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown
LINE 55: old here he would have done great things by me, but he is gone, and I
LINE 56: wish that Helen's whole race were utterly destroyed, for she has been
LINE 57: the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to
LINE 58: Ilius, the land of noble steeds, t'fight the Trojans in the cause of
LINE 59: king Agamemnon."
LINE 60: As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went t'the styes where
LINE 61: the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out tw'which he brought
LINE 62: back with him and sacrificed. He singed them, cut them up, and spitted
LINE 63: them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before
LINE 64: Ulysses, hot and still on the spit, whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over
LINE 65: with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of
LINE 66: ivy-wood, and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him t'begin.
LINE 67: "Fall to, stranger," said he, "on a dish of servant's pork. The fat
LINE 68: pigs have t'g't'the suitors, wh'eat them up without shame or
LINE 69: scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings, and
LINE 70: respect those wh'd'what is lawful and right. Even the fierce
LINE 71: freebooters wh'g'raiding on other people's land, and Jove gives them
LINE 72: their spoil—even they, when they have filled their ships and got home
LINE 73: again live conscience-stricken, and look fearfully for judgement; but
LINE 74: some god seems t'have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone;
LINE 75: they will not, therefore, g'back t'their own homes and make their
LINE 76: offers of marriage in the usual way, but waste his estate by force,
LINE 77: without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven, but they
LINE 78: sacrifice not one victim nor tw'only, and they take the run of his
LINE 79: wine, for he was exceedingly rich. N'other great man either in Ithaca
LINE 80: or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men
LINE 81: put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of
LINE 82: cattle upon the main land, and as many flocks of sheep, there are also
LINE 83: twelve droves of pigs, while his own men and hired strangers feed him
LINE 84: twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even
LINE 85: large flocks of goats on the far end of the island, and they are in the
LINE 86: charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the
LINE 87: best goat in the flock every day. As for myself, I am in charge of the
LINE 88: pigs that you see here, and I have t'keep picking out the best I have
LINE 89: and sending it t'them."
LINE 90: This was his story, but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously
LINE 91: without a word, brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was
LINE 92: satisfied, the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,
LINE 93: filled it with wine, and gave it t'Ulysses, wh'was pleased, and said
LINE 94: as he took it in his hands, "My friend, wh'was this master of yours
LINE 95: that bought you and paid for you, s'rich and s'powerful as you tell
LINE 96: me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me wh'he
LINE 97: was, in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods
LINE 98: know, but I may be able t'give you news of him, for I have travelled
LINE 99: much."
LINE 100: Eumaeus answered, "Old man, n'traveller wh'comes here with news will
LINE 101: get Ulysses' wife and son t'believe his story. Nevertheless, tramps in
LINE 102: want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies, and not a
LINE 103: word of truth; every one wh'finds his way t'Ithaca goes t'my
LINE 104: mistress and tells her falsehoods, whereon she takes them in, makes
LINE 105: much of them, and asks them all manner of questions, crying all the
LINE 106: time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too, old
LINE 107: man, for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty
LINE 108: story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to
LINE 109: pieces, or the fishes of the sea have eaten him, and his bones are
LINE 110: lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone,
LINE 111: and a bad business it is for all his friends—for me especially; go
LINE 112: where I may I shall never find s'good a master, not even if I were to
LINE 113: g'home t'my mother and father where I was bred and born. I d'not so
LINE 114: much care, however, about my parents now, though I should dearly like
LINE 115: t'see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that
LINE 116: grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is
LINE 117: here n'longer, for he was very fond of me, and took such care of me
LINE 118: that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory."
LINE 119: "My friend," replied Ulysses, "you are very positive, and very hard of
LINE 120: belief about your master's coming home again, nevertheless I will not
LINE 121: merely say, but will swear, that he is coming. D'not give me anything
LINE 122: for my news till he has actually come, you may then give me a shirt and
LINE 123: cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want, but I will not take
LINE 124: anything at all till then, for I hate a man, even as I hate hell fire,
LINE 125: wh'lets his poverty tempt him int'lying. I swear by king Jove, by the
LINE 126: rites of hospitality, and by that hearth of Ulysses t'which I have now
LINE 127: come, that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will
LINE 128: return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the
LINE 129: beginning of the next he will be here t'd'vengeance on all those who
LINE 130: are ill treating his wife and son."
LINE 131: T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Old man, you will neither
LINE 132: get paid for bringing good news, nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink
LINE 133: your wine in peace, and let us talk about something else. D'not keep
LINE 134: on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks
LINE 135: about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone, but I
LINE 136: only wish he may come, as d'Penelope, his old father Laertes, and his
LINE 137: son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy to'about this same boy of his;
LINE 138: he was running up fast int'manhood, and bade fare t'be n'worse man,
LINE 139: face and figure, than his father, but some one, either god or man, has
LINE 140: been unsettling his mind, s'he has gone off t'Pylos t'try and get
LINE 141: news of his father, and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is
LINE 142: coming home, in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a
LINE 143: name in Ithaca. But let us say n'more about him, and leave him t'be
LINE 144: taken, or else t'escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him
LINE 145: t'protect him. And now, old man, tell me your own story; tell me also,
LINE 146: for I want t'know, wh'you are and where you come from. Tell me of
LINE 147: your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how crew
LINE 148: brought you t'Ithaca, and from what country they professed t'come—for
LINE 149: you cannot have come by land."
LINE 150: And Ulysses answered, "I will tell you all about it. If there were meat
LINE 151: and wine enough, and we could stay here in the hut with nothing t'do
LINE 152: but t'eat and drink while the others g't'their work, I could easily
LINE 153: talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of
LINE 154: the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven t'visit me.
LINE 155: "I am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well t'd'man, wh'had many
LINE 156: sons born in marriage, whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had
LINE 157: purchased for a concubine; nevertheless, my father Castor son of Hylax
LINE 158: (whose lineage I claim, and wh'was held in the highest honour among
LINE 159: the Cretans for his wealth, prosperity, and the valour of his sons) put
LINE 160: me on the same level with my brothers wh'had been born in wedlock.
LINE 161: When, however, death took him t'the house of Hades, his sons divided
LINE 162: his estate and cast lots for their shares, but t'me they gave a
LINE 163: holding and little else; nevertheless, my valour enabled me t'marry
LINE 164: int'a rich family, for I was not given t'bragging, or shirking on the
LINE 165: field of battle. It is all over now; still, if you look at the straw
LINE 166: you can see what the ear was, for I have had trouble enough and to
LINE 167: spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my
LINE 168: men t'surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death s'much
LINE 169: as a thought, but was the first t'leap forward and spear all whom I
LINE 170: could overtake. Such was I in battle, but I did not care about farm
LINE 171: work, nor the frugal home life of those wh'would bring up children. My
LINE 172: delight was in ships, fighting, javelins, and arrows—things that most
LINE 173: men shudder t'think of; but one man likes one thing and another
LINE 174: another, and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the
LINE 175: Achaeans went t'Troy, nine times was I in command of men and ships on
LINE 176: foreign service, and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil
LINE 177: in the first instance, and much more was allotted t'me later on.
LINE 178: "My house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans, but
LINE 179: when Jove counselled that terrible expedition, in which s'many
LINE 180: perished, the people required me and Idomeneus t'lead their ships to
LINE 181: Troy, and there was n'way out of it, for they insisted on our doing
LINE 182: so. There we fought for nine whole years, but in the tenth we sacked
LINE 183: the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it
LINE 184: was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily
LINE 185: with my children, wife, and property, and then I conceived the idea of
LINE 186: making a descent on Egypt, s'I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.
LINE 187: I had nine ships, and the people flocked t'fill them. For six days I
LINE 188: and my men made feast, and I found them many victims both for sacrifice
LINE 189: t'the gods and for themselves, but on the seventh day we went on board
LINE 190: and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were
LINE 191: going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships, and we had
LINE 192: n'sickness on board, but sat where we were and let the ships g'as the
LINE 193: wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river
LINE 194: Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river, bidding my men stay
LINE 195: by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts t'reconnoitre
LINE 196: from every point of vantage.
LINE 197: "But the men disobeyed my orders, took t'their own devices, and
LINE 198: ravaged the land of the Egyptians, killing the men, and taking their
LINE 199: wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried t'the city, and
LINE 200: when they heard the war cry, the people came out at daybreak till the
LINE 201: plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of
LINE 202: armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men, and they would n'longer
LINE 203: face the enemy, for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians
LINE 204: killed many of us, and took the rest alive t'd'forced labour for
LINE 205: them. Jove, however, put it in my mind t'd'thus—and I wish I had died
LINE 206: then and there in Egypt instead, for there was much sorrow in store for
LINE 207: me—I took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand;
LINE 208: then I went straight up t'the king's chariot, clasped his knees and
LINE 209: kissed them, whereon he spared my life, bade me get int'his chariot,
LINE 210: and took me weeping t'his own home. Many made at me with their ashen
LINE 211: spears and tried t'kill me in their fury, but the king protected me,
LINE 212: for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers, who
LINE 213: punishes those wh'd'evil.
LINE 214: "I stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the
LINE 215: Egyptians, for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on
LINE 216: for eight years there came a certain Phoenician, a cunning rascal, who
LINE 217: had already committed all sorts of villainy, and this man talked me
LINE 218: over int'going with him t'Phoenicia, where his house and his
LINE 219: possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months, but at the
LINE 220: end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season
LINE 221: had come round again, he set me on board a ship bound for Libya, on a
LINE 222: pretence that I was t'take a carg'along with him t'that place, but
LINE 223: really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I
LINE 224: suspected his intention, but went on board with him, for I could not
LINE 225: help it.
LINE 226: "The ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea
LINE 227: that lies between Crete and Libya; there, however, Jove counselled
LINE 228: their destruction, for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could
LINE 229: see nothing but sea and sky, he raised a black cloud over our ship and
LINE 230: the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts
LINE 231: and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and
LINE 232: brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all int'the sea;
LINE 233: they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so
LINE 234: many sea-gulls, but the god presently deprived them of all chance of
LINE 235: getting home again. I was all dismayed. Jove, however, sent the ship's
LINE 236: mast within my reach, which saved my life, for I clung t'it, and
LINE 237: drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the
LINE 238: darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on t'the Thesprotian
LINE 239: coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably
LINE 240: without charging me anything at all—for his son found me when I was
LINE 241: nearly dead with cold and fatigue, whereon he raised me by the hand,
LINE 242: took me t'his father's house and gave me clothes t'wear.
LINE 243: "There it was that I heard news of Ulysses, for the king told me he had
LINE 244: entertained him, and shown him much hospitality while he was on his
LINE 245: homeward journey. He showed me als'the treasure of gold, and wrought
LINE 246: iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough t'keep his family
LINE 247: for ten generations, s'much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.
LINE 248: But the king said Ulysses had gone t'Dodona that he might learn Jove's
LINE 249: mind from the god's high oak tree, and know whether after s'long an
LINE 250: absence he should return t'Ithaca openly, or in secret. Moreover the
LINE 251: king swore in my presence, making drink-offerings in his own house as
LINE 252: he did so, that the ship was by the water side, and the crew found,
LINE 253: that should take him t'his own country. He sent me off however before
LINE 254: Ulysses returned, for there happened t'be a Thesprotian ship sailing
LINE 255: for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, and he told those in charge
LINE 256: of her t'be sure and take me safely t'King Acastus.
LINE 257: "These men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me t'the
LINE 258: very extreme of misery, for when the ship had got some way out from
LINE 259: land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the
LINE 260: shirt and cloak that I was wearing, and gave me instead the tattered
LINE 261: old clouts in which you now see me; then, towards nightfall, they
LINE 262: reached the tilled lands of Ithaca, and there they bound me with a
LINE 263: strong rope fast in the ship, while they went on shore t'get supper by
LINE 264: the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me, and having drawn
LINE 265: my rags over my head I slid down the rudder int'the sea, where I
LINE 266: struck out and swam till I was well clear of them, and came ashore near
LINE 267: a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my
LINE 268: having escaped and went searching about for me, till at last they
LINE 269: thought it was n'further use and went back t'their ship. The gods,
LINE 270: having hidden me thus easily, then took me t'a good man's door—for it
LINE 271: seems that I am not t'die yet awhile."
LINE 272: T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Poor unhappy stranger, I
LINE 273: have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting, but
LINE 274: that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to
LINE 275: believe it. Why should a man like you g'about telling lies in this
LINE 276: way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of
LINE 277: them detest him, or they would have taken him before Troy, or let him
LINE 278: die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;
LINE 279: for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his
LINE 280: son would have been heir t'his renown, but now the storm winds have
LINE 281: spirited him away we know not whither.
LINE 282: "As for me I live out of the way here with the pigs, and never g'to
LINE 283: the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news
LINE 284: about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions, both those
LINE 285: wh'grieve over the king's absence, and those wh'rejoice at it because
LINE 286: they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I
LINE 287: have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was
LINE 288: taken in by an Aetolian, wh'had killed a man and come a long way till
LINE 289: at last he reached my station, and I was very kind t'him. He said he
LINE 290: had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans, refitting his ships
LINE 291: which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the
LINE 292: following summer or autumn with his men, and that he would bring back
LINE 293: much wealth. And now you, you unfortunate old man, since fate has
LINE 294: brought you t'my door, d'not try t'flatter me in this way with vain
LINE 295: hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly, but
LINE 296: only out of respect for Jove the god of hospitality, as fearing him and
LINE 297: pitying you."
LINE 298: Ulysses answered, "I see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have
LINE 299: given you my oath, and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a
LINE 300: bargain, and call all the gods in heaven t'witness it. If your master
LINE 301: comes home, give me a cloak and shirt of good wear, and send me to
LINE 302: Dulichium where I want t'go; but if he does not come as I say he will,
LINE 303: set your men on t'me, and tell them t'throw me from yonder precipice,
LINE 304: as a warning t'tramps not t'g'about the country telling lies."
LINE 305: "And a pretty figure I should cut then," replied Eumaeus, "both now and
LINE 306: hereafter, if I were t'kill you after receiving you int'my hut and
LINE 307: showing you hospitality. I should have t'say my prayers in good
LINE 308: earnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will
LINE 309: come in directly, that we may cook something savoury for supper."
LINE 310: Thus did they converse, and presently the swineherds came up with the
LINE 311: pigs, which were then shut up for the night in their styes, and a
LINE 312: tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven int'them. But
LINE 313: Eumaeus called t'his men and said, "Bring in the best pig you have,
LINE 314: that I may sacrifice him for this stranger, and we will take toll of
LINE 315: him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs,
LINE 316: while others reap the fruit of our labour."
LINE 317: On this he began chopping firewood, while the others brought in a fine
LINE 318: fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not
LINE 319: forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, s'the first
LINE 320: thing he did was t'cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them
LINE 321: int'the fire, praying t'all the gods as he did s'that Ulysses might
LINE 322: return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which
LINE 323: he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood, and stunned it,
LINE 324: while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and
LINE 325: Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on t'some of the
LINE 326: fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers;
LINE 327: they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits
LINE 328: and roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the
LINE 329: spits they threw them on t'the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who
LINE 330: was a most equitable man, then stood up t'give every one his share. He
LINE 331: made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of
LINE 332: Maia and the nymphs, praying t'them as he did so; the others he dealt
LINE 333: out t'the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways
LINE 334: down the loin as a mark of especial honour, and Ulysses was much
LINE 335: pleased. "I hope, Eumaeus," said he, "that Jove will be as well
LINE 336: disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you are showing t'an
LINE 337: outcast like myself."
LINE 338: T'this you answered, 'swineherd Eumaeus, "Eat, my good fellow, and
LINE 339: enjoy your supper, such as it is. God grants this, and withholds that,
LINE 340: just as he thinks right, for he can d'whatever he chooses."
LINE 341: As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt
LINE 342: sacrifice t'the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering, put
LINE 343: the cup in the hands of Ulysses, and sat down t'his own portion.
LINE 344: Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man
LINE 345: on his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence,
LINE 346: and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either
LINE 347: t'his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good
LINE 348: things that were before them, and when they had had enough t'eat and
LINE 349: drink, Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread, and they all
LINE 350: went t'bed after having made a hearty supper.
LINE 351: Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for there was n'moon. It
LINE 352: poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the West, which
LINE 353: is a wet quarter, s'Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus, in
LINE 354: the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and
LINE 355: give it him, or make one of his men give him one. "Listen t'me," said
LINE 356: he, "Eumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell
LINE 357: you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will
LINE 358: make even a wise man fall t'singing; it will make him chuckle and
LINE 359: dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still, as
LINE 360: I have begun, I will g'on. Would that I were still young and strong as
LINE 361: when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the
LINE 362: leaders, but I was in command also, for the other tw'would have it so.
LINE 363: When we had come up t'the wall of the city we crouched down beneath
LINE 364: our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood
LINE 365: that grew about the swamp. It came on t'freeze with a North wind
LINE 366: blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields
LINE 367: were coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts,
LINE 368: and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders,
LINE 369: but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me, not thinking that I
LINE 370: should be to'cold, and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and
LINE 371: shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted
LINE 372: their places, I nudged Ulysses wh'was close t'me with my elbow, and
LINE 373: he at once gave me his ear.
LINE 374: "'Ulysses,' said I, 'this cold will be the death of me, for I have no
LINE 375: cloak; some god fooled me int'setting off with nothing on but my
LINE 376: shirt, and I d'not know what t'do.'
LINE 377: "Ulysses, wh'was as crafty as he was valiant, hit upon the following
LINE 378: plan:
LINE 379: "'Keep still,' said he in a low voice, 'or the others will hear you.'
LINE 380: Then he raised his head on his elbow.
LINE 381: "'My friends,' said he, 'I have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We
LINE 382: are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would g'down and tell
LINE 383: Agamemnon t'send us up more men at once.'
LINE 384: "On this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running
LINE 385: t'the ships, whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough
LINE 386: till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in
LINE 387: those days, for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak
LINE 388: both out of good will and for the respect due t'a brave soldier; but
LINE 389: now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby."
LINE 390: And Eumaeus answered, "Old man, you have told us an excellent story,
LINE 391: and have said nothing s'far but what is quite satisfactory; for the
LINE 392: present, therefore, you shall want neither clothing nor anything else
LINE 393: that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect, but to-morrow
LINE 394: morning you have t'shake your own old rags about your body again, for
LINE 395: we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here, but every man has
LINE 396: only one. When Ulysses' son comes home again he will give you both
LINE 397: cloak and shirt, and send you wherever you may want t'go."
LINE 398: With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some
LINE 399: goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here
LINE 400: Ulysses lay down, and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak
LINE 401: that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.
LINE 402: Thus did Ulysses sleep, and the young men slept beside him. But the
LINE 403: swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs, s'he got ready to
LINE 404: g'outside, and Ulysses was glad t'see that he looked after his
LINE 405: property during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his
LINE 406: brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak t'keep out the wind. He also
LINE 407: took the skin of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of
LINE 408: attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went t'his rest where the
LINE 409: pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from
LINE 410: the North wind.
