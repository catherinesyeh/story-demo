LINE 1: THE SIRENS, SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS, THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.
LINE 2: "After we were clear of the river Oceanus, and had got out int'the
LINE 3: open sea, we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is
LINE 4: dawn and sun-rise as in other places. We then drew our ship on t'the
LINE 5: sands and got out of her on t'the shore, where we went t'sleep and
LINE 6: waited till day should break.
LINE 7: "Then, when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I sent
LINE 8: some men t'Circe's house t'fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood
LINE 9: from a wood where the headland jutted out int'the sea, and after we
LINE 10: had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When
LINE 11: his body and armour had been burned t'ashes, we raised a cairn, set a
LINE 12: stone over it, and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had
LINE 13: been used t'row with.
LINE 14: "While we were doing all this, Circe, wh'knew that we had got back
LINE 15: from the house of Hades, dressed herself and came t'us as fast as she
LINE 16: could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread, meat, and
LINE 17: wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said, 'You have done a bold
LINE 18: thing in going down alive t'the house of Hades, and you will have died
LINE 19: twice, t'other people's once; now, then, stay here for the rest of the
LINE 20: day, feast your fill, and g'on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow
LINE 21: morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course, and
LINE 22: will explain everything t'him s'as t'prevent your suffering from
LINE 23: misadventure either by land or sea.'
LINE 24: "We agreed t'd'as she had said, and feasted through the livelong day
LINE 25: t'the going down of the sun, but when the sun had set and it came on
LINE 26: dark, the men laid themselves down t'sleep by the stern cables of the
LINE 27: ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from
LINE 28: the others, while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our
LINE 29: adventures.
LINE 30: "'S'far s'good,' said she, when I had ended my story, 'and now pay
LINE 31: attention t'what I am about t'tell you—heaven itself, indeed, will
LINE 32: recall it t'your recollection. First you will come t'the Sirens who
LINE 33: enchant all wh'come near them. If any one unwarily draws in to'close
LINE 34: and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never
LINE 35: welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to
LINE 36: death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead
LINE 37: men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them.
LINE 38: Therefore pass these Sirens by, and stop your men's ears with wax that
LINE 39: none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself, for you
LINE 40: may get the men t'bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half
LINE 41: way up the mast,99 and they must lash the rope's ends t'the mast
LINE 42: itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and
LINE 43: pray the men t'unloose you, then they must bind you faster.
LINE 44: "'When your crew have taken you past these Sirens, I cannot give you
LINE 45: coherent directions100 as t'which of tw'courses you are t'take; I
LINE 46: will lay the tw'alternatives before you, and you must consider them
LINE 47: for yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against
LINE 48: which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the
LINE 49: blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may
LINE 50: pass, no, not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia t'Father Jove,
LINE 51: but the sheer rock always carries off one of them, and Father Jove has
LINE 52: t'send another t'make up their number; n'ship that ever yet came to
LINE 53: these rocks has got away again, but the waves and whirlwinds of fire
LINE 54: are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only
LINE 55: vessel that ever sailed and got through, was the famous Arg'on her way
LINE 56: from the house of Aetes, and she to'would have gone against these
LINE 57: great rocks, only that Jun'piloted her past them for the love she bore
LINE 58: t'Jason.
LINE 59: "'Of these tw'rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a
LINE 60: dark cloud. This never leaves it, s'that the top is never clear not
LINE 61: even in summer and early autumn. N'man though he had twenty hands and
LINE 62: twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it, for it runs sheer
LINE 63: up, as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there
LINE 64: is a large cavern, looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must
LINE 65: take your ship this way, but the cave is s'high up that not even the
LINE 66: stoutest archer could send an arrow int'it. Inside it Scylla sits and
LINE 67: yelps with a voice that you might take t'be that of a young hound, but
LINE 68: in truth she is a dreadful monster and n'one—not even a god—could face
LINE 69: her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet, and
LINE 70: six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck
LINE 71: she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each, all set very
LINE 72: close together, s'that they would crunch any one t'death in a moment,
LINE 73: and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and
LINE 74: peering all round the rock, fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any
LINE 75: larger monster that she can catch, of the thousands with which
LINE 76: Amphitrite teems. N'ship ever yet got past her without losing some
LINE 77: men, for she shoots out all her heads at once, and carries off a man in
LINE 78: each mouth.
LINE 79: "'You will find the other rock lie lower, but they are s'close
LINE 80: together that there is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large
LINE 81: fig tree in full leaf101 grows upon it], and under it lies the sucking
LINE 82: whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her
LINE 83: waters, and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not
LINE 84: there when she is sucking, for if you are, Neptune himself could not
LINE 85: save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you
LINE 86: can, for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.'
LINE 87: "'Is there n'way,' said I, 'of escaping Charybdis, and at the same
LINE 88: time keeping Scylla off when she is trying t'harm my men?'
LINE 89: "'You dare devil,' replied the goddess, 'you are always wanting to
LINE 90: fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even
LINE 91: by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,
LINE 92: extreme, rude, cruel and invincible. There is n'help for it; your best
LINE 93: chance will be t'get by her as fast as ever you can, for if you dawdle
LINE 94: about her rock while you are putting on your armour, she may catch you
LINE 95: with a second cast of her six heads, and snap up another half dozen of
LINE 96: your men; s'drive your ship past her at full speed, and roar out
LINE 97: lustily t'Crataiis wh'is Scylla's dam, bad luck t'her; she will then
LINE 98: stop her from making a second raid upon you.'
LINE 99: "'You will now come t'the Thrinacian island, and here you will see
LINE 100: many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging t'the sun-god—seven
LINE 101: herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep, with fifty head in each
LINE 102: flock. They d'not breed, nor d'they become fewer in number, and they
LINE 103: are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie, wh'are children of
LINE 104: the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them
LINE 105: and had done suckling them sent them t'the Thrinacian island, which
LINE 106: was a long way off, t'live there and look after their father's flocks
LINE 107: and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed, and think of nothing but
LINE 108: getting home, you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you
LINE 109: harm them, then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and
LINE 110: of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape, you will
LINE 111: return late, in bad plight, after losing all your men.'
LINE 112: "Here she ended, and dawn enthroned in gold began t'show in heaven,
LINE 113: whereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to
LINE 114: loose the ship from her moorings; s'they at once got int'her, took
LINE 115: their places, and began t'smite the grey sea with their oars.
LINE 116: Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair
LINE 117: wind that blew dead aft, and staid steadily with us, keeping our sails
LINE 118: well filled, s'we did whatever wanted doing t'the ship's gear, and
LINE 119: let her g'as wind and helmsman headed her.
LINE 120: "Then, being much troubled in mind, I said t'my men, 'My friends, it
LINE 121: is not right that one or tw'of us alone should know the prophecies
LINE 122: that Circe has made me, I will therefore tell you about them, s'that
LINE 123: whether we live or die we may d's'with our eyes open. First she said
LINE 124: we were t'keep clear of the Sirens, wh'sit and sing most beautifully
LINE 125: in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself s'long as
LINE 126: n'one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me t'the crosspiece half
LINE 127: way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond s'fast that I
LINE 128: cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends t'the mast
LINE 129: itself. If I beg and pray you t'set me free, then bind me more tightly
LINE 130: still.'
LINE 131: "I had hardly finished telling everything t'the men before we reached
LINE 132: the island of the tw'Sirens,102 for the wind had been very favourable.
LINE 133: Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of wind
LINE 134: nor a ripple upon the water, s'the men furled the sails and stowed
LINE 135: them; then taking t'their oars they whitened the water with the foam
LINE 136: they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it
LINE 137: up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till
LINE 138: it became soft, which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of
LINE 139: the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men, and
LINE 140: they bound me hands and feet t'the mast as I stood upright on the
LINE 141: cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got within
LINE 142: earshot of the land, and the ship was going at a good rate, the Sirens
LINE 143: saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.
LINE 144: "'Come here,' they sang, 'renowned Ulysses, honour t'the Achaean name,
LINE 145: and listen t'our tw'voices. N'one ever sailed past us without
LINE 146: staying t'hear the enchanting sweetness of our song—and he wh'listens
LINE 147: will g'on his way not only charmed, but wiser, for we know all the
LINE 148: ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy, and
LINE 149: can tell you everything that is going t'happen over the whole world.'
LINE 150: "They sang these words most musically, and as I longed t'hear them
LINE 151: further I made signs by frowning t'my men that they should set me
LINE 152: free; but they quickened their stroke, and Eurylochus and Perimedes
LINE 153: bound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of
LINE 154: the Sirens' voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and
LINE 155: unbound me.
LINE 156: "Immediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from
LINE 157: which spray was rising, and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were
LINE 158: s'frightened that they loosed hold of their oars, for the whole sea
LINE 159: resounded with the rushing of the waters,103 but the ship stayed where
LINE 160: it was, for the men had left off rowing. I went round, therefore, and
LINE 161: exhorted them man by man not t'lose heart.
LINE 162: "'My friends,' said I, 'this is not the first time that we have been in
LINE 163: danger, and we are in nothing like s'bad a case as when the Cyclops
LINE 164: shut us up in his cave; nevertheless, my courage and wise counsel saved
LINE 165: us then, and we shall live t'look back on all this as well. Now,
LINE 166: therefore, let us all d'as I say, trust in Jove and row on with might
LINE 167: and main. As for you, coxswain, these are your orders; attend t'them,
LINE 168: for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming
LINE 169: rapids and hug the rock, or she will give you the slip and be over
LINE 170: yonder before you know where you are, and you will be the death of us.'
LINE 171: "S'they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster
LINE 172: Scylla, for I knew the men would not g'on rowing if I did, but would
LINE 173: huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe's
LINE 174: strict instructions—I put on my armour. Then seizing tw'strong spears
LINE 175: I took my stand on the ship's bows, for it was there that I expected
LINE 176: first t'see the monster of the rock, wh'was t'd'my men s'much
LINE 177: harm; but I could not make her out anywhere, though I strained my eyes
LINE 178: with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.
LINE 179: "Then we entered the Straits in great fear of mind, for on the one hand
LINE 180: was Scylla, and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt
LINE 181: water. As she vomited it up, it was like the water in a cauldron when
LINE 182: it is boiling over upon a great fire, and the spray reached the top of
LINE 183: the rocks on either side. When she began t'suck again, we could see
LINE 184: the water all inside whirling round and round, and it made a deafening
LINE 185: sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the
LINE 186: whirlpool all black with sand and mud, and the men were at their wits
LINE 187: ends for fear. While we were taken up with this, and were expecting
LINE 188: each moment t'be our last, Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and
LINE 189: snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and
LINE 190: men, and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever s'high above me,
LINE 191: struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off, and I heard them
LINE 192: call out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman, seated,
LINE 193: spear in hand, upon some jutting rock104 throws bait int'the water to
LINE 194: deceive the poor little fishes, and spears them with the ox's horn with
LINE 195: which his spear is shod, throwing them gasping on t'the land as he
LINE 196: catches them one by one—even s'did Scylla land these panting creatures
LINE 197: on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den, while they
LINE 198: screamed and stretched out their hands t'me in their mortal agony.
LINE 199: This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.
LINE 200: "When we had passed the [Wandering] rocks, with Scylla and terrible
LINE 201: Charybdis, we reached the noble island of the sun-god, where were the
LINE 202: goodly cattle and sheep belonging t'the sun Hyperion. While still at
LINE 203: sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home t'the
LINE 204: yards, and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban
LINE 205: prophet Teiresias had told me, and how carefully Aeaean Circe had
LINE 206: warned me t'shun the island of the blessed sun-god. S'being much
LINE 207: troubled I said t'the men, 'My men, I know you are hard pressed, but
LINE 208: listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me, and how
LINE 209: carefully Aeaean Circe warned me t'shun the island of the blessed
LINE 210: sun-god, for it was here, she said, that our worst danger would lie.
LINE 211: Head the ship, therefore, away from the island.'
LINE 212: "The men were in despair at this, and Eurylochus at once gave me an
LINE 213: insolent answer. 'Ulysses,' said he, 'you are cruel; you are very
LINE 214: strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem t'be made of iron,
LINE 215: and now, though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep, you
LINE 216: will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this
LINE 217: island, but bid them put out t'sea and g'faring fruitlessly on
LINE 218: through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds
LINE 219: blow hardest and d's'much damage; how can we escape should one of
LINE 220: those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West, which s'often
LINE 221: wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,
LINE 222: therefore, let us obey the behests of night and prepare our supper here
LINE 223: hard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will g'on board again and put
LINE 224: out t'sea.'
LINE 225: "Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. I saw that
LINE 226: heaven meant us a mischief and said, 'You force me t'yield, for you
LINE 227: are many against one, but at any rate each one of you must take his
LINE 228: solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of
LINE 229: sheep, he will not be s'mad as t'kill a single head of either, but
LINE 230: will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.'
LINE 231: "They all swore as I bade them, and when they had completed their oath
LINE 232: we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh
LINE 233: water, and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as
LINE 234: they had had enough t'eat and drink, they began talking about their
LINE 235: poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them
LINE 236: weeping and they went on crying till they fell off int'a sound sleep.
LINE 237: "In the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their
LINE 238: places, Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane s'that
LINE 239: land and sea were covered with thick clouds, and night sprang forth out
LINE 240: of the heavens. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,
LINE 241: appeared, we brought the ship t'land and drew her int'a cave wherein
LINE 242: the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances, and I called the men
LINE 243: together in council.
LINE 244: "'My friends,' said I, 'we have meat and drink in the ship, let us
LINE 245: mind, therefore, and not touch the cattle, or we shall suffer for it;
LINE 246: for these cattle and sheep belong t'the mighty sun, wh'sees and gives
LINE 247: ear t'everything.' And again they promised that they would obey.
LINE 248: "For a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South, and there was
LINE 249: n'other wind, but only South and East.105 As long as corn and wine
LINE 250: held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,
LINE 251: however, they had eaten all there was in the ship, they were forced to
LINE 252: g'further afield, with hook and line, catching birds, and taking
LINE 253: whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One
LINE 254: day, therefore, I went up inland that I might pray heaven t'show me
LINE 255: some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough t'be clear of
LINE 256: all my men, and had found a place that was well sheltered from the
LINE 257: wind, I washed my hands and prayed t'all the gods in Olympus till by
LINE 258: and by they sent me off int'a sweet sleep.
LINE 259: "Meanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel t'the men, 'Listen
LINE 260: t'me,' said he, 'my poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there
LINE 261: is none s'bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these
LINE 262: cows and offer them in sacrifice t'the immortal gods? If we ever get
LINE 263: back t'Ithaca, we can build a fine temple t'the sun-god and enrich it
LINE 264: with every kind of ornament; if, however, he is determined t'sink our
LINE 265: ship out of revenge for these horned cattle, and the other gods are of
LINE 266: the same mind, I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and
LINE 267: have done with it, than be starved t'death by inches in such a desert
LINE 268: island as this is.'
LINE 269: "Thus spoke Eurylochus, and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,
LINE 270: s'fair and goodly, were feeding not far from the ship; the men,
LINE 271: therefore, drove in the best of them, and they all stood round them
LINE 272: saying their prayers, and using young oak-shoots instead of
LINE 273: barley-meal, for there was n'barley left. When they had done praying
LINE 274: they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the
LINE 275: thigh bones, wrapped them round in tw'layers of fat, and set some
LINE 276: pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had n'wine with which t'make
LINE 277: drink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking, s'they kept
LINE 278: pouring on a little water from time t'time while the inward meats were
LINE 279: being grilled; then, when the thigh bones were burned and they had
LINE 280: tasted the inward meats, they cut the rest up small and put the pieces
LINE 281: upon the spits.
LINE 282: "By this time my deep sleep had left me, and I turned back t'the ship
LINE 283: and t'the sea shore. As I drew near I began t'smell hot roast meat,
LINE 284: s'I groaned out a prayer t'the immortal gods. 'Father Jove,' I
LINE 285: exclaimed, 'and all you other gods wh'live in everlasting bliss, you
LINE 286: have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep int'which you have sent me;
LINE 287: see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my absence.'
LINE 288: "Meanwhile Lampetie went straight off t'the sun and told him we had
LINE 289: been killing his cows, whereon he flew int'a great rage, and said to
LINE 290: the immortals, 'Father Jove, and all you other gods wh'live in
LINE 291: everlasting bliss, I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses' ship:
LINE 292: they have had the insolence t'kill my cows, which were the one thing I
LINE 293: loved t'look upon, whether I was going up heaven or down again. If
LINE 294: they d'not square accounts with me about my cows, I will g'down to
LINE 295: Hades and shine there among the dead.'
LINE 296: "'Sun,' said Jove, 'g'on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over
LINE 297: the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship int'little pieces with a
LINE 298: bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out t'sea.'
LINE 299: "I was told all this by Calypso, wh'said she had heard it from the
LINE 300: mouth of Mercury.
LINE 301: "As soon as I got down t'my ship and t'the sea shore I rebuked each
LINE 302: one of the men separately, but we could see n'way out of it, for the
LINE 303: cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once t'show signs
LINE 304: and wonders among us, for the hides of the cattle crawled about, and
LINE 305: the joints upon the spits began t'low like cows, and the meat, whether
LINE 306: cooked or raw, kept on making a noise just as cows do.
LINE 307: "For six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon
LINE 308: them, but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day, the fury
LINE 309: of the gale abated; we therefore went on board, raised our masts,
LINE 310: spread sail, and put out t'sea. As soon as we were well away from the
LINE 311: island, and could see nothing but sky and sea, the son of Saturn raised
LINE 312: a black cloud over our ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did
LINE 313: not get on much further, for in another moment we were caught by a
LINE 314: terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so
LINE 315: that it fell aft, while all the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom
LINE 316: of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the
LINE 317: ship's stern, s'that the bones of his head were crushed t'pieces, and
LINE 318: he fell overboard as though he were diving, with n'more life left in
LINE 319: him.
LINE 320: "Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts, and the ship went round and
LINE 321: round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck
LINE 322: it. The men all fell int'the sea; they were carried about in the water
LINE 323: round the ship, looking like s'many sea-gulls, but the god presently
LINE 324: deprived them of all chance of getting home again.
LINE 325: "I stuck t'the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel
LINE 326: (which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the
LINE 327: direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still
LINE 328: hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together,
LINE 329: and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to
LINE 330: take me.
LINE 331: "[The gale from the West had now spent its force, and the wind got into
LINE 332: the South again, which frightened me lest I should be taken back t'the
LINE 333: terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually
LINE 334: happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise
LINE 335: had reached the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking
LINE 336: down the salt sea water,106 but I was carried aloft toward the fig
LINE 337: tree, which I caught hold of and clung on t'like a bat. I could not
LINE 338: plant my feet anywhere s'as t'stand securely, for the roots were a
LINE 339: long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too
LINE 340: high, to'vast, and to'far apart for me t'reach them; s'I hung
LINE 341: patiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft
LINE 342: again—and a very long while it seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to
