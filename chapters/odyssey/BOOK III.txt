LINE 1: TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.
LINE 2: but as the sun was rising from the fair sea24 int'the firmament of
LINE 3: heaven t'shed light on mortals and immortals, they reached Pylos the
LINE 4: city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore
LINE 5: t'offer sacrifice of black bulls t'Neptune lord of the Earthquake.
LINE 6: There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each, and there were
LINE 7: nine bulls t'each guild. As they were eating the inward meats25 and
LINE 8: burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,
LINE 9: Telemachus and his crew arrived, furled their sails, brought their ship
LINE 10: t'anchor, and went ashore.
LINE 11: Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,
LINE 12: "Telemachus, you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have
LINE 13: taken this voyage t'try and find out where your father is buried and
LINE 14: how he came by his end; s'g'straight up t'Nestor that we may see
LINE 15: what he has got t'tell us. Beg of him t'speak the truth, and he will
LINE 16: tell n'lies, for he is an excellent person."
LINE 17: "But how, Mentor," replied Telemachus, "dare I g'up t'Nestor, and how
LINE 18: am I t'address him? I have never yet been used t'holding long
LINE 19: conversations with people, and am ashamed t'begin questioning one who
LINE 20: is s'much older than myself."
LINE 21: "Some things, Telemachus," answered Minerva, "will be suggested t'you
LINE 22: by your own instinct, and heaven will prompt you further; for I am
LINE 23: assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth
LINE 24: until now."
LINE 25: She then went quickly on, and Telemachus followed in her steps till
LINE 26: they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were
LINE 27: assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons, while his
LINE 28: company round him were busy getting dinner ready, and putting pieces of
LINE 29: meat on t'the spits26 while other pieces were cooking. When they saw
LINE 30: the strangers they crowded round them, took them by the hand and bade
LINE 31: them take their places. Nestor's son Pisistratus at once offered his
LINE 32: hand t'each of them, and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were
LINE 33: lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he
LINE 34: gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them
LINE 35: int'a golden cup, handing it t'Minerva first, and saluting her at the
LINE 36: same time.
LINE 37: "Offer a prayer, sir," said he, "t'King Neptune, for it is his feast
LINE 38: that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink
LINE 39: offering, pass the cup t'your friend that he may d's'also. I doubt
LINE 40: not that he to'lifts his hands in prayer, for man cannot live without
LINE 41: God in the world. Still he is younger than you are, and is much of an
LINE 42: age with myself, s'I will give you the precedence."
LINE 43: As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and
LINE 44: proper of him t'have given it t'herself first;27 she accordingly
LINE 45: began praying heartily t'Neptune. "'thou," she cried, "that
LINE 46: encirclest the earth, vouchsafe t'grant the prayers of thy servants
LINE 47: that call upon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace
LINE 48: on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter als'make the rest of the Pylian
LINE 49: people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering
LINE 50: you. Lastly, grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue, in respect of
LINE 51: the matter that has brought us in our ship t'Pylos."
LINE 52: When she had thus made an end of praying, she handed the cup to
LINE 53: Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by, when the outer meats were
LINE 54: roasted and had been taken off the spits, the carvers gave every man
LINE 55: his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had
LINE 56: had enough t'eat and drink, Nestor, knight of Gerene, began t'speak.
LINE 57: "Now," said he, "that our guests have done their dinner, it will be
LINE 58: best t'ask them wh'they are. Who, then, sir strangers, are you, and
LINE 59: from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or d'you sail the
LINE 60: seas as rovers with your hand against every man, and every man's hand
LINE 61: against you?"
LINE 62: Telemachus answered boldly, for Minerva had given him courage t'ask
LINE 63: about his father and get himself a good name.
LINE 64: "Nestor," said he, "son of Neleus, honour t'the Achaean name, you ask
LINE 65: whence we come, and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under
LINE 66: Neritum,28 and the matter about which I would speak is of private not
LINE 67: public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses, wh'is said to
LINE 68: have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what
LINE 69: fate befell each one of the other heroes wh'fought at Troy, but as
LINE 70: regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is
LINE 71: dead at all, for n'one can certify us in what place he perished, nor
LINE 72: say whether he fell in battle on the mainland, or was lost at sea amid
LINE 73: the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees, if
LINE 74: haply you may be pleased t'tell me of his melancholy end, whether you
LINE 75: saw it with your own eyes, or heard it from some other traveller, for
LINE 76: he was a man born t'trouble. D'not soften things out of any pity for
LINE 77: me, but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave
LINE 78: father Ulysses ever did you loyal service, either by word or deed, when
LINE 79: you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans, bear it in mind now as in
LINE 80: my favour and tell me truly all."
LINE 81: "My friend," answered Nestor, "you recall a time of much sorrow t'my
LINE 82: mind, for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea, while
LINE 83: privateering under Achilles, and when fighting before the great city of
LINE 84: king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there—Ajax, Achilles,
LINE 85: Patroclus peer of gods in counsel, and my own dear son Antilochus, a
LINE 86: man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much
LINE 87: more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?
LINE 88: Though you were t'stay here and question me for five years, or even
LINE 89: six, I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered, and you would
LINE 90: turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we
LINE 91: try every kind of stratagem, but the hand of heaven was against us;
LINE 92: during all this time there was n'one wh'could compare with your
LINE 93: father in subtlety—if indeed you are his son—I can hardly believe my
LINE 94: eyes—and you talk just like him too—n'one would say that people of
LINE 95: such different ages could speak s'much alike. He and I never had any
LINE 96: kind of difference from first t'last neither in camp nor council, but
LINE 97: in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might
LINE 98: be ordered for the best.
LINE 99: "When, however, we had sacked the city of Priam, and were setting sail
LINE 100: in our ships as heaven had dispersed us, then Jove saw fit t'vex the
LINE 101: Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise
LINE 102: or understanding, and hence many came t'a bad end through the
LINE 103: displeasure of Jove's daughter Minerva, wh'brought about a quarrel
LINE 104: between the tw'sons of Atreus.
LINE 105: "The sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be, for
LINE 106: it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they
LINE 107: explained why they had called the people together, it seemed that
LINE 108: Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once, and this displeased
LINE 109: Agamemnon, wh'thought that we should wait till we had offered
LINE 110: hecatombs t'appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was, he might
LINE 111: have known that he would not prevail with her, for when the gods have
LINE 112: made up their minds they d'not change them lightly. S'the tw'stood
LINE 113: bandying hard words, whereon the Achaeans sprang t'their feet with a
LINE 114: cry that rent the air, and were of tw'minds as t'what they should do.
LINE 115: "That night we rested and nursed our anger, for Jove was hatching
LINE 116: mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into
LINE 117: the water and put our goods with our women on board, while the rest,
LINE 118: about half in number, stayed behind with Agamemnon. We—the other
LINE 119: half—embarked and sailed; and the ships went well, for heaven had
LINE 120: smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices t'the
LINE 121: gods, for we were longing t'get home; cruel Jove, however, did not yet
LINE 122: mean that we should d'so, and raised a second quarrel in the course of
LINE 123: which some among us turned their ships back again, and sailed away
LINE 124: under Ulysses t'make their peace with Agamemnon; but I, and all the
LINE 125: ships that were with me pressed forward, for I saw that mischief was
LINE 126: brewing. The son of Tydeus went on als'with me, and his crews with
LINE 127: him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos, and found us making up our
LINE 128: minds about our course—for we did not know whether t'g'outside Chios
LINE 129: by the island of Psyra, keeping this t'our left, or inside Chios, over
LINE 130: against the stormy headland of Mimas. S'we asked heaven for a sign,
LINE 131: and were shown one t'the effect that we should be soonest out of
LINE 132: danger if we headed our ships across the open sea t'Euboea. This we
LINE 133: therefore did, and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage
LINE 134: during the night t'Geraestus,29 where we offered many sacrifices to
LINE 135: Neptune for having helped us s'far on our way. Four days later Diomed
LINE 136: and his men stationed their ships in Argos, but I held on for Pylos,
LINE 137: and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it
LINE 138: fair for me.
LINE 139: "Therefore, my dear young friend, I returned without hearing anything
LINE 140: about the others. I know neither wh'got home safely nor wh'were lost
LINE 141: but, as in duty bound, I will give you without reserve the reports that
LINE 142: have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the
LINE 143: Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles' son Neoptolemus; s'also
LINE 144: did the valiant son of Poias, Philoctetes. Idomeneus, again, lost no
LINE 145: men at sea, and all his followers wh'escaped death in the field got
LINE 146: safe home with him t'Crete. N'matter how far out of the world you
LINE 147: live, you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came t'at
LINE 148: the hands of Aegisthus—and a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently
LINE 149: pay. See what a good thing it is for a man t'leave a son behind him to
LINE 150: d'as Orestes did, wh'killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble
LINE 151: father. You too, then—for you are a tall smart-looking fellow—show your
LINE 152: mettle and make yourself a name in story."
LINE 153: "Nestor son of Neleus," answered Telemachus, "honour t'the Achaean
LINE 154: name, the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all
LINE 155: time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant
LINE 156: me t'd'like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors, wh'are
LINE 157: ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have n'such
LINE 158: happiness in store for me and for my father, s'we must bear it as best
LINE 159: we may."
LINE 160: "My friend," said Nestor, "now that you remind me, I remember t'have
LINE 161: heard that your mother has many suitors, wh'are ill disposed towards
LINE 162: you and are making havoc of your estate. D'you submit t'this tamely,
LINE 163: or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Wh'knows
LINE 164: but what Ulysses may come back after all, and pay these scoundrels in
LINE 165: full, either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If
LINE 166: Minerva were t'take as great a liking t'you as she did t'Ulysses
LINE 167: when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so
LINE 168: openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father), if she
LINE 169: would take as good care of you as she did of him, these wooers would
LINE 170: soon some of them forget their wooing."
LINE 171: Telemachus answered, "I can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far
LINE 172: to'much t'hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though
LINE 173: the gods themselves willed it n'such good fortune could befall me."
LINE 174: On this Minerva said, "Telemachus, what are you talking about? Heaven
LINE 175: has a long arm if it is minded t'save a man; and if it were me, I
LINE 176: should not care how much I suffered before getting home, provided I
LINE 177: could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this, than get home
LINE 178: quickly, and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the
LINE 179: treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still, death is certain, and when
LINE 180: a man's hour is come, not even the gods can save him, n'matter how
LINE 181: fond they are of him."
LINE 182: "Mentor," answered Telemachus, "d'not let us talk about it any more.
LINE 183: There is n'chance of my father's ever coming back; the gods have long
LINE 184: since counselled his destruction. There is something else, however,
LINE 185: about which I should like t'ask Nestor, for he knows much more than
LINE 186: any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so
LINE 187: that it is like talking t'an immortal. Tell me, therefore, Nestor, and
LINE 188: tell me true; how did Agamemnon come t'die in that way? What was
LINE 189: Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus t'kill s'far better a
LINE 190: man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos, voyaging
LINE 191: elsewhither among mankind, that Aegisthus took heart and killed
LINE 192: Agamemnon?"
LINE 193: "I will tell you truly," answered Nestor, "and indeed you have yourself
LINE 194: divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had
LINE 195: found Aegisthus still alive in his house, there would have been no
LINE 196: barrow heaped up for him, not even when he was dead, but he would have
LINE 197: been thrown outside the city t'dogs and vultures, and not a woman
LINE 198: would have mourned him, for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but
LINE 199: we were over there, fighting hard at Troy, and Aegisthus, wh'was
LINE 200: taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos, cajoled Agamemnon's wife
LINE 201: Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.
LINE 202: "At first she would have nothing t'd'with his wicked scheme, for she
LINE 203: was of a good natural disposition;30 moreover there was a bard with
LINE 204: her, t'whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,
LINE 205: that he was t'keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled
LINE 206: her destruction, Aegisthus carried this bard off t'a desert island and
LINE 207: left him there for crows and seagulls t'batten upon—after which she
LINE 208: went willingly enough t'the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many
LINE 209: burnt sacrifices t'the gods, and decorated many temples with
LINE 210: tapestries and gilding, for he had succeeded far beyond his
LINE 211: expectations.
LINE 212: "Meanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy, on good terms
LINE 213: with one another. When we got t'Sunium, which is the point of Athens,
LINE 214: Apoll'with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of
LINE 215: Menelaus' ship (and never man knew better how t'handle a vessel in
LINE 216: rough weather) s'that he died then and there with the helm in his
LINE 217: hand, and Menelaus, though very anxious t'press forward, had t'wait
LINE 218: in order t'bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.
LINE 219: Presently, when he to'could put t'sea again, and had sailed on as far
LINE 220: as the Malean heads, Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow
LINE 221: hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and
LINE 222: took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about
LINE 223: the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts
LINE 224: stretching out int'the sea from a place called Gortyn, and all along
LINE 225: this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there
LINE 226: is a south wind blowing, but after Phaestus the coast is more
LINE 227: protected, for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this
LINE 228: part of the fleet was driven on t'the rocks and wrecked; but the crews
LINE 229: just managed t'save themselves. As for the other five ships, they were
LINE 230: taken by winds and seas t'Egypt, where Menelaus gathered much gold and
LINE 231: substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at
LINE 232: home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed
LINE 233: Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene, and the people were obedient under him,
LINE 234: but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens t'be his bane,
LINE 235: and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral
LINE 236: rites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet t'the people
LINE 237: of Argos, and on that very day Menelaus came home,31 with as much
LINE 238: treasure as his ships could carry.
LINE 239: "Take my advice then, and d'not g'travelling about for long s'far
LINE 240: from home, nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your
LINE 241: house; they will eat up everything you have among them, and you will
LINE 242: have been on a fool's errand. Still, I should advise you by all means
LINE 243: t'g'and visit Menelaus, wh'has lately come off a voyage among such
LINE 244: distant peoples as n'man could ever hope t'get back from, when the
LINE 245: winds had once carried him s'far out of his reckoning; even birds
LINE 246: cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month, s'vast and terrible are the
LINE 247: seas that they must cross. G't'him, therefore, by sea, and take your
LINE 248: own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a
LINE 249: chariot, you can have horses, and here are my sons wh'can escort you
LINE 250: t'Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him t'speak the truth, and
LINE 251: he will tell you n'lies, for he is an excellent person."
LINE 252: As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark, whereon Minerva said,
LINE 253: "Sir, all that you have said is well; now, however, order the tongues
LINE 254: of the victims t'be cut, and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings
LINE 255: t'Neptune, and the other immortals, and then g't'bed, for it is bed
LINE 256: time. People should g'away early and not keep late hours at a
LINE 257: religious festival."
LINE 258: Thus spoke the daughter of Jove, and they obeyed her saying. Men
LINE 259: servants poured water over the hands of the guests, while pages filled
LINE 260: the mixing-bowls with wine and water, and handed it round after giving
LINE 261: every man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the
LINE 262: victims int'the fire, and stood up t'make their drink offerings. When
LINE 263: they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was
LINE 264: minded, Minerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship, but
LINE 265: Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.
LINE 266: "Heaven and the immortal gods," he exclaimed, "forbid that you should
LINE 267: leave my house t'g'on board of a ship. D'you think I am s'poor and
LINE 268: short of clothes, or that I have s'few cloaks and as t'be unable to
LINE 269: find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell
LINE 270: you I have store both of rugs and cloaks, and shall not permit the son
LINE 271: of my old friend Ulysses t'camp down on the deck of a ship—not while I
LINE 272: live—nor yet will my sons after me, but they will keep open house as I
LINE 273: have done."
LINE 274: Then Minerva answered, "Sir, you have spoken well, and it will be much
LINE 275: better that Telemachus should d'as you have said; he, therefore, shall
LINE 276: return with you and sleep at your house, but I must g'back t'give
LINE 277: orders t'my crew, and keep them in good heart. I am the only older
LINE 278: person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus' own age,
LINE 279: wh'have taken this voyage out of friendship; s'I must return t'the
LINE 280: ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must g't'the Cauconians
LINE 281: where I have a large sum of money long owing t'me. As for Telemachus,
LINE 282: now that he is your guest, send him t'Lacedaemon in a chariot, and let
LINE 283: one of your sons g'with him. Be pleased t'als'provide him with your
LINE 284: best and fleetest horses."
LINE 285: When she had thus spoken, she flew away in the form of an eagle, and
LINE 286: all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished, and took
LINE 287: Telemachus by the hand. "My friend," said he, "I see that you are going
LINE 288: t'be a great her'some day, since the gods wait upon you thus while
LINE 289: you are still s'young. This can have been none other of those who
LINE 290: dwell in heaven than Jove's redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, who
LINE 291: shewed such favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy
LINE 292: queen," he continued, "vouchsafe t'send down thy grace upon myself, my
LINE 293: good wife, and my children. In return, I will offer you in sacrifice a
LINE 294: broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by
LINE 295: man under the yoke. I will gild her horns, and will offer her up t'you
LINE 296: in sacrifice."
LINE 297: Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to
LINE 298: his own house, followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got
LINE 299: there and had taken their places on the benches and seats, he mixed
LINE 300: them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the
LINE 301: housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the
LINE 302: wine, he prayed much and made drink offerings t'Minerva, daughter of
LINE 303: Aegis-bearing Jove. Then, when they had made their drink offerings and
LINE 304: had drunk each as much as he was minded, the others went home t'bed
LINE 305: each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus t'sleep in the room
LINE 306: that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus, wh'was the only
LINE 307: unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room
LINE 308: of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.
LINE 309: Now when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Nestor left
LINE 310: his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble
LINE 311: that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus, peer of
LINE 312: gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone t'the house of
LINE 313: Hades; s'Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand, as guardian of the
LINE 314: public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,
LINE 315: Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Aretus, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son
LINE 316: was Pisistratus, and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with
LINE 317: them. Nestor then addressed them.
LINE 318: "My sons," said he, "make haste t'd'as I shall bid you. I wish first
LINE 319: and foremost t'propitiate the great goddess Minerva, wh'manifested
LINE 320: herself visibly t'me during yesterday's festivities. Go, then, one or
LINE 321: other of you t'the plain, tell the stockman t'look me out a heifer,
LINE 322: and come on here with it at once. Another must g't'Telemachus' ship,
LINE 323: and invite all the crew, leaving tw'men only in charge of the vessel.
LINE 324: Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith t'gild the
LINE 325: horns of the heifer. The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the
LINE 326: maids in the house t'prepare an excellent dinner, and t'fetch seats,
LINE 327: and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them als't'bring me some
LINE 328: clear spring water."
LINE 329: On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was
LINE 330: brought in from the plain, and Telemachus's crew came from the ship;
LINE 331: the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which he
LINE 332: worked his gold, and Minerva herself came t'accept the sacrifice.
LINE 333: Nestor gave out the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer
LINE 334: that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and
LINE 335: Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the
LINE 336: house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it, and in his other hand
LINE 337: he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a
LINE 338: sharp axe, ready t'strike the heifer, while Perseus held a bucket.
LINE 339: Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley
LINE 340: meal, and he offered many a prayer t'Minerva as he threw a lock from
LINE 341: the heifer's head upon the fire.
LINE 342: When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal32 Thrasymedes
LINE 343: dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut
LINE 344: through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the daughters and
LINE 345: daughters in law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was
LINE 346: eldest daughter t'Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted
LINE 347: the heifer's head from off the ground, and Pisistratus cut her throat.
LINE 348: When she had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They
LINE 349: cut out the thigh bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two
LINE 350: layers of fat, and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then
LINE 351: Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them, while
LINE 352: the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.
LINE 353: When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats, they
LINE 354: cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the spits and
LINE 355: toasted them over the fire.
LINE 356: Meanwhile lovely Polycaste, Nestor's youngest daughter, washed
LINE 357: Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil, she
LINE 358: brought him a fair mantle and shirt,33 and he looked like a god as he
LINE 359: came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the
LINE 360: outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to
LINE 361: dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen, wh'kept

LINE 368: Telemachus got int'the chariot, while Pisistratus gathered up the
LINE 369: reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they
LINE 370: flew forward nothing loth int'the open country, leaving the high
LINE 371: citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel, swaying the
LINE 372: yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all
LINE 373: the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived, wh'was son to
LINE 374: Ortilochus and grandson t'Alpheus. Here they passed the night and
LINE 375: Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning,
LINE 376: rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, they again yoked their horses and drove
LINE 377: out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse.34 Pisistratus
LINE 378: lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they
