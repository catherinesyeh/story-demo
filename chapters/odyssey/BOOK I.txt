LINE 1: Tell me, 'Muse, of that ingenious her'wh'travelled far and wide
LINE 2: after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,
LINE 3: and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was
LINE 4: acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying t'save his
LINE 5: own life and bring his men safely home; but d'what he might he could
LINE 6: not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in
LINE 7: eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; s'the god prevented them
LINE 8: from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh
LINE 9: daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.
LINE 10: S'now all wh'escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely
LINE 11: home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing t'return t'his
LINE 12: wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, wh'had got him
LINE 13: int'a large cave and wanted t'marry him. But as years went by, there
LINE 14: came a time when the gods settled that he should g'back t'Ithaca;
LINE 15: even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were
LINE 16: not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun t'pity him
LINE 17: except Neptune, wh'still persecuted him without ceasing and would not
LINE 18: let him get home.
LINE 19: Now Neptune had gone off t'the Ethiopians, wh'are at the world's end,
LINE 20: and lie in tw'halves, the one looking West and the other East.1 He had
LINE 21: gone there t'accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen, and was enjoying
LINE 22: himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of
LINE 23: Olympian Jove, and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment
LINE 24: he was thinking of Aegisthus, wh'had been killed by Agamemnon's son
LINE 25: Orestes; s'he said t'the other gods:
LINE 26: "See now, how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing
LINE 27: but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to
LINE 28: Agamemnon's wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon, though he knew
LINE 29: it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury t'warn him not t'do
LINE 30: either of these things, inasmuch as Orestes would be sure t'take his
LINE 31: revenge when he grew up and wanted t'return home. Mercury told him
LINE 32: this in all good will but he would not listen, and now he has paid for
LINE 33: everything in full."
LINE 34: Then Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, it served
LINE 35: Aegisthus right, and s'it would any one else wh'does as he did; but
LINE 36: Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart
LINE 37: bleeds, when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,
LINE 38: far away, poor man, from all his friends. It is an island covered with
LINE 39: forest, in the very middle of the sea, and a goddess lives there,
LINE 40: daughter of the magician Atlas, wh'looks after the bottom of the
LINE 41: ocean, and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth
LINE 42: asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,
LINE 43: and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment t'make him forget his
LINE 44: home, s'that he is tired of life, and thinks of nothing but how he may
LINE 45: once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You, sir, take n'heed of
LINE 46: this, and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you
LINE 47: with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being s'angry
LINE 48: with him?"
LINE 49: And Jove said, "My child, what are you talking about? How can I forget
LINE 50: Ulysses than whom there is n'more capable man on earth, nor more
LINE 51: liberal in his offerings t'the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear
LINE 52: in mind, however, that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having
LINE 53: blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to
LINE 54: Neptune by the nymph Thoosa, daughter t'the sea-king Phorcys;
LINE 55: therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright, he torments him by
LINE 56: preventing him from getting home. Still, let us lay our heads together
LINE 57: and see how we can help him t'return; Neptune will then be pacified,
LINE 58: for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us."
LINE 59: And Minerva said, "Father, son of Saturn, King of kings, if, then, the
LINE 60: gods now mean that Ulysses should get home, we should first send
LINE 61: Mercury t'the Ogygian island t'tell Calyps'that we have made up our
LINE 62: minds and that he is t'return. In the meantime I will g't'Ithaca, to
LINE 63: put heart int'Ulysses' son Telemachus; I will embolden him t'call the
LINE 64: Achaeans in assembly, and speak out t'the suitors of his mother
LINE 65: Penelope, wh'persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I
LINE 66: will als'conduct him t'Sparta and t'Pylos, t'see if he can hear
LINE 67: anything about the return of his dear father—for this will make people
LINE 68: speak well of him."
LINE 69: S'saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals, imperishable,
LINE 70: with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the
LINE 71: redoubtable bronze-shod spear, s'stout and sturdy and strong,
LINE 72: wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes wh'have displeased her, and
LINE 73: down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus, whereon forthwith
LINE 74: she was in Ithaca, at the gateway of Ulysses' house, disguised as a
LINE 75: visitor, Mentes, chief of the Taphians, and she held a bronze spear in
LINE 76: her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the
LINE 77: oxen which they had killed and eaten, and playing draughts in front of
LINE 78: the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about t'wait upon
LINE 79: them, some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls, some cleaning
LINE 80: down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again, and some
LINE 81: cutting up great quantities of meat.
LINE 82: Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily
LINE 83: among the suitors thinking about his brave father, and how he would
LINE 84: send them flying out of the house, if he were t'come t'his own again
LINE 85: and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them,
LINE 86: he caught sight of Minerva and went straight t'the gate, for he was
LINE 87: vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took
LINE 88: her right hand in his own, and bade her give him her spear. "Welcome,"
LINE 89: said he, "t'our house, and when you have partaken of food you shall
LINE 90: tell us what you have come for."
LINE 91: He led the way as he spoke, and Minerva followed him. When they were
LINE 92: within he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong
LINE 93: bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father,
LINE 94: and he conducted her t'a richly decorated seat under which he threw a
LINE 95: cloth of damask. There was a footstool als'for her feet,2 and he set
LINE 96: another seat near her for himself, away from the suitors, that she
LINE 97: might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence, and
LINE 98: that he might ask her more freely about his father.
LINE 99: A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and
LINE 100: poured it int'a silver basin for them t'wash their hands, and she
LINE 101: drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread,
LINE 102: and offered them many good things of what there was in the house, the
LINE 103: carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold
LINE 104: by their side, and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for
LINE 105: them.
LINE 106: Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and
LINE 107: seats.3 Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands, maids
LINE 108: went round with the bread-baskets, pages filled the mixing-bowls with
LINE 109: wine and water, and they laid their hands upon the good things that
LINE 110: were before them. As soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink they
LINE 111: wanted music and dancing, which are the crowning embellishments of a
LINE 112: banquet, s'a servant brought a lyre t'Phemius, whom they compelled
LINE 113: perforce t'sing t'them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to
LINE 114: sing Telemachus spoke low t'Minerva, with his head close t'hers that
LINE 115: n'man might hear.
LINE 116: "I hope, sir," said he, "that you will not be offended with what I am
LINE 117: going t'say. Singing comes cheap t'those wh'd'not pay for it, and
LINE 118: all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some
LINE 119: wilderness or grinding t'powder in the surf. If these men were t'see
LINE 120: my father come back t'Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather
LINE 121: than a longer purse, for money would not serve them; but he, alas, has
LINE 122: fallen on an ill fate, and even when people d'sometimes say that he is
LINE 123: coming, we n'longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,
LINE 124: sir, tell me and tell me true, wh'you are and where you come from.
LINE 125: Tell me of your town and parents, what manner of ship you came in, how
LINE 126: your crew brought you t'Ithaca, and of what nation they declared
LINE 127: themselves t'be—for you cannot have come by land. Tell me als'truly,
LINE 128: for I want t'know, are you a stranger t'this house, or have you been
LINE 129: here in my father's time? In the old days we had many visitors for my
LINE 130: father went about much himself."
LINE 131: And Minerva answered, "I will tell you truly and particularly all about
LINE 132: it. I am Mentes, son of Anchialus, and I am King of the Taphians. I
LINE 133: have come here with my ship and crew, on a voyage t'men of a foreign
LINE 134: tongue being bound for Temesa4 with a carg'of iron, and I shall bring
LINE 135: back copper. As for my ship, it lies over yonder off the open country
LINE 136: away from the town, in the harbour Rheithron5 under the wooded mountain
LINE 137: Neritum.6 Our fathers were friends before us, as old Laertes will tell
LINE 138: you, if you will g'and ask him. They say, however, that he never comes
LINE 139: t'town now, and lives by himself in the country, faring hardly, with
LINE 140: an old woman t'look after him and get his dinner for him, when he
LINE 141: comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your
LINE 142: father was at home again, and that was why I came, but it seems the
LINE 143: gods are still keeping him back, for he is not dead yet not on the
LINE 144: mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean,
LINE 145: or a prisoner among savages wh'are detaining him against his will. I
LINE 146: am n'prophet, and know very little about omens, but I speak as it is
LINE 147: borne in upon me from heaven, and assure you that he will not be away
LINE 148: much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were
LINE 149: in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But
LINE 150: tell me, and tell me true, can Ulysses really have such a fine looking
LINE 151: fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head
LINE 152: and eyes, for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where
LINE 153: the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never
LINE 154: either of us seen the other."
LINE 155: "My mother," answered Telemachus, "tells me I am son t'Ulysses, but it
LINE 156: is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son t'one
LINE 157: wh'had grown old upon his own estates, for, since you ask me, there is
LINE 158: n'more ill-starred man under heaven than he wh'they tell me is my
LINE 159: father."
LINE 160: And Minerva said, "There is n'fear of your race dying out yet, while
LINE 161: Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me, and tell me true,
LINE 162: what is the meaning of all this feasting, and wh'are these people?
LINE 163: What is it all about? Have you some banquet, or is there a wedding in
LINE 164: the family—for n'one seems t'be bringing any provisions of his own?
LINE 165: And the guests—how atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make
LINE 166: over the whole house; it is enough t'disgust any respectable person
LINE 167: wh'comes near them."
LINE 168: "Sir," said Telemachus, "as regards your question, s'long as my father
LINE 169: was here it was well with us and with the house, but the gods in their
LINE 170: displeasure have willed it otherwise, and have hidden him away more
LINE 171: closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it
LINE 172: better even though he were dead, if he had fallen with his men before
LINE 173: Troy, or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting
LINE 174: were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his
LINE 175: ashes, and I should myself have been heir t'his renown; but now the
LINE 176: storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone
LINE 177: without leaving s'much as a trace behind him, and I inherit nothing
LINE 178: but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of
LINE 179: my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the
LINE 180: chiefs from all our islands, Dulichium, Same, and the woodland island
LINE 181: of Zacynthus, as als'all the principal men of Ithaca itself, are
LINE 182: eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court t'my
LINE 183: mother, wh'will neither point blank say that she will not marry,7 nor
LINE 184: yet bring matters t'an end; s'they are making havoc of my estate, and
LINE 185: before long will d's'als'with myself."
LINE 186: "Is that so?" exclaimed Minerva, "then you d'indeed want Ulysses home
LINE 187: again. Give him his helmet, shield, and a couple of lances, and if he
LINE 188: is the man he was when I first knew him in our house, drinking and
LINE 189: making merry, he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,
LINE 190: were he t'stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming
LINE 191: from Ephyra, where he had been t'beg poison for his arrows from Ilus,
LINE 192: son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give
LINE 193: him any, but my father let him have some, for he was very fond of him.
LINE 194: If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short
LINE 195: shrift and a sorry wedding.
LINE 196: "But there! It rests with heaven t'determine whether he is t'return,
LINE 197: and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would, however, urge you
LINE 198: t'set about trying t'get rid of these suitors at once. Take my
LINE 199: advice, call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning—lay your
LINE 200: case before them, and call heaven t'bear you witness. Bid the suitors
LINE 201: take themselves off, each t'his own place, and if your mother's mind
LINE 202: is set on marrying again, let her g'back t'her father, wh'will find
LINE 203: her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that s'dear
LINE 204: a daughter may expect. As for yourself, let me prevail upon you t'take
LINE 205: the best ship you can get, with a crew of twenty men, and g'in quest
LINE 206: of your father wh'has s'long been missing. Some one may tell you
LINE 207: something, or (and people often hear things in this way) some
LINE 208: heaven-sent message may direct you. First g't'Pylos and ask Nestor;
LINE 209: thence g'on t'Sparta and visit Menelaus, for he got home last of all
LINE 210: the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way
LINE 211: home, you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet
LINE 212: another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death, come
LINE 213: home at once, celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp, build a
LINE 214: barrow t'his memory, and make your mother marry again. Then, having
LINE 215: done all this, think it well over in your mind how, by fair means or
LINE 216: foul, you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are to'old to
LINE 217: plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing
LINE 218: Orestes' praises for having killed his father's murderer Aegisthus? You
LINE 219: are a fine, smart looking fellow; show your mettle, then, and make
LINE 220: yourself a name in story. Now, however, I must g'back t'my ship and
LINE 221: t'my crew, wh'will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think
LINE 222: the matter over for yourself, and remember what I have said t'you."
LINE 223: "Sir," answered Telemachus, "it has been very kind of you t'talk t'me
LINE 224: in this way, as though I were your own son, and I will d'all you tell
LINE 225: me; I know you want t'be getting on with your voyage, but stay a
LINE 226: little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will
LINE 227: then give you a present, and you shall g'on your way rejoicing; I will
LINE 228: give you one of great beauty and value—a keepsake such as only dear
LINE 229: friends give t'one another."
LINE 230: Minerva answered, "D'not try t'keep me, for I would be on my way at
LINE 231: once. As for any present you may be disposed t'make me, keep it till I
LINE 232: come again, and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very
LINE 233: good one, and I will give you one of n'less value in return."
LINE 234: With these words she flew away like a bird int'the air, but she had
LINE 235: given Telemachus courage, and had made him think more than ever about
LINE 236: his father. He felt the change, wondered at it, and knew that the
LINE 237: stranger had been a god, s'he went straight t'where the suitors were
LINE 238: sitting.
LINE 239: Phemius was still singing, and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he
LINE 240: told the sad tale of the return from Troy, and the ills Minerva had
LINE 241: laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope, daughter of Icarius, heard his song
LINE 242: from her room upstairs, and came down by the great staircase, not
LINE 243: alone, but attended by tw'of her handmaids. When she reached the
LINE 244: suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof
LINE 245: of the cloisters8 with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a
LINE 246: veil, moreover, before her face, and was weeping bitterly.
LINE 247: "Phemius," she cried, "you know many another feat of gods and heroes,
LINE 248: such as poets love t'celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,
LINE 249: and let them drink their wine in silence, but cease this sad tale, for
LINE 250: it breaks my sorrowful heart, and reminds me of my lost husband whom I
LINE 251: mourn ever without ceasing, and whose name was great over all Hellas
LINE 252: and middle Argos."9
LINE 253: "Mother," answered Telemachus, "let the bard sing what he has a mind
LINE 254: to; bards d'not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove, not they, who
LINE 255: makes them, and wh'sends weal or woe upon mankind according t'his own
LINE 256: good pleasure. This fellow means n'harm by singing the ill-fated
LINE 257: return of the Danaans, for people always applaud the latest songs most
LINE 258: warmly. Make up your mind t'it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only
LINE 259: man wh'never came back from Troy, but many another went down as well
LINE 260: as he. Go, then, within the house and busy yourself with your daily
LINE 261: duties, your loom, your distaff, and the ordering of your servants; for
LINE 262: speech is man's matter, and mine above all others 10—for it is I wh'am
LINE 263: master here."
LINE 264: She went wondering back int'the house, and laid her son's saying in
LINE 265: her heart. Then, going upstairs with her handmaids int'her room, she
LINE 266: mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.
LINE 267: But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters11, and
LINE 268: prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.
LINE 269: Then Telemachus spoke, "Shameless," he cried, "and insolent suitors,
LINE 270: let us feast at our pleasure now, and let there be n'brawling, for it
LINE 271: is a rare thing t'hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;
LINE 272: but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal
LINE 273: notice t'depart, and feast at one another's houses, turn and turn
LINE 274: about, at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose t'persist in
LINE 275: spunging upon one man, heaven help me, but Jove shall reckon with you
LINE 276: in full, and when you fall in my father's house there shall be n'man
LINE 277: t'avenge you."
LINE 278: The suitors bit their lips as they heard him, and marvelled at the
LINE 279: boldness of his speech. Then, Antinous, son of Eupeithes, said, "The
LINE 280: gods seem t'have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may
LINE 281: Jove never grant you t'be chief in Ithaca as your father was before
LINE 282: you."
LINE 283: Telemachus answered, "Antinous, d'not chide with me, but, god willing,
LINE 284: I will be chief to'if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of
LINE 285: for me? It is n'bad thing t'be a chief, for it brings both riches and
LINE 286: honour. Still, now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in
LINE 287: Ithaca both old and young, and some other may take the lead among them;
LINE 288: nevertheless I will be chief in my own house, and will rule those whom
LINE 289: Ulysses has won for me."
LINE 290: Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered, "It rests with heaven to
LINE 291: decide wh'shall be chief among us, but you shall be master in your own
LINE 292: house and over your own possessions; n'one while there is a man in
LINE 293: Ithaca shall d'you violence nor rob you. And now, my good fellow, I
LINE 294: want t'know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of
LINE 295: what family is he, and where is his estate? Has he brought you news
LINE 296: about the return of your father, or was he on business of his own? He
LINE 297: seemed a well t'd'man, but he hurried off s'suddenly that he was
LINE 298: gone in a moment before we could get t'know him."
LINE 299: "My father is dead and gone," answered Telemachus, "and even if some
LINE 300: rumour reaches me I put n'more faith in it now. My mother does indeed
LINE 301: sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him, but I give his
LINE 302: prophecyings n'heed. As for the stranger, he was Mentes, son of
LINE 303: Anchialus, chief of the Taphians, an old friend of my father's." But in
LINE 304: his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.
LINE 305: The suitors then returned t'their singing and dancing until the
LINE 306: evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to
LINE 307: bed each in his own abode.12 Telemachus's room was high up in a tower13
LINE 308: that looked on t'the outer court; hither, then, he hied, brooding and
LINE 309: full of thought. A good old woman, Euryclea, daughter of Ops, the son
LINE 310: of Pisenor, went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes
LINE 311: had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the
LINE 312: worth of twenty oxen for her, and shewed as much respect t'her in his
LINE 313: household as he did t'his own wedded wife, but he did not take her to
LINE 314: his bed for he feared his wife's resentment.14 She it was wh'now
LINE 315: lighted Telemachus t'his room, and she loved him better than any of
LINE 316: the other women in the house did, for she had nursed him when he was a
LINE 317: baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as
LINE 318: he took off his shirt15 he gave it t'the good old woman, wh'folded it
LINE 319: tidily up, and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side, after which
LINE 320: she went out, pulled the door t'by a silver catch, and drew the bolt
LINE 321: home by means of the strap.16 But Telemachus as he lay covered with a
LINE 322: woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage
LINE 323: and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.
