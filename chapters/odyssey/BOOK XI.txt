LINE 1: THE VISIT T'THE DEAD.88
LINE 2: "Then, when we had got down t'the sea shore we drew our ship int'the
LINE 3: water and got her mast and sails int'her; we als'put the sheep on
LINE 4: board and took our places, weeping and in great distress of mind.
LINE 5: Circe, that great and cunning goddess, sent us a fair wind that blew
LINE 6: dead aft and staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well
LINE 7: filled; s'we did whatever wanted doing t'the ship's gear and let her
LINE 8: g'as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were
LINE 9: full as she held her course over the sea, but when the sun went down
LINE 10: and darkness was over all the earth, we got int'the deep waters of the
LINE 11: river Oceanus, where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians wh'live
LINE 12: enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce
LINE 13: neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens, but
LINE 14: the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there
LINE 15: we beached the ship, took the sheep out of her, and went along by the
LINE 16: waters of Oceanus till we came t'the place of which Circe had told us.
LINE 17: "Here Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword
LINE 18: and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering t'all the
LINE 19: dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with
LINE 20: water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying
LINE 21: earnestly t'the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I
LINE 22: got back t'Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best
LINE 23: I had, and would load the pyre with good things. I als'particularly
LINE 24: promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep t'himself, the best
LINE 25: in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently t'the dead, I cut the
LINE 26: throats of the tw'sheep and let the blood run int'the trench, whereon
LINE 27: the ghosts came trooping up from Erebusâ€”brides,89 young bachelors, old
LINE 28: men worn out with toil, maids wh'had been crossed in love, and brave
LINE 29: men wh'had been killed in battle, with their armour still smirched
LINE 30: with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench
LINE 31: with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with
LINE 32: fear. When I saw them coming I told the men t'be quick and flay the
LINE 33: carcasses of the tw'dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and
LINE 34: at the same time t'repeat prayers t'Hades and t'Proserpine; but I
LINE 35: sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless
LINE 36: ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my
LINE 37: questions.
LINE 38: "The first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor, for he had
LINE 39: not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and
LINE 40: unburied in Circe's house, for we had had to'much else t'do. I was
LINE 41: very sorry for him, and cried when I saw him: 'Elpenor,' said I, 'how
LINE 42: did you come down here int'this gloom and darkness? You have got here
LINE 43: on foot quicker than I have with my ship.'
LINE 44: "'Sir,' he answered with a groan, 'it was all bad luck, and my own
LINE 45: unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe's
LINE 46: house, and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase
LINE 47: but fell right off the roof and broke my neck, s'my soul came down to
LINE 48: the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have
LINE 49: left behind you, though they are not here, by your wife, by the father
LINE 50: wh'brought you up when you were a child, and by Telemachus wh'is the
LINE 51: one hope of your house, d'what I shall now ask you. I know that when
LINE 52: you leave this limb'you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean
LINE 53: island. D'not g'thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you, or
LINE 54: I may bring heaven's anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I
LINE 55: have, build a barrow for me on the sea shore, that may tell people in
LINE 56: days t'come what a poor unlucky fellow I was, and plant over my grave
LINE 57: the oar I used t'row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.'
LINE 58: And I said, 'My poor fellow, I will d'all that you have asked of me.'
LINE 59: "Thus, then, did we sit and hold sad talk with one another, I on the
LINE 60: one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood, and the ghost
LINE 61: of my comrade saying all this t'me from the other side. Then came the
LINE 62: ghost of my dead mother Anticlea, daughter t'Autolycus. I had left her
LINE 63: alive when I set out for Troy and was moved t'tears when I saw her,
LINE 64: but even so, for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood
LINE 65: till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.
LINE 66: "Then came als'the ghost of Theban Teiresias, with his golden sceptre
LINE 67: in his hand. He knew me and said, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why,
LINE 68: poor man, have you left the light of day and come down t'visit the
LINE 69: dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your
LINE 70: sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.'
LINE 71: "S'I drew back, and sheathed my sword, whereon when he had drank of
LINE 72: the blood he began with his prophecy.
LINE 73: "'You want t'know,' said he, 'about your return home, but heaven will
LINE 74: make this hard for you. I d'not think that you will escape the eye of
LINE 75: Neptune, wh'still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having
LINE 76: blinded his son. Still, after much suffering you may get home if you
LINE 77: can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the
LINE 78: Thrinacian island, where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging
LINE 79: t'the sun, wh'sees and gives ear t'everything. If you leave these
LINE 80: flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home, you may yet
LINE 81: after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them, then I forewarn
LINE 82: you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men. Even though
LINE 83: you may yourself escape, you will return in bad plight after losing all
LINE 84: your men, [in another man's ship, and you will find trouble in your
LINE 85: house, which will be overrun by high-handed people, wh'are devouring
LINE 86: your substance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to
LINE 87: your wife.
LINE 88: "'When you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and
LINE 89: after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house, you
LINE 90: must take a well made oar and carry it on and on, till you come t'a
LINE 91: country where the people have never heard of the sea and d'not even
LINE 92: mix salt with their food, nor d'they know anything about ships, and
LINE 93: oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain
LINE 94: token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and
LINE 95: will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your
LINE 96: shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a
LINE 97: ram, a bull, and a boar t'Neptune.90 Then g'home and offer hecatombs
LINE 98: t'all the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself, death
LINE 99: shall come t'you from the sea, and your life shall ebb away very
LINE 100: gently when you are full of years and peace of mind, and your people
LINE 101: shall bless you. All that I have said will come true].'91
LINE 102: "'This,' I answered, 'must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and
LINE 103: tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother's ghost close by us; she
LINE 104: is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own
LINE 105: son she does not remember me and speak t'me; tell me, Sir, how I can
LINE 106: make her know me.'
LINE 107: "'That,' said he, 'I can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the
LINE 108: blood will talk with you like a reasonable being, but if you d'not let
LINE 109: them have any blood they will g'away again.'
LINE 110: "On this the ghost of Teiresias went back t'the house of Hades, for
LINE 111: his prophecyings had now been spoken, but I sat still where I was until
LINE 112: my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and
LINE 113: spoke fondly t'me, saying, 'My son, how did you come down t'this
LINE 114: abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the
LINE 115: living t'see these places, for between us and them there are great and
LINE 116: terrible waters, and there is Oceanus, which n'man can cross on foot,
LINE 117: but he must have a good ship t'take him. Are you all this time trying
LINE 118: t'find your way home from Troy, and have you never yet got back to
LINE 119: Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?'
LINE 120: "'Mother,' said I, 'I was forced t'come here t'consult the ghost of
LINE 121: the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean
LINE 122: land nor set foot on my native country, and I have had nothing but one
LINE 123: long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with
LINE 124: Agamemnon for Ilius, the land of noble steeds, t'fight the Trojans.
LINE 125: But tell me, and tell me true, in what way did you die? Did you have a
LINE 126: long illness, or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to
LINE 127: eternity? Tell me als'about my father, and the son whom I left behind
LINE 128: me, is my property still in their hands, or has some one else got hold
LINE 129: of it, wh'thinks that I shall not return t'claim it? Tell me again
LINE 130: what my wife intends doing, and in what mind she is; does she live with
LINE 131: my son and guard my estate securely, or has she made the best match she
LINE 132: could and married again?'
LINE 133: "My mother answered, 'Your wife still remains in your house, but she is
LINE 134: in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night
LINE 135: and day. N'one as yet has got possession of your fine property, and
LINE 136: Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has t'entertain
LINE 137: largely, as of course he must, considering his position as a
LINE 138: magistrate,92 and how every one invites him; your father remains at his
LINE 139: old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no
LINE 140: comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in
LINE 141: front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags, but in
LINE 142: summer, when the warm weather comes on again, he lies out in the
LINE 143: vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown any how upon the ground. He
LINE 144: grieves continually about your never having come home, and suffers more
LINE 145: and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise:
LINE 146: heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house, nor was
LINE 147: I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out
LINE 148: and kill them, but my longing t'know what you were doing and the force
LINE 149: of my affection for youâ€”this it was that was the death of me.'93
LINE 150: "Then I tried t'find some way of embracing my poor mother's ghost.
LINE 151: Thrice I sprang towards her and tried t'clasp her in my arms, but each
LINE 152: time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom, and
LINE 153: being touched t'the quick I said t'her, 'Mother, why d'you not stay
LINE 154: still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one
LINE 155: another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in
LINE 156: the house of Hades; does Proserpine want t'lay a still further load of
LINE 157: grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?'
LINE 158: "'My son,' she answered, 'most ill-fated of all mankind, it is not
LINE 159: Proserpine that is beguiling you, but all people are like this when
LINE 160: they are dead. The sinews n'longer hold the flesh and bones together;
LINE 161: these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has
LINE 162: left the body, and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,
LINE 163: however, g'back t'the light of day as soon as you can, and note all
LINE 164: these things that you may tell them t'your wife hereafter.'
LINE 165: "Thus did we converse, and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the
LINE 166: wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds
LINE 167: about the blood, and I considered how I might question them severally.
LINE 168: In the end I deemed that it would be best t'draw the keen blade that
LINE 169: hung by my sturdy thigh, and keep them from all drinking the blood at
LINE 170: once. S'they came up one after the other, and each one as I questioned
LINE 171: her told me her race and lineage.
LINE 172: "The first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of
LINE 173: Cretheus the son of Aeolus.94 She fell in love with the river Enipeus
LINE 174: wh'is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she
LINE 175: was taking a walk by his side as usual, Neptune, disguised as her
LINE 176: lover, lay with her at the mouth of the river, and a huge blue wave
LINE 177: arched itself like a mountain over them t'hide both woman and god,
LINE 178: whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.
LINE 179: When the god had accomplished the deed of love, he took her hand in his
LINE 180: own and said, 'Tyro, rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods
LINE 181: are not fruitless, and you will have fine twins about this time twelve
LINE 182: months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune, s'now g'home, but hold
LINE 183: your tongue and d'not tell any one.'
LINE 184: "Then he dived under the sea, and she in due course bore Pelias and
LINE 185: Neleus, wh'both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a
LINE 186: great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus, but the other lived in
LINE 187: Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus, namely, Aeson,
LINE 188: Pheres, and Amythaon, wh'was a mighty warrior and charioteer.
LINE 189: "Next t'her I saw Antiope, daughter t'Asopus, wh'could boast of
LINE 190: having slept in the arms of even Jove himself, and wh'bore him two
LINE 191: sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates, and
LINE 192: built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not
LINE 193: hold Thebes till they had walled it.
LINE 194: "Then I saw Alcmena, the wife of Amphitryon, wh'als'bore t'Jove
LINE 195: indomitable Hercules; and Megara wh'was daughter t'great King Creon,
LINE 196: and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.
LINE 197: "I als'saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it
LINE 198: was t'marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after
LINE 199: having killed his father, but the gods proclaimed the whole story to
LINE 200: the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes, in great grief for the
LINE 201: spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went t'the house of the
LINE 202: mighty jailor Hades, having hanged herself for grief, and the avenging
LINE 203: spirits haunted him as for an outraged motherâ€”t'his ruing bitterly
LINE 204: thereafter.
LINE 205: "Then I saw Chloris, whom Neleus married for her beauty, having given
LINE 206: priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter t'Amphion son of
LINE 207: Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus, and was Queen in Pylos. She bore
LINE 208: Nestor, Chromius, and Periclymenus, and she als'bore that marvellously
LINE 209: lovely woman Pero, wh'was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus
LINE 210: would only give her t'him wh'should raid the cattle of Iphicles from
LINE 211: the grazing grounds of Phylace, and this was a hard task. The only man
LINE 212: wh'would undertake t'raid them was a certain excellent seer,95 but
LINE 213: the will of heaven was against him, for the rangers of the cattle
LINE 214: caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had
LINE 215: passed and the same season came round again, Iphicles set him at
LINE 216: liberty, after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus, then,
LINE 217: was the will of Jove accomplished.
LINE 218: "And I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus, wh'bore him tw'famous sons,
LINE 219: Castor breaker of horses, and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these
LINE 220: heroes are lying under the earth, though they are still alive, for by a
LINE 221: special dispensation of Jove, they die and come t'life again, each one
LINE 222: of them every other day throughout all time, and they have the rank of
LINE 223: gods.
LINE 224: "After her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus wh'boasted the embrace of
LINE 225: Neptune. She bore tw'sons Otus and Ephialtes, but both were short
LINE 226: lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,
LINE 227: and the best looking, Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they
LINE 228: were nine fathoms high, and measured nine cubits round the chest. They
LINE 229: threatened t'make war with the gods in Olympus, and tried t'set Mount
LINE 230: Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus, and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,
LINE 231: that they might scale heaven itself, and they would have done it to'if
LINE 232: they had been grown up, but Apollo, son of Leto, killed both of them,
LINE 233: before they had got s'much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or
LINE 234: chin.
LINE 235: "Then I saw Phaedra, and Procris, and fair Ariadne daughter of the
LINE 236: magician Minos, whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete t'Athens, but
LINE 237: he did not enjoy her, for before he could d's'Diana killed her in the
LINE 238: island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.
LINE 239: "I als'saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle, wh'sold her own
LINE 240: husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were t'name
LINE 241: every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw, and
LINE 242: it is time for me t'g't'bed, either on board ship with my crew, or
LINE 243: here. As for my escort, heaven and yourselves will see t'it."
LINE 244: Here he ended, and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless
LINE 245: throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said t'them:â€”
LINE 246: "What d'you think of this man, 'Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good
LINE 247: looking, and is he not clever? True, he is my own guest, but all of you
LINE 248: share in the distinction. D'not be in a hurry t'send him away, nor
LINE 249: niggardly in the presents you make t'one wh'is in such great need,
LINE 250: for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance."
LINE 251: Then spoke the aged her'Echeneus wh'was one of the oldest men among
LINE 252: them, "My friends," said he, "what our august queen has just said t'us
LINE 253: is both reasonable and t'the purpose, therefore be persuaded by it;
LINE 254: but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King
LINE 255: Alcinous."
LINE 256: "The thing shall be done," exclaimed Alcinous, "as surely as I still
LINE 257: live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to
LINE 258: get home, still we must persuade him t'remain with us until to-morrow,
LINE 259: by which time I shall be able t'get together the whole sum that I mean
LINE 260: t'give him. As regards his escort it will be a matter for you all, and
LINE 261: mine above all others as the chief person among you."
LINE 262: And Ulysses answered, "King Alcinous, if you were t'bid me t'stay
LINE 263: here for a whole twelve months, and then speed me on my way, loaded
LINE 264: with your noble gifts, I should obey you gladly and it would redound
LINE 265: greatly t'my advantage, for I should return fuller-handed t'my own
LINE 266: people, and should thus be more respected and beloved by all wh'see me
LINE 267: when I get back t'Ithaca."
LINE 268: "Ulysses," replied Alcinous, "not one of us wh'sees you has any idea
LINE 269: that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people
LINE 270: going about wh'tell such plausible stories that it is very hard t'see
LINE 271: through them, but there is a style about your language which assures me
LINE 272: of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own
LINE 273: misfortunes, and those of the Argives, as though you were a practiced
LINE 274: bard; but tell me, and tell me true, whether you saw any of the mighty
LINE 275: heroes wh'went t'Troy at the same time with yourself, and perished
LINE 276: there. The evenings are still at their longest, and it is not yet bed
LINE 277: timeâ€”g'on, therefore, with your divine story, for I could stay here
LINE 278: listening till tomorrow morning, s'long as you will continue t'tell
LINE 279: us of your adventures."
LINE 280: "Alcinous," answered Ulysses, "there is a time for making speeches, and
LINE 281: a time for going t'bed; nevertheless, since you s'desire, I will not
LINE 282: refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades
LINE 283: wh'did not fall fighting with the Trojans, but perished on their
LINE 284: return, through the treachery of a wicked woman.
LINE 285: "When Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions, the
LINE 286: ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up t'me, surrounded by
LINE 287: those wh'had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as
LINE 288: he had tasted the blood, he knew me, and weeping bitterly stretched out
LINE 289: his arms towards me t'embrace me; but he had n'strength nor substance
LINE 290: any more, and I to'wept and pitied him as I beheld him. 'How did you
LINE 291: come by your death,' said I, 'King Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his
LINE 292: winds and waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies
LINE 293: make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or
LINE 294: sheep-stealing, or while they were fighting in defence of their wives
LINE 295: and city?'
LINE 296: "'Ulysses,' he answered, 'noble son of Laertes, I was not lost at sea
LINE 297: in any storm of Neptune's raising, nor did my foes despatch me upon the
LINE 298: mainland, but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between
LINE 299: them. He asked me t'his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most
LINE 300: miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all
LINE 301: around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding
LINE 302: breakfast, or picnic, or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You
LINE 303: must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement, or
LINE 304: in single combat, but you never saw anything s'truly pitiable as the
LINE 305: way in which we fell in that cloister, with the mixing bowl and the
LINE 306: loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with our blood. I
LINE 307: heard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her
LINE 308: close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body,
LINE 309: and raised my hands t'kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped
LINE 310: away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was
LINE 311: dying, for there is nothing in this world s'cruel and s'shameless as
LINE 312: a woman when she has fallen int'such guilt as hers was. Fancy
LINE 313: murdering her own husband! I thought I was going t'be welcomed home by
LINE 314: my children and my servants, but her abominable crime has brought
LINE 315: disgrace on herself and all women wh'shall come afterâ€”even on the good
LINE 316: ones.'
LINE 317: "And I said, 'In truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to
LINE 318: last in the matter of their women's counsels. See how many of us fell
LINE 319: for Helen's sake, and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief
LINE 320: against you to'during your absence.'
LINE 321: "'Be sure, therefore,' continued Agamemnon, 'and not be to'friendly
LINE 322: even with your own wife. D'not tell her all that you know perfectly
LINE 323: well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel about
LINE 324: the rest. Not that your wife, Ulysses, is likely t'murder you, for
LINE 325: Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We
LINE 326: left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for
LINE 327: Troy. This child n'doubt is now grown up happily t'man's estate,96
LINE 328: and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one
LINE 329: another as it is right they should do, whereas my wicked wife did not
LINE 330: even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son, but killed me ere I
LINE 331: could d'so. Furthermore I sayâ€”and lay my saying t'your heartâ€”d'not
LINE 332: tell people when you are bringing your ship t'Ithaca, but steal a
LINE 333: march upon them, for after all this there is n'trusting women. But now
LINE 334: tell me, and tell me true, can you give me any news of my son Orestes?
LINE 335: Is he in Orchomenus, or at Pylos, or is he at Sparta with Menelausâ€”for
LINE 336: I presume that he is still living.'
LINE 337: "And I said, 'Agamemnon, why d'you ask me? I d'not know whether your
LINE 338: son is alive or dead, and it is not right t'talk when one does not
LINE 339: know.'
LINE 340: "As we tw'sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the
LINE 341: ghost of Achilles came up t'us with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax
LINE 342: wh'was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son
LINE 343: of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,
LINE 344: saying, 'Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, what deed of daring will you
LINE 345: undertake next, that you venture down t'the house of Hades among us
LINE 346: silly dead, wh'are but the ghosts of them that can labour n'more?'
LINE 347: "And I said, 'Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost champion of the
LINE 348: Achaeans, I came t'consult Teiresias, and see if he could advise me
LINE 349: about my return home t'Ithaca, for I have never yet been able t'get
LINE 350: near the Achaean land, nor t'set foot in my own country, but have been
LINE 351: in trouble all the time. As for you, Achilles, n'one was ever yet so
LINE 352: fortunate as you have been, nor ever will be, for you were adored by
LINE 353: all us Argives as long as you were alive, and now that you are here you
LINE 354: are a great prince among the dead. D'not, therefore, take it s'much
LINE 355: t'heart even if you are dead.'
LINE 356: "'Say not a word,' he answered, 'in death's favour; I would rather be a
LINE 357: paid servant in a poor man's house and be above ground than king of
LINE 358: kings among the dead. But give me news about my son; is he gone t'the
LINE 359: wars and will he be a great soldier, or is this not so? Tell me als'if
LINE 360: you have heard anything about my father Peleusâ€”does he still rule among
LINE 361: the Myrmidons, or d'they show him n'respect throughout Hellas and
LINE 362: Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by
LINE 363: his side, in the light of day, with the same strength that I had when I
LINE 364: killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troyâ€”could I but be as
LINE 365: I then was and g'even for a short time t'my father's house, any one
LINE 366: wh'tried t'd'him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.'
LINE 367: "'I have heard nothing,' I answered, 'of Peleus, but I can tell you all
LINE 368: about your son Neoptolemus, for I took him in my own ship from Scyros
LINE 369: with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always
LINE 370: first t'speak, and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the
LINE 371: only tw'wh'could surpass him; and when it came t'fighting on the
LINE 372: plain of Troy, he would never remain with the body of his men, but
LINE 373: would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valour. Many a man
LINE 374: did he kill in battleâ€”I cannot name every single one of those whom he
LINE 375: slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how
LINE 376: he killed that valiant her'Eurypylus son of Telephus, wh'was the
LINE 377: handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others als'of the
LINE 378: Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when
LINE 379: all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had
LINE 380: made, and it was left t'me t'settle when we should either open the
LINE 381: door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other leaders and
LINE 382: chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every
LINE 383: limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he
LINE 384: was all the time urging me t'break out from the horseâ€”grasping the
LINE 385: handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury
LINE 386: against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his
LINE 387: handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the
LINE 388: fortune of war) without a wound upon him, neither from a thrown spear
LINE 389: nor in close combat, for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.'
LINE 390: "When I had told him this, the ghost of Achilles strode off across a
LINE 391: meadow full of asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the
LINE 392: prowess of his son.
LINE 393: "The ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own
LINE 394: melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloofâ€”still
LINE 395: angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour
LINE 396: of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize, but the Trojan prisoners
LINE 397: and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in
LINE 398: such a contest, for it cost the life of Ajax, wh'was foremost of all
LINE 399: the Danaans after the son of Peleus, alike in stature and prowess.
LINE 400: "When I saw him I tried t'pacify him and said, 'Ajax, will you not
LINE 401: forget and forgive even in death, but must the judgement about that
LINE 402: hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to
LINE 403: lose such a tower of strength as you were t'us. We mourned you as much
LINE 404: as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself, nor can the blame be laid
LINE 405: on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans, for
LINE 406: it was this that made him counsel your destructionâ€”come hither,
LINE 407: therefore, bring your proud spirit int'subjection, and hear what I can
LINE 408: tell you.'
LINE 409: "He would not answer, but turned away t'Erebus and t'the other
LINE 410: ghosts; nevertheless, I should have made him talk t'me in spite of his
LINE 411: being s'angry, or I should have gone on talking t'him,97 only that
LINE 412: there were still others among the dead whom I desired t'see.
LINE 413: "Then I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand
LINE 414: sitting in judgement on the dead, and the ghosts were gathered sitting
LINE 415: and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades, t'learn his
LINE 416: sentences upon them.
LINE 417: "After him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the
LINE 418: ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains, and he
LINE 419: had a great bronze club in his hand, unbreakable for ever and ever.
LINE 420: "And I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering
LINE 421: some nine acres of ground. Tw'vultures on either side of him were
LINE 422: digging their beaks int'his liver, and he kept on trying t'beat them
LINE 423: off with his hands, but could not; for he had violated Jove's mistress
LINE 424: Let'as she was going through Panopeus on her way t'Pytho.
LINE 425: "I saw als'the dreadful fate of Tantalus, wh'stood in a lake that
LINE 426: reached his chin; he was dying t'quench his thirst, but could never
LINE 427: reach the water, for whenever the poor creature stooped t'drink, it
LINE 428: dried up and vanished, s'that there was nothing but dry groundâ€”parched
LINE 429: by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees, moreover, that shed
LINE 430: their fruit over his headâ€”pears, pomegranates, apples, sweet figs and
LINE 431: juicy olives, but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to
LINE 432: take some, the wind tossed the branches back again t'the clouds.
LINE 433: "And I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone
LINE 434: with both his hands. With hands and feet he tried t'roll it up t'the
LINE 435: top of the hill, but always, just before he could roll it over on to
LINE 436: the other side, its weight would be to'much for him, and the pitiless
LINE 437: stone98 would come thundering down again on t'the plain. Then he would
LINE 438: begin trying t'push it up hill again, and the sweat ran off him and
LINE 439: the steam rose after him.
LINE 440: "After him I saw mighty Hercules, but it was his phantom only, for he
LINE 441: is feasting ever with the immortal gods, and has lovely Hebe t'wife,
LINE 442: wh'is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him
LINE 443: like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with
LINE 444: his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string, glaring around
LINE 445: as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a
LINE 446: wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears,
LINE 447: wild boars, and lions with gleaming eyes; there was als'war, battle,
LINE 448: and death. The man wh'made that belt, d'what he might, would never be
LINE 449: able t'make another like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me,
LINE 450: and spoke piteously, saying, 'My poor Ulysses, noble son of Laertes,
LINE 451: are you to'leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was
LINE 452: above ground? I was son of Jove, but I went through an infinity of
LINE 453: suffering, for I became bondsman t'one wh'was far beneath meâ€”a low
LINE 454: fellow wh'set me all manner of labours. He once sent me here t'fetch
LINE 455: the hell-houndâ€”for he did not think he could find anything harder for
LINE 456: me than this, but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him t'him,
LINE 457: for Mercury and Minerva helped me.'
LINE 458: "On this Hercules went down again int'the house of Hades, but I stayed
LINE 459: where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come t'me.
LINE 460: And I should have seen still other of them that are gone before, whom I
LINE 461: would fain have seenâ€”Theseus and Pirithousâ€”glorious children of the
LINE 462: gods, but s'many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such
LINE 463: appalling cries, that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send
LINE 464: up from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On
LINE 465: this I hastened back t'my ship and ordered my men t'g'on board at
LINE 466: once and loose the hawsers; s'they embarked and took their places,
LINE 467: whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had to
LINE 468: row at first, but presently a fair wind sprang up.
