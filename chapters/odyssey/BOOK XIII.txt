LINE 1: ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS T'ITHACA.
LINE 2: Thus did he speak, and they all held their peace throughout the covered
LINE 3: cloister, enthralled by the charm of his story, till presently Alcinous
LINE 4: began t'speak.
LINE 5: "Ulysses," said he, "now that you have reached my house I doubt not you
LINE 6: will get home without further misadventure n'matter how much you have
LINE 7: suffered in the past. T'you others, however, wh'come here night after
LINE 8: night t'drink my choicest wine and listen t'my bard, I would insist
LINE 9: as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes, wrought
LINE 10: gold,108 and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;
LINE 11: let us now, therefore, present him further, each one of us, with a
LINE 12: large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a
LINE 13: general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected t'bear the
LINE 14: burden of such a handsome present."
LINE 15: Every one approved of this, and then they went home t'bed each in his
LINE 16: own abode. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they
LINE 17: hurried down t'the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.
LINE 18: Alcinous went on board and saw everything s'securely stowed under the
LINE 19: ship's benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.
LINE 20: Then they went t'the house of Alcinous t'get dinner, and he
LINE 21: sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove wh'is the lord of all.
LINE 22: They set the steaks t'grill and made an excellent dinner, after which
LINE 23: the inspired bard, Demodocus, wh'was a favourite with every one, sang
LINE 24: t'them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun, as
LINE 25: though t'hasten his setting, for he was longing t'be on his way. As
LINE 26: one wh'has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen
LINE 27: keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he
LINE 28: may g'and get it, for it is all his legs can d't'carry him, even so
LINE 29: did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down, and he at once said t'the
LINE 30: Phaeacians, addressing himself more particularly t'King Alcinous:
LINE 31: "Sir, and all of you, farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me
LINE 32: on my way rejoicing, for you have fulfilled my heart's desire by giving
LINE 33: me an escort, and making me presents, which heaven grant that I may
LINE 34: turn t'good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace
LINE 35: among friends,109 and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction
LINE 36: t'your wives and children;110 may heaven vouchsafe you every good
LINE 37: grace, and may n'evil thing come among your people."
LINE 38: Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and
LINE 39: agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken
LINE 40: reasonably. Alcinous therefore said t'his servant, "Pontonous, mix
LINE 41: some wine and hand it round t'everybody, that we may offer a prayer to
LINE 42: father Jove, and speed our guest upon his way."
LINE 43: Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it t'every one in turn; the others
LINE 44: each from his own seat made a drink-offering t'the blessed gods that
LINE 45: live in heaven, but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands
LINE 46: of queen Arete.
LINE 47: "Farewell, queen," said he, "henceforward and for ever, till age and
LINE 48: death, the common lot of mankind, lay their hands upon you. I now take
LINE 49: my leave; be happy in this house with your children, your people, and
LINE 50: with king Alcinous."
LINE 51: As he spoke he crossed the threshold, and Alcinous sent a man to
LINE 52: conduct him t'his ship and t'the sea shore. Arete als'sent some
LINE 53: maidservants with him—one with a clean shirt and cloak, another to
LINE 54: carry his strong box, and a third with corn and wine. When they got to
LINE 55: the water side the crew took these things and put them on board, with
LINE 56: all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen
LINE 57: sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.
LINE 58: Then he to'went on board and lay down without a word, but the crew
LINE 59: took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone
LINE 60: t'which it had been bound. Thereon, when they began rowing out t'sea,
LINE 61: Ulysses fell int'a deep, sweet, and almost deathlike slumber.111
LINE 62: The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies
LINE 63: over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it
LINE 64: were the neck of a stallion, and a great wave of dark blue water
LINE 65: seethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course, and even a
LINE 66: falcon, swiftest of all birds, could not have kept pace with her. Thus,
LINE 67: then, she cut her way through the water, carrying one wh'was as
LINE 68: cunning as the gods, but wh'was now sleeping peacefully, forgetful of
LINE 69: all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves
LINE 70: of the weary sea.
LINE 71: When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began t'show,
LINE 72: the ship drew near t'land.112 Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the
LINE 73: old merman Phorcys, which lies between tw'points that break the line
LINE 74: of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of
LINE 75: wind and sea that rage outside, s'that, when once within it, a ship
LINE 76: may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is
LINE 77: a large olive tree, and at n'great distance a fine overarching cavern
LINE 78: sacred t'the nymphs wh'are called Naiads.113 There are mixing bowls
LINE 79: within it and wine-jars of stone, and the bees hive there. Moreover,
LINE 80: there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of
LINE 81: sea purple—very curious t'see—and at all times there is water within
LINE 82: it. It has tw'entrances, one facing North by which mortals can g'down
LINE 83: int'the cave, while the other comes from the South and is more
LINE 84: mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it, it is the way taken
LINE 85: by the gods.
LINE 86: Int'this harbour, then, they took their ship, for they knew the
LINE 87: place.114 She had s'much way upon her that she ran half her own length
LINE 88: on t'the shore;115 when, however, they had landed, the first thing
LINE 89: they did was t'lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the
LINE 90: ship, and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took
LINE 91: out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians t'give him
LINE 92: when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all
LINE 93: together by the root of the olive tree, away from the road, for fear
LINE 94: some passer by116 might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and
LINE 95: then they made the best of their way home again.
LINE 96: But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already
LINE 97: threatened Ulysses, s'he took counsel with Jove. "Father Jove," said
LINE 98: he, "I shall n'longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods,
LINE 99: if mortals like the Phaeacians, wh'are my own flesh and blood, show
LINE 100: such small regard for me. I said I would let Ulysses get home when he
LINE 101: had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home
LINE 102: at all, for I knew you had already nodded your head about it, and
LINE 103: promised that he should d'so; but now they have brought him in a ship
LINE 104: fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more
LINE 105: magnificent presents of bronze, gold, and raiment than he would ever
LINE 106: have brought back from Troy, if he had had his share of the spoil and
LINE 107: got home without misadventure."
LINE 108: And Jove answered, "What, 'Lord of the Earthquake, are you talking
LINE 109: about? The gods are by n'means wanting in respect for you. It would be
LINE 110: monstrous were they t'insult one s'old and honoured as you are. As
LINE 111: regards mortals, however, if any of them is indulging in insolence and
LINE 112: treating you disrespectfully, it will always rest with yourself t'deal
LINE 113: with him as you may think proper, s'd'just as you please."
LINE 114: "I should have done s'at once," replied Neptune, "if I were not
LINE 115: anxious t'avoid anything that might displease you; now, therefore, I
LINE 116: should like t'wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its
LINE 117: escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I
LINE 118: should als'like t'bury their city under a huge mountain."
LINE 119: "My good friend," answered Jove, "I should recommend you at the very
LINE 120: moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,
LINE 121: t'turn it int'a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will
LINE 122: astonish everybody, and you can then bury their city under the
LINE 123: mountain."
LINE 124: When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went t'Scheria where the
LINE 125: Phaeacians live, and stayed there till the ship, which was making rapid
LINE 126: way, had got close in. Then he went up t'it, turned it int'stone, and
LINE 127: drove it down with the flat of his hand s'as t'root it in the ground.
LINE 128: After this he went away.
LINE 129: The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves, and one would turn
LINE 130: towards his neighbour, saying, "Bless my heart, wh'is it that can have
LINE 131: rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting int'port? We could
LINE 132: see the whole of her only a moment ago."
LINE 133: This was how they talked, but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous
LINE 134: said, "I remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that
LINE 135: Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one s'safely over the
LINE 136: sea, and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from
LINE 137: an escort, and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my
LINE 138: old father used t'say, and now it is all coming true.117 Now therefore
LINE 139: let us all d'as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving
LINE 140: people escorts when they come here, and in the next let us sacrifice
LINE 141: twelve picked bulls t'Neptune that he may have mercy upon us, and not
LINE 142: bury our city under the high mountain." When the people heard this they
LINE 143: were afraid and got ready the bulls.
LINE 144: Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray t'king Neptune,
LINE 145: standing round his altar; and at the same time118 Ulysses woke up once
LINE 146: more upon his own soil. He had been s'long away that he did not know
LINE 147: it again; moreover, Jove's daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day, so
LINE 148: that people might not know of his having come, and that she might tell
LINE 149: him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and
LINE 150: friends recognising him119 until he had taken his revenge upon the
LINE 151: wicked suitors. Everything, therefore, seemed quite different to
LINE 152: him—the long straight tracks, the harbours, the precipices, and the
LINE 153: goodly trees, appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his
LINE 154: native land. S'he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and
LINE 155: cried aloud despairingly.
LINE 156: "Alas," he exclaimed, "among what manner of people am I fallen? Are
LINE 157: they savage and uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put
LINE 158: all this treasure, and which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over
LINE 159: there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone t'some other great
LINE 160: chief wh'would have been good t'me and given me an escort. As it is I
LINE 161: d'not know where t'put my treasure, and I cannot leave it here for
LINE 162: fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and
LINE 163: rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me, and have
LINE 164: left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to
LINE 165: Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants
LINE 166: chastise them, for he watches over everybody and punishes those wh'do
LINE 167: wrong. Still, I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have
LINE 168: gone off with any of them."
LINE 169: He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons, his gold and all his
LINE 170: clothes, but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about
LINE 171: not being in his own country, and wandered up and down by the shore of
LINE 172: the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up t'him
LINE 173: disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien, with a
LINE 174: good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her
LINE 175: comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he
LINE 176: saw her, and went straight up t'her.
LINE 177: "My friend," said he, "you are the first person whom I have met with in
LINE 178: this country; I salute you, therefore, and beg you t'be well disposed
LINE 179: towards me. Protect these my goods, and myself too, for I embrace your
LINE 180: knees and pray t'you as though you were a god. Tell me, then, and tell
LINE 181: me truly, what land and country is this? Wh'are its inhabitants? Am I
LINE 182: on an island, or is this the sea board of some continent?"
LINE 183: Minerva answered, "Stranger, you must be very simple, or must have come
LINE 184: from somewhere a long way off, not t'know what country this is. It is
LINE 185: a very celebrated place, and everybody knows it East and West. It is
LINE 186: rugged and not a good driving country, but it is by n'means a bad
LINE 187: island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also
LINE 188: wine, for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle als'and
LINE 189: goats; all kinds of timber grow here, and there are watering places
LINE 190: where the water never runs dry; so, sir, the name of Ithaca is known
LINE 191: even as far as Troy, which I understand t'be a long way off from this
LINE 192: Achaean country."
LINE 193: Ulysses was glad at finding himself, as Minerva told him, in his own
LINE 194: country, and he began t'answer, but he did not speak the truth, and
LINE 195: made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.
LINE 196: "I heard of Ithaca," said he, "when I was in Crete beyond the seas, and
LINE 197: now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as
LINE 198: much more behind me for my children, but am flying because I killed
LINE 199: Orsilochus son of Idomeneus, the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him
LINE 200: because he wanted t'rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so
LINE 201: much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of
LINE 202: the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as
LINE 203: vassal, but had set myself up as an independent ruler, s'I lay in wait
LINE 204: for him with one of my followers by the road side, and speared him as
LINE 205: he was coming int'town from the country. It was a very dark night and
LINE 206: nobody saw us; it was not known, therefore, that I had killed him, but
LINE 207: as soon as I had done s'I went t'a ship and besought the owners, who
LINE 208: were Phoenicians, t'take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis
LINE 209: where the Epeans rule, giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.
LINE 210: They meant n'guile, but the wind drove them off their course, and we
LINE 211: sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could d't'get
LINE 212: inside the harbour, and none of us said a word about supper though we
LINE 213: wanted it badly, but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were.
LINE 214: I was very tired and fell asleep directly, s'they took my goods out of
LINE 215: the ship, and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand.
LINE 216: Then they sailed away t'Sidonia, and I was left here in great distress
LINE 217: of mind."
LINE 218: Such was his story, but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.
LINE 219: Then she took the form of a woman, fair, stately, and wise, "He must be
LINE 220: indeed a shifty lying fellow," said she, "wh'could surpass you in all
LINE 221: manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare
LINE 222: devil that you are, full of guile, unwearying in deceit, can you not
LINE 223: drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood, even now that you are
LINE 224: in your own country again? We will say n'more, however, about this,
LINE 225: for we can both of us deceive upon occasion—you are the most
LINE 226: accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind, while I for
LINE 227: diplomacy and subtlety have n'equal among the gods. Did you not know
LINE 228: Jove's daughter Minerva—me, wh'have been ever with you, wh'kept watch
LINE 229: over you in all your troubles, and wh'made the Phaeacians take so
LINE 230: great a liking t'you? And now, again, I am come here t'talk things
LINE 231: over with you, and help you t'hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians
LINE 232: give you; I want t'tell you about the troubles that await you in your
LINE 233: own house; you have got t'face them, but tell n'one, neither man nor
LINE 234: woman, that you have come home again. Bear everything, and put up with
LINE 235: every man's insolence, without a word."
LINE 236: And Ulysses answered, "A man, goddess, may know a great deal, but you
LINE 237: are s'constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is
LINE 238: a hard matter for him t'know whether it is you or not. This much,
LINE 239: however, I know exceedingly well; you were very kind t'me as long as
LINE 240: we Achaeans were fighting before Troy, but from the day on which we
LINE 241: went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam, and heaven
LINE 242: dispersed us—from that day, Minerva, I saw n'more of you, and cannot
LINE 243: ever remember your coming t'my ship t'help me in a difficulty; I had
LINE 244: t'wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I
LINE 245: reached the city of the Phaeacians, where you encouraged me and took me
LINE 246: int'the town.120 And now, I beseech you in your father's name, tell me
LINE 247: the truth, for I d'not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in
LINE 248: some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you
LINE 249: have been saying. Tell me then truly, have I really got back t'my own
LINE 250: country?"
LINE 251: "You are always taking something of that sort in your head," replied
LINE 252: Minerva, "and that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you
LINE 253: are s'plausible, shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning
LINE 254: from s'long a voyage would at once have gone home t'see his wife and
LINE 255: children, but you d'not seem t'care about asking after them or
LINE 256: hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife, who
LINE 257: remains at home vainly grieving for you, and having n'peace night or
LINE 258: day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near
LINE 259: you, I was never uneasy about you, for I was certain you would get back
LINE 260: safely though you would lose all your men, and I did not wish to
LINE 261: quarrel with my uncle Neptune, wh'never forgave you for having blinded
LINE 262: his son.121 I will now, however, point out t'you the lie of the land,
LINE 263: and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old
LINE 264: merman Phorcys, and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of
LINE 265: it; [near it is the cave sacred t'the Naiads;122 here to'is the
LINE 266: overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable
LINE 267: hecatomb t'the nymphs, and this is the wooded mountain Neritum."
LINE 268: As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then
LINE 269: Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land, and kissed
LINE 270: the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed t'the nymphs,
LINE 271: saying, "Naiad nymphs, daughters of Jove, I made sure that I was never
LINE 272: again t'see you, now therefore I greet you with all loving
LINE 273: salutations, and I will bring you offerings as in the old days, if
LINE 274: Jove's redoubtable daughter will grant me life, and bring my son to
LINE 275: manhood."
LINE 276: "Take heart, and d'not trouble yourself about that," rejoined Minerva,
LINE 277: "let us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave, where
LINE 278: they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all."
LINE 279: Therewith she went down int'the cave t'look for the safest hiding
LINE 280: places, while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold, bronze, and
LINE 281: good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed
LINE 282: everything carefully away, and Minerva set a stone against the door of
LINE 283: the cave. Then the tw'sat down by the root of the great olive, and
LINE 284: consulted how t'compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.
LINE 285: "Ulysses," said Minerva, "noble son of Laertes, think how you can lay
LINE 286: hands on these disreputable people wh'have been lording it in your
LINE 287: house these three years, courting your wife and making wedding presents
LINE 288: t'her, while she does nothing but lament your absence, giving hope and
LINE 289: sending encouraging messages123 t'every one of them, but meaning the
LINE 290: very opposite of all she says."
LINE 291: And Ulysses answered, "In good truth, goddess, it seems I should have
LINE 292: come t'much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did, if you
LINE 293: had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best
LINE 294: avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage int'my heart as
LINE 295: on the day when we loosed Troy's fair diadem from her brow. Help me now
LINE 296: as you did then, and I will fight three hundred men, if you, goddess,
LINE 297: will be with me."
LINE 298: "Trust me for that," said she, "I will not lose sight of you when once
LINE 299: we set about it, and I imagine that some of those wh'are devouring
LINE 300: your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and
LINE 301: brains. I will begin by disguising you s'that n'human being shall
LINE 302: know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your
LINE 303: yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all wh'see
LINE 304: it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an
LINE 305: unseemly object in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the
LINE 306: son whom you left behind you. Then g'at once t'the swineherd wh'is
LINE 307: in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you,
LINE 308: and is devoted t'Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his
LINE 309: pigs near the rock that is called Raven124 by the fountain Arethusa,
LINE 310: where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their
LINE 311: manner. Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I
LINE 312: proceed t'Sparta and see your son, wh'is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon,
LINE 313: where he has gone t'try and find out whether you are still alive."125
LINE 314: "But why," said Ulysses, "did you not tell him, for you knew all about
LINE 315: it? Did you want him to't'g'sailing about amid all kinds of hardship
LINE 316: while others are eating up his estate?"
LINE 317: Minerva answered, "Never mind about him, I sent him that he might be
LINE 318: well spoken of for having gone. He is in n'sort of difficulty, but is
LINE 319: staying quite comfortably with Menelaus, and is surrounded with
LINE 320: abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out t'sea and are lying
LINE 321: in wait for him, for they mean t'kill him before he can get home. I do
LINE 322: not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those wh'are
LINE 323: now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves."
LINE 324: As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with
LINE 325: wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the flesh over
LINE 326: his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine
LINE 327: ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him,
LINE 328: and a tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she als'gave
LINE 329: him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with
LINE 330: a staff and a wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to
LINE 331: sling it over his shoulder.
LINE 332: When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted, and the goddess
LINE 333: went straight t'Lacedaemon t'fetch Telemachus.
