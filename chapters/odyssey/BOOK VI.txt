LINE 1: THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.
LINE 2: S'here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off
LINE 3: t'the country and city of the Phaeacians—a people wh'used t'live in
LINE 4: the fair town of Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes
LINE 5: were stronger than they and plundered them, s'their king Nausithous
LINE 6: moved them thence and settled them in Scheria, far from all other
LINE 7: people. He surrounded the city with a wall, built houses and temples,
LINE 8: and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone t'the
LINE 9: house of Hades, and King Alcinous, whose counsels were inspired of
LINE 10: heaven, was now reigning. T'his house, then, did Minerva hie in
LINE 11: furtherance of the return of Ulysses.
LINE 12: She went straight t'the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there
LINE 13: slept a girl wh'was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa, daughter t'King
LINE 14: Alcinous. Tw'maid servants were sleeping near her, both very pretty,
LINE 15: one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well made
LINE 16: folding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas's
LINE 17: daughter, wh'was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;
LINE 18: then, coming up t'the girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she
LINE 19: hovered over her head and said:
LINE 20: "Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about, t'have such a lazy
LINE 21: daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet you are
LINE 22: going t'be married almost immediately, and should not only be well
LINE 23: dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those wh'attend
LINE 24: you. This is the way t'get yourself a good name, and t'make your
LINE 25: father and mother proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a
LINE 26: washing day, and start at daybreak. I will come and help you s'that
LINE 27: you may have everything ready as soon as possible, for all the best
LINE 28: young men among your own people are courting you, and you are not going
LINE 29: t'remain a maid much longer. Ask your father, therefore, t'have a
LINE 30: waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak, t'take the rugs, robes, and
LINE 31: girdles, and you can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you
LINE 32: than walking, for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town."
LINE 33: When she had said this Minerva went away t'Olympus, which they say is
LINE 34: the everlasting home of the gods. Here n'wind beats roughly, and
LINE 35: neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine
LINE 36: and in a great peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are
LINE 37: illumined for ever and ever. This was the place t'which the goddess
LINE 38: went when she had given instructions t'the girl.
LINE 39: By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, wh'began wondering about her
LINE 40: dream; she therefore went t'the other end of the house t'tell her
LINE 41: father and mother all about it, and found them in their own room. Her
LINE 42: mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her
LINE 43: maids around her, and she happened t'catch her father just as he was
LINE 44: going out t'attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian
LINE 45: aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:
LINE 46: "Papa dear, could you manage t'let me have a good big waggon? I want
LINE 47: t'take all our dirty clothes t'the river and wash them. You are the
LINE 48: chief man here, s'it is only right that you should have a clean shirt
LINE 49: when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five sons
LINE 50: at home, tw'of them married, while the other three are good looking
LINE 51: bachelors; you know they always like t'have clean linen when they go
LINE 52: t'a dance, and I have been thinking about all this."
LINE 53: She did not say a word about her own wedding, for she did not like to,
LINE 54: but her father knew and said, "You shall have the mules, my love, and
LINE 55: whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the men shall
LINE 56: get you a good strong waggon with a body t'it that will hold all your
LINE 57: clothes."
LINE 58: On this he gave his orders t'the servants, wh'got the waggon out,
LINE 59: harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought the
LINE 60: clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her
LINE 61: mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good
LINE 62: things, and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got int'the waggon,
LINE 63: and her mother gave her als'a golden cruse of oil, that she and her
LINE 64: women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and
LINE 65: lashed the mules on, whereon they set off, and their hoofs clattered on
LINE 66: the road. They pulled without flagging, and carried not only Nausicaa
LINE 67: and her wash of clothes, but the maids als'wh'were with her.
LINE 68: When they reached the water side they went t'the washing cisterns,
LINE 69: through which there ran at all times enough pure water t'wash any
LINE 70: quantity of linen, n'matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules
LINE 71: and turned them out t'feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the
LINE 72: water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon, put them in the
LINE 73: water, and vied with one another in treading them in the pits t'get
LINE 74: the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean, they
LINE 75: laid them out by the sea side, where the waves had raised a high beach
LINE 76: of shingle, and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves
LINE 77: with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream,
LINE 78: and waited for the sun t'finish drying the clothes. When they had done
LINE 79: dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to
LINE 80: play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes
LINE 81: forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus t'hunt wild boars
LINE 82: or deer, and the wood nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, take
LINE 83: their sport along with her (then is Let'proud at seeing her daughter
LINE 84: stand a full head taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest
LINE 85: amid a whole bevy of beauties), even s'did the girl outshine her
LINE 86: handmaids.
LINE 87: When it was time for them t'start home, and they were folding the
LINE 88: clothes and putting them int'the waggon, Minerva began t'consider how
LINE 89: Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl wh'was t'conduct him
LINE 90: t'the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at one
LINE 91: of the maids, which missed her and fell int'deep water. On this they
LINE 92: all shouted, and the noise they made woke Ulysses, wh'sat up in his
LINE 93: bed of leaves and began t'wonder what it might all be.
LINE 94: "Alas," said he t'himself, "what kind of people have I come amongst?
LINE 95: Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilised, or hospitable and humane? I
LINE 96: seem t'hear the voices of young women, and they sound like those of
LINE 97: the nymphs that haunt mountain tops, or springs of rivers and meadows
LINE 98: of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me
LINE 99: try if I cannot manage t'get a look at them."
LINE 100: As he said this he crept from under his bush, and broke off a bough
LINE 101: covered with thick leaves t'hide his nakedness. He looked like some
LINE 102: lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and
LINE 103: defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of
LINE 104: oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even into
LINE 105: a well fenced homestead, trying t'get at the sheep—even such did
LINE 106: Ulysses seem t'the young women, as he drew near t'them all naked as
LINE 107: he was, for he was in great want. On seeing one s'unkempt and so
LINE 108: begrimed with salt water, the others scampered off along the spits that
LINE 109: jutted out int'the sea, but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm, for
LINE 110: Minerva put courage int'her heart and took away all fear from her. She
LINE 111: stood right in front of Ulysses, and he doubted whether he should g'up
LINE 112: t'her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her knees as a
LINE 113: suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her t'give him some
LINE 114: clothes and show him the way t'the town. In the end he deemed it best
LINE 115: t'entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence at
LINE 116: his coming near enough t'clasp her knees, s'he addressed her in
LINE 117: honeyed and persuasive language.
LINE 118: "'queen," he said, "I implore your aid—but tell me, are you a goddess
LINE 119: or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven, I
LINE 120: can only conjecture that you are Jove's daughter Diana, for your face
LINE 121: and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a
LINE 122: mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and
LINE 123: mother—thrice happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and
LINE 124: delighted they must feel when they see s'fair a scion as yourself
LINE 125: going out t'a dance; most happy, however, of all will he be whose
LINE 126: wedding gifts have been the richest, and wh'takes you t'his own home.
LINE 127: I never yet saw any one s'beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am
LINE 128: lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you t'a young
LINE 129: palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of
LINE 130: Apollo—for I was there, too, with much people after me, when I was on
LINE 131: that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet
LINE 132: did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I
LINE 133: admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at
LINE 134: yourself. I dare not clasp your knees, but I am in great distress;
LINE 135: yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the
LINE 136: sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian
LINE 137: island,55 and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure
LINE 138: still further suffering; for I d'not think that I have yet come t'the
LINE 139: end of it, but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for me.
LINE 140: "And now, 'queen, have pity upon me, for you are the first person I
LINE 141: have met, and I know n'one else in this country. Show me the way to
LINE 142: your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to
LINE 143: wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's
LINE 144: desire—husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing
LINE 145: better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a
LINE 146: house. It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends
LINE 147: glad, and they themselves know more about it than any one."
LINE 148: T'this Nausicaa answered, "Stranger, you appear t'be a sensible,
LINE 149: well-disposed person. There is n'accounting for luck; Jove gives
LINE 150: prosperity t'rich and poor just as he chooses, s'you must take what
LINE 151: he has seen fit t'send you, and make the best of it. Now, however,
LINE 152: that you have come t'this our country, you shall not want for clothes
LINE 153: nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look
LINE 154: for. I will show you the way t'the town, and will tell you the name of
LINE 155: our people; we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter t'Alcinous, in
LINE 156: whom the whole power of the state is vested."
LINE 157: Then she called her maids and said, "Stay where you are, you girls. Can
LINE 158: you not see a man without running away from him? D'you take him for a
LINE 159: robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here t'do
LINE 160: us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear t'the gods, and live apart on
LINE 161: a land's end that juts int'the sounding sea, and have nothing t'do
LINE 162: with any other people. This is only some poor man wh'has lost his way,
LINE 163: and we must be kind t'him, for strangers and foreigners in distress
LINE 164: are under Jove's protection, and will take what they can get and be
LINE 165: thankful; so, girls, give the poor fellow something t'eat and drink,
LINE 166: and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the
LINE 167: wind."
LINE 168: On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another
LINE 169: back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told
LINE 170: them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They als'brought him the
LINE 171: little golden cruse of oil, and told him t'g'and wash in the stream.
LINE 172: But Ulysses said, "Young women, please t'stand a little on one side
LINE 173: that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,
LINE 174: for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I
LINE 175: cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to
LINE 176: strip56 before a number of good looking young women."
LINE 177: Then they stood on one side and went t'tell the girl, while Ulysses
LINE 178: washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and
LINE 179: from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself, and
LINE 180: had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil, and
LINE 181: put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him
LINE 182: look taller and stronger than before, she als'made the hair grow thick
LINE 183: on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;
LINE 184: she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who
LINE 185: has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece
LINE 186: of silver plate by gilding it—and his work is full of beauty. Then he
LINE 187: went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking quite young
LINE 188: and handsome, and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said
LINE 189: t'her maids:
LINE 190: "Hush, my dears, for I want t'say something. I believe the gods who
LINE 191: live in heaven have sent this man t'the Phaeacians. When I first saw
LINE 192: him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the
LINE 193: gods wh'dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband t'be just
LINE 194: such another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want t'go
LINE 195: away. However, give him something t'eat and drink."
LINE 196: They did as they were told, and set food before Ulysses, wh'ate and
LINE 197: drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food of any kind.
LINE 198: Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen
LINE 199: folded and placed in the waggon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she
LINE 200: took her seat, she called Ulysses:
LINE 201: "Stranger," said she, "rise and let us be going back t'the town; I
LINE 202: will introduce you at the house of my excellent father, where I can
LINE 203: tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians.
LINE 204: But be sure and d'as I bid you, for you seem t'be a sensible person.
LINE 205: As long as we are going past the fields and farm lands, follow briskly
LINE 206: behind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.
LINE 207: Presently, however, we shall come t'the town, where you will find a
LINE 208: high wall running all round it, and a good harbour on either side with
LINE 209: a narrow entrance int'the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the
LINE 210: road side, for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You
LINE 211: will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it,
LINE 212: and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in
LINE 213: ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and sails, and here, too, are
LINE 214: the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians are not a nation of
LINE 215: archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a sea-faring
LINE 216: folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with which
LINE 217: they travel far over the sea.
LINE 218: "I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against
LINE 219: me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured, and some low
LINE 220: fellow, if he met us, might say, 'Wh'is this fine-looking stranger
LINE 221: that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose
LINE 222: she is going t'marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has
LINE 223: taken from some foreign vessel, for we have n'neighbours; or some god
LINE 224: has at last come down from heaven in answer t'her prayers, and she is
LINE 225: going t'live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good
LINE 226: thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else,
LINE 227: for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who
LINE 228: are in love with her.' This is the kind of disparaging remark that
LINE 229: would be made about me, and I could not complain, for I should myself
LINE 230: be scandalised at seeing any other girl d'the like, and g'about with
LINE 231: men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother were still
LINE 232: alive, and without having been married in the face of all the world.
LINE 233: "If, therefore, you want my father t'give you an escort and t'help
LINE 234: you home, d'as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by
LINE 235: the road side dedicated t'Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow
LINE 236: all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground, about
LINE 237: as far from the town as a man's voice will carry. Sit down there and
LINE 238: wait for a while till the rest of us can get int'the town and reach my
LINE 239: father's house. Then, when you think we must have done this, come into
LINE 240: the town and ask the way t'the house of my father Alcinous. You will
LINE 241: have n'difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out t'you,
LINE 242: for n'one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house
LINE 243: as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer
LINE 244: court, g'right across the inner court till you come t'my mother. You
LINE 245: will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by
LINE 246: firelight. It is a fine sight t'see her as she leans back against one
LINE 247: of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close t'her
LINE 248: seat stands that of my father, on which he sits and topes like an
LINE 249: immortal god. Never mind him, but g'up t'my mother, and lay your
LINE 250: hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her
LINE 251: over, you may hope t'see your own country again, n'matter how distant
LINE 252: it may be."
LINE 253: S'saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.
LINE 254: The mules drew well, and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.
LINE 255: She was careful not t'g'to'fast for Ulysses and the maids wh'were
LINE 256: following on foot along with the waggon, s'she plied her whip with
LINE 257: judgement. As the sun was going down they came t'the sacred grove of
LINE 258: Minerva, and there Ulysses sat down and prayed t'the mighty daughter
LINE 259: of Jove.
LINE 260: "Hear me," he cried, "daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove, unweariable, hear
LINE 261: me now, for you gave n'heed t'my prayers when Neptune was wrecking
LINE 262: me. Now, therefore, have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends
LINE 263: and be hospitably received by the Phaeacians."
LINE 264: Thus did he pray, and Minerva heard his prayer, but she would not show
LINE 265: herself t'him openly, for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune, wh'was
LINE 266: still furious in his endeavors t'prevent Ulysses from getting home.
