LINE 1: BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS—THE GAMES.
LINE 2: Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Alcinous
LINE 3: and Ulysses both rose, and Alcinous led the way t'the Phaeacian place
LINE 4: of assembly, which was near the ships. When they got there they sat
LINE 5: down side by side on a seat of polished stone, while Minerva took the
LINE 6: form of one of Alcinous' servants, and went round the town in order to
LINE 7: help Ulysses t'get home. She went up t'the citizens, man by man, and
LINE 8: said, "Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, come t'the
LINE 9: assembly all of you and listen t'the stranger wh'has just come off a
LINE 10: long voyage t'the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal
LINE 11: god."
LINE 12: With these words she made them all want t'come, and they flocked to
LINE 13: the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one
LINE 14: was struck with the appearance of Ulysses, for Minerva had beautified
LINE 15: him about the head and shoulders, making him look taller and stouter
LINE 16: than he really was, that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as
LINE 17: being a very remarkable man, and might come off well in the many trials
LINE 18: of skill t'which they would challenge him. Then, when they were got
LINE 19: together, Alcinous spoke:
LINE 20: "Hear me," said he, "aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,
LINE 21: that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger, whoever he may be,
LINE 22: has found his way t'my house from somewhere or other either East or
LINE 23: West. He wants an escort and wishes t'have the matter settled. Let us
LINE 24: then get one ready for him, as we have done for others before him;
LINE 25: indeed, n'one wh'ever yet came t'my house has been able t'complain
LINE 26: of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into
LINE 27: the sea—one that has never yet made a voyage—and man her with tw'and
LINE 28: fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your
LINE 29: oars each by his own seat, leave the ship and come t'my house to
LINE 30: prepare a feast.65 I will find you in everything. I am giving these
LINE 31: instructions t'the young men wh'will form the crew, for as regards
LINE 32: you aldermen and town councillors, you will join me in entertaining our
LINE 33: guest in the cloisters. I can take n'excuses, and we will have
LINE 34: Demodocus t'sing t'us; for there is n'bard like him whatever he may
LINE 35: choose t'sing about."
LINE 36: Alcinous then led the way, and the others followed after, while a
LINE 37: servant went t'fetch Demodocus. The fifty-tw'picked oarsmen went to
LINE 38: the sea shore as they had been told, and when they got there they drew
LINE 39: the ship int'the water, got her mast and sails inside her, bound the
LINE 40: oars t'the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather, all in due
LINE 41: course, and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a
LINE 42: little way out from land, and then came on shore and went t'the house
LINE 43: of King Alcinous. The out houses,66 yards, and all the precincts were
LINE 44: filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and
LINE 45: Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two
LINE 46: oxen. These they skinned and dressed s'as t'provide a magnificent
LINE 47: banquet.
LINE 48: A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus, whom the muse had
LINE 49: dearly loved, but t'whom she had given both good and evil, for though
LINE 50: she had endowed him with a divine gift of song, she had robbed him of
LINE 51: his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests, leaning it
LINE 52: up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his
LINE 53: head, and showed him where he was t'feel for it with his hands. He
LINE 54: als'set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side, and a cup
LINE 55: of wine from which he might drink whenever he was s'disposed.
LINE 56: The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before
LINE 57: them, but as soon as they had had enough t'eat and drink, the muse
LINE 58: inspired Demodocus t'sing the feats of heroes, and more especially a
LINE 59: matter that was then in the mouths of all men, t'wit, the quarrel
LINE 60: between Ulysses and Achilles, and the fierce words that they heaped on
LINE 61: one another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad
LINE 62: when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another, for Apollo
LINE 63: had foretold him this at Pyth'when he crossed the stone floor to
LINE 64: consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will
LINE 65: of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.
LINE 66: Thus sang the bard, but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head
LINE 67: and covered his face, for he was ashamed t'let the Phaeacians see that
LINE 68: he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from
LINE 69: his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a
LINE 70: drink-offering t'the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus
LINE 71: t'sing further, for they delighted in his lays, then Ulysses again
LINE 72: drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. N'one noticed his
LINE 73: distress except Alcinous, wh'was sitting near him, and heard the heavy
LINE 74: sighs that he was heaving. S'he at once said, "Aldermen and town
LINE 75: councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the
LINE 76: feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us
LINE 77: proceed therefore t'the athletic sports, s'that our guest on his
LINE 78: return home may be able t'tell his friends how much we surpass all
LINE 79: other nations as boxers, wrestlers, jumpers, and runners."
LINE 80: With these words he led the way, and the others followed after. A
LINE 81: servant hung Demodocus's lyre on its peg for him, led him out of the
LINE 82: cloister, and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief
LINE 83: men of the Phaeacians were going t'see the sports; a crowd of several
LINE 84: thousands of people followed them, and there were many excellent
LINE 85: competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos, Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus,
LINE 86: Prymneus, Anchialus, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineus,
LINE 87: and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was als'Euryalus
LINE 88: son of Naubolus, wh'was like Mars himself, and was the best looking
LINE 89: man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous,
LINE 90: Laodamas, Halios, and Clytoneus, competed also.
LINE 91: The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the
LINE 92: starting post, and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew
LINE 93: forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he
LINE 94: left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a
LINE 95: couple of mules can plough in a fallow field.67 They then turned t'the
LINE 96: painful art of wrestling, and here Euryalus proved t'be the best man.
LINE 97: Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the
LINE 98: disc there was n'one wh'could approach Elatreus. Alcinous's son
LINE 99: Laodamas was the best boxer, and he it was wh'presently said, when
LINE 100: they had all been diverted with the games, "Let us ask the stranger
LINE 101: whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully
LINE 102: built; his thighs, calves, hands, and neck are of prodigious strength,
LINE 103: nor is he at all old, but he has suffered much lately, and there is
LINE 104: nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man, n'matter how strong
LINE 105: he is."
LINE 106: "You are quite right, Laodamas," replied Euryalus, "g'up t'your guest
LINE 107: and speak t'him about it yourself."
LINE 108: When Laodamas heard this he made his way int'the middle of the crowd
LINE 109: and said t'Ulysses, "I hope, Sir, that you will enter yourself for
LINE 110: some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of
LINE 111: them—and you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is
LINE 112: nothing that does any one s'much credit all his life long as the
LINE 113: showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try
LINE 114: therefore at something, and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your
LINE 115: return home will not be long delayed, for the ship is already drawn
LINE 116: int'the water, and the crew is found."
LINE 117: Ulysses answered, "Laodamas, why d'you taunt me in this way? my mind
LINE 118: is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite
LINE 119: trouble, and am come among you now as a suppliant, praying your king
LINE 120: and people t'further me on my return home."
LINE 121: Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said, "I gather, then, that you
LINE 122: are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.
LINE 123: I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that g'about in ships
LINE 124: as captains or merchants, and wh'think of nothing but of their outward
LINE 125: freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem t'be much of the
LINE 126: athlete about you."
LINE 127: "For shame, Sir," answered Ulysses, fiercely, "you are an insolent
LINE 128: fellow—s'true is it that the gods d'not grace all men alike in
LINE 129: speech, person, and understanding. One man may be of weak presence, but
LINE 130: heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms
LINE 131: every one wh'sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with
LINE 132: him s'that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows, and wherever
LINE 133: he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god, but
LINE 134: his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No
LINE 135: god could make a finer looking fellow than you are, but you are a fool.
LINE 136: Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry, and you are
LINE 137: quite mistaken, for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed,
LINE 138: s'long as I had youth and strength, I was among the first athletes of
LINE 139: the age. Now, however, I am worn out by labour and sorrow, for I have
LINE 140: gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the
LINE 141: weary sea; still, in spite of all this I will compete, for your taunts
LINE 142: have stung me t'the quick."
LINE 143: S'he hurried up without even taking his cloak off, and seized a disc,
LINE 144: larger, more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians
LINE 145: when disc-throwing among themselves.68 Then, swinging it back, he threw
LINE 146: it from his brawny hand, and it made a humming sound in the air as he
LINE 147: did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it
LINE 148: sped gracefully from his hand, and flew beyond any mark that had been
LINE 149: made yet. Minerva, in the form of a man, came and marked the place
LINE 150: where it had fallen. "A blind man, Sir," said she, "could easily tell
LINE 151: your mark by groping for it—it is s'far ahead of any other. You may
LINE 152: make your mind easy about this contest, for n'Phaeacian can come near
LINE 153: t'such a throw as yours."
LINE 154: Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on, so
LINE 155: he began t'speak more pleasantly. "Young men," said he, "come up to
LINE 156: that throw if you can, and I will throw another disc as heavy or even
LINE 157: heavier. If anyone wants t'have a bout with me let him come on, for I
LINE 158: am exceedingly angry; I will box, wrestle, or run, I d'not care what
LINE 159: it is, with any man of you all except Laodamas, but not with him
LINE 160: because I am his guest, and one cannot compete with one's own personal
LINE 161: friend. At least I d'not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a
LINE 162: guest t'challenge his host's family at any game, especially when he is
LINE 163: in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if
LINE 164: he does; but I make n'exception as regards any one else, for I want to
LINE 165: have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at
LINE 166: every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent
LINE 167: archer. In battle I am always the first t'bring a man down with my
LINE 168: arrow, n'matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.
LINE 169: Philoctetes was the only man wh'could shoot better than I could when
LINE 170: we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one
LINE 171: else in the whole world, of those wh'still eat bread upon the face of
LINE 172: the earth, but I should not like t'shoot against the mighty dead, such
LINE 173: as Hercules, or Eurytus the Oechalian—men wh'could shoot against the
LINE 174: gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his
LINE 175: end, for Apoll'was angry with him and killed him because he challenged
LINE 176: him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can
LINE 177: shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am
LINE 178: afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me, for I have been brought
LINE 179: down very low at sea; my provisions ran short, and therefore I am still
LINE 180: weak."
LINE 181: They all held their peace except King Alcinous, wh'began, "Sir, we
LINE 182: have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us, from which
LINE 183: I understand that you are willing t'show your prowess, as having been
LINE 184: displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made t'you by one
LINE 185: of our athletes, and which could never have been uttered by any one who
LINE 186: knows how t'talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,
LINE 187: and will explain t'any one of your chief men wh'may be dining with
LINE 188: yourself and your family when you get home, that we have an hereditary
LINE 189: aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly
LINE 190: remarkable for our boxing, nor yet as wrestlers, but we are singularly
LINE 191: fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good
LINE 192: dinners, music, and dancing; we als'like frequent changes of linen,
LINE 193: warm baths, and good beds, s'now, please, some of you wh'are the best
LINE 194: dancers set about dancing, that our guest on his return home may be
LINE 195: able t'tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as
LINE 196: sailors, runners, dancers, and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre
LINE 197: at my house, s'run some one or other of you and fetch it for him."
LINE 198: On this a servant hurried off t'bring the lyre from the king's house,
LINE 199: and the nine men wh'had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was
LINE 200: their business t'manage everything connected with the sports, s'they
LINE 201: made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.
LINE 202: Presently the servant came back with Demodocus's lyre, and he took his
LINE 203: place in the midst of them, whereon the best young dancers in the town
LINE 204: began t'foot and trip it s'nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the
LINE 205: merry twinkling of their feet.
LINE 206: Meanwhile the bard began t'sing the loves of Mars and Venus, and how
LINE 207: they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus
LINE 208: many presents, and defiled King Vulcan's marriage bed, s'the sun, who
LINE 209: saw what they were about, told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he
LINE 210: heard such dreadful news, s'he went t'his smithy brooding mischief,
LINE 211: got his great anvil int'its place, and began t'forge some chains
LINE 212: which none could either unloose or break, s'that they might stay there
LINE 213: in that place.69 When he had finished his snare he went int'his
LINE 214: bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs;
LINE 215: he als'let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even
LINE 216: a god could see them s'fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had
LINE 217: spread the chains all over the bed, he made as though he were setting
LINE 218: out for the fair state of Lemnos, which of all places in the world was
LINE 219: the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept n'blind look out, and as
LINE 220: soon as he saw him start, hurried off t'his house, burning with love
LINE 221: for Venus.
LINE 222: Now Venus was just come in from a visit t'her father Jove, and was
LINE 223: about sitting down when Mars came inside the house, and said as he took
LINE 224: her hand in his own, "Let us g't'the couch of Vulcan: he is not at
LINE 225: home, but is gone off t'Lemnos among the Sintians, whose speech is
LINE 226: barbarous."
LINE 227: She was nothing loth, s'they went t'the couch t'take their rest,
LINE 228: whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread
LINE 229: for them, and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot, but found too
LINE 230: late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up t'them, for he had
LINE 231: turned back before reaching Lemnos, when his scout the sun told him
LINE 232: what was going on. He was in a furious passion, and stood in the
LINE 233: vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted t'all the gods.
LINE 234: "Father Jove," he cried, "and all you other blessed gods wh'live for
LINE 235: ever, come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I
LINE 236: will show you. Jove's daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because
LINE 237: I am lame. She is in love with Mars, wh'is handsome and clean built,
LINE 238: whereas I am a cripple—but my parents are t'blame for that, not I;
LINE 239: they ought never t'have begotten me. Come and see the pair together
LINE 240: asleep on my bed. It makes me furious t'look at them. They are very
LINE 241: fond of one another, but I d'not think they will lie there longer than
LINE 242: they can help, nor d'I think that they will sleep much; there,
LINE 243: however, they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave
LINE 244: him for his baggage of a daughter, wh'is fair but not honest."
LINE 245: On this the gods gathered t'the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling
LINE 246: Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo, but the
LINE 247: goddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all
LINE 248: good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with
LINE 249: inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,
LINE 250: whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:
LINE 251: "Ill deeds d'not prosper, and the weak confound the strong. See how
LINE 252: limping Vulcan, lame as he is, has caught Mars wh'is the fleetest god
LINE 253: in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages."
LINE 254: Thus did they converse, but King Apoll'said t'Mercury, "Messenger
LINE 255: Mercury, giver of good things, you would not care how strong the chains
LINE 256: were, would you, if you could sleep with Venus?"
LINE 257: "King Apollo," answered Mercury, "I only wish I might get the chance,
LINE 258: though there were three times as many chains—and you might look on, all
LINE 259: of you, gods and goddesses, but I would sleep with her if I could."
LINE 260: The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him, but Neptune
LINE 261: took it all seriously, and kept on imploring Vulcan t'set Mars free
LINE 262: again. "Let him go," he cried, "and I will undertake, as you require,
LINE 263: that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among
LINE 264: the immortal gods."
LINE 265: "D'not," replied Vulcan, "ask me t'd'this; a bad man's bond is bad
LINE 266: security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go
LINE 267: away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?"
LINE 268: "Vulcan," said Neptune, "if Mars goes away without paying his damages,
LINE 269: I will pay you myself." S'Vulcan answered, "In this case I cannot and
LINE 270: must not refuse you."
LINE 271: Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them, and as soon as they were
LINE 272: free they scampered off, Mars t'Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to
LINE 273: Cyprus and t'Paphos, where is her grove and her altar fragrant with
LINE 274: burnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her, and anointed her with oil
LINE 275: of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of, and they clothed her
LINE 276: in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.
LINE 277: Thus sang the bard, and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were
LINE 278: charmed as they heard him.
LINE 279: Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius t'dance alone, for there was no
LINE 280: one t'compete with them. S'they took a red ball which Polybus had
LINE 281: made for them, and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up
LINE 282: towards the clouds, while the other jumped from off the ground and
LINE 283: caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done
LINE 284: throwing the ball straight up int'the air they began t'dance, and at
LINE 285: the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards t'one
LINE 286: another, while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great
LINE 287: stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:
LINE 288: "King Alcinous, you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the
LINE 289: world, and indeed they have proved themselves t'be so. I was
LINE 290: astonished as I saw them."
LINE 291: The king was delighted at this, and exclaimed t'the Phaeacians,
LINE 292: "Aldermen and town councillors, our guest seems t'be a person of
LINE 293: singular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he
LINE 294: may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you, and
LINE 295: counting myself there are thirteen; contribute, each of you, a clean
LINE 296: cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in
LINE 297: a lump down at once, s'that when he gets his supper he may d's'with
LINE 298: a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have t'make a formal apology
LINE 299: and a present too, for he has been rude."
LINE 300: Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and
LINE 301: sent their servants t'fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, "King
LINE 302: Alcinous, I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He
LINE 303: shall have my sword, which is of bronze, all but the hilt, which is of
LINE 304: silver. I will als'give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into
LINE 305: which it fits. It will be worth a great deal t'him."
LINE 306: As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said, "Good
LINE 307: luck t'you, father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the
LINE 308: winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a safe return,
LINE 309: for I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone
LINE 310: through much hardship."
LINE 311: T'which Ulysses answered, "Good luck t'you to'my friend, and may the
LINE 312: gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you
LINE 313: have given me along with your apology."
LINE 314: With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards
LINE 315: sundown the presents began t'make their appearance, as the servants of
LINE 316: the donors kept bringing them t'the house of King Alcinous; here his
LINE 317: sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then
LINE 318: Alcinous led the way t'the house and bade his guests take their seats.
LINE 319: "Wife," said he, turning t'Queen Arete, "Go, fetch the best chest we
LINE 320: have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set a copper on the
LINE 321: fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see als'to
LINE 322: the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made
LINE 323: him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that
LINE 324: will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet—which is of
LINE 325: exquisite workmanship—that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his
LINE 326: life whenever he makes a drink offering t'Jove, or t'any of the
LINE 327: gods."70
LINE 328: Then Arete told her maids t'set a large tripod upon the fire as fast
LINE 329: as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on t'a
LINE 330: clear fire; they threw on sticks t'make it blaze, and the water became
LINE 331: hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.71 Meanwhile
LINE 332: Arete brought a magnificent chest from her own room, and inside it she
LINE 333: packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the
LINE 334: Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from
LINE 335: Alcinous, and said t'Ulysses:
LINE 336: "See t'the lid yourself, and have the whole bound round at once, for
LINE 337: fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your
LINE 338: ship." 72
LINE 339: When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast
LINE 340: with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done s'before an upper
LINE 341: servant told him t'come t'the bath and wash himself. He was very glad
LINE 342: of a warm bath, for he had had n'one t'wait upon him ever since he
LINE 343: left the house of Calypso, wh'as long as he remained with her had
LINE 344: taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the
LINE 345: servants had done washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him
LINE 346: a clean cloak and shirt, he left the bath room and joined the guests
LINE 347: wh'were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the
LINE 348: bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister, and admired him as
LINE 349: she saw him pass. "Farewell stranger," said she, "d'not forget me when
LINE 350: you are safe at home again, for it is t'me first that you owe a ransom
LINE 351: for having saved your life."
LINE 352: And Ulysses said, "Nausicaa, daughter of great Alcinous, may Jove the
LINE 353: mighty husband of Juno, grant that I may reach my home; s'shall I
LINE 354: bless you as my guardian angel all my days, for it was you wh'saved
LINE 355: me."
LINE 356: When he had said this, he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was
LINE 357: then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the
LINE 358: favourite bard Demodocus, and set him in the midst of the company, near
LINE 359: one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister, that he might lean
LINE 360: against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of
LINE 361: fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said t'a servant,
LINE 362: "Take this piece of pork over t'Demodocus and tell him t'eat it; for
LINE 363: all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;
LINE 364: bards are honoured and respected throughout the world, for the muse
LINE 365: teaches them their songs and loves them."
LINE 366: The servant carried the pork in his fingers over t'Demodocus, wh'took
LINE 367: it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good
LINE 368: things that were before them, and as soon as they had had t'eat and
LINE 369: drink, Ulysses said t'Demodocus, "Demodocus, there is n'one in the
LINE 370: world whom I admire more than I d'you. You must have studied under the
LINE 371: Muse, Jove's daughter, and under Apollo, s'accurately d'you sing the
LINE 372: return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you
LINE 373: were not there yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who
LINE 374: was. Now, however, change your song and tell us of the wooden horse
LINE 375: which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva, and which Ulysses got
LINE 376: by stratagem int'the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who
LINE 377: afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will
LINE 378: tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you."
LINE 379: The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some
LINE 380: of the Argives set fire t'their tents and sailed away while others,
LINE 381: hidden within the horse,73 were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan
LINE 382: place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into
LINE 383: their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council round it,
LINE 384: and were in three minds as t'what they should do. Some were for
LINE 385: breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged t'the top
LINE 386: of the rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the
LINE 387: precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering
LINE 388: and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the
LINE 389: end, for the city was doomed when it took in that horse, within which
LINE 390: were all the bravest of the Argives waiting t'bring death and
LINE 391: destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans
LINE 392: issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their
LINE 393: ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and
LINE 394: ravaged it, and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus
LINE 395: t'the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most
LINE 396: furiously, nevertheless by Minerva's help he was victorious.
LINE 397: All this he told, but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him, and his
LINE 398: cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws
LINE 399: herself on the body of her husband wh'has fallen before his own city
LINE 400: and people, fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She
LINE 401: screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for
LINE 402: breath and dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back
LINE 403: and shoulders, and carry her off int'slavery, t'a life of labour and
LINE 404: sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks—even s'piteously did
LINE 405: Ulysses weep, but none of those present perceived his tears except
LINE 406: Alcinous, wh'was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs
LINE 407: that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:
LINE 408: "Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, let Demodocus cease
LINE 409: his song, for there are those present wh'd'not seem t'like it. From
LINE 410: the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began t'sing, our
LINE 411: guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in
LINE 412: great trouble, s'let the bard leave off, that we may all enjoy
LINE 413: ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should
LINE 414: be, for all these festivities, with the escort and the presents that we
LINE 415: are making with s'much good will are wholly in his honour, and any one
LINE 416: with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to
LINE 417: treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.
LINE 418: "Therefore, Sir, d'you on your part affect n'more concealment nor
LINE 419: reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more
LINE 420: polite in you t'give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your
LINE 421: father and mother over yonder used t'call you, and by which you were
LINE 422: known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is n'one,
LINE 423: neither rich nor poor, wh'is absolutely without any name whatever, for
LINE 424: people's fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.
LINE 425: Tell me als'your country, nation, and city, that our ships may shape
LINE 426: their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have
LINE 427: n'pilots; their vessels have n'rudders as those of other nations
LINE 428: have, but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are
LINE 429: thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the
LINE 430: whole world, and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is
LINE 431: covered with mist and cloud, s'that there is n'danger of being
LINE 432: wrecked or coming t'any harm. Still I d'remember hearing my father
LINE 433: say that Neptune was angry with us for being to'easy-going in the
LINE 434: matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he
LINE 435: should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted
LINE 436: some one,74 and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my
LINE 437: father used t'say, but whether the god will carry out his threat or no
LINE 438: is a matter which he will decide for himself.
LINE 439: "And now, tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering, and
LINE 440: in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples
LINE 441: themselves, and of their cities—wh'were hostile, savage and
LINE 442: uncivilised, and who, on the other hand, hospitable and humane. Tell us
LINE 443: als'why you are made s'unhappy on hearing about the return of the
LINE 444: Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this, and sent them
LINE 445: their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something
LINE 446: t'sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife's when you
LINE 447: were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law—which are the nearest
LINE 448: relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some
LINE 449: brave and kindly-natured comrade—for a good friend is as dear t'a man
LINE 450: as his own brother?"
