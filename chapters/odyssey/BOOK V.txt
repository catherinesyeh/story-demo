LINE 1: CALYPSO—ULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.
LINE 2: And now, as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus—harbinger of light
LINE 3: alike t'mortals and immortals—the gods met in council and with them,
LINE 4: Jove the lord of thunder, wh'is their king. Thereon Minerva began to
LINE 5: tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses, for she pitied him away
LINE 6: there in the house of the nymph Calypso.
LINE 7: "Father Jove," said she, "and all you other gods that live in
LINE 8: everlasting bliss, I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and
LINE 9: well-disposed ruler any more, nor one wh'will govern equitably. I hope
LINE 10: they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust, for there is not one of
LINE 11: his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses, wh'ruled them as though he
LINE 12: were their father. There he is, lying in great pain in an island where
LINE 13: dwells the nymph Calypso, wh'will not let him go; and he cannot get
LINE 14: back t'his own country, for he can find neither ships nor sailors to
LINE 15: take him over the sea. Furthermore, wicked people are now trying to
LINE 16: murder his only son Telemachus, wh'is coming home from Pylos and
LINE 17: Lacedaemon, where he has been t'see if he can get news of his father."
LINE 18: "What, my dear, are you talking about?" replied her father, "did you
LINE 19: not send him there yourself, because you thought it would help Ulysses
LINE 20: t'get home and punish the suitors? Besides, you are perfectly able to
LINE 21: protect Telemachus, and t'see him safely home again, while the suitors
LINE 22: have t'come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him."
LINE 23: When he had thus spoken, he said t'his son Mercury, "Mercury, you are
LINE 24: our messenger, g'therefore and tell Calyps'we have decreed that poor
LINE 25: Ulysses is t'return home. He is t'be convoyed neither by gods nor
LINE 26: men, but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to
LINE 27: reach fertile Scheria,50 the land of the Phaeacians, wh'are near of
LINE 28: kin t'the gods, and will honour him as though he were one of
LINE 29: ourselves. They will send him in a ship t'his own country, and will
LINE 30: give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought
LINE 31: back from Troy, if he had had all his prize money and had got home
LINE 32: without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to
LINE 33: his country and his friends."
LINE 34: Thus he spoke, and Mercury, guide and guardian, slayer of Argus, did as
LINE 35: he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with
LINE 36: which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand
LINE 37: with which he seals men's eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he
LINE 38: pleases, and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped
LINE 39: down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea, whose
LINE 40: waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and
LINE 41: corner of the ocean, and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He
LINE 42: flew and flew over many a weary wave, but when at last he got t'the
LINE 43: island which was his journey's end, he left the sea and went on by land
LINE 44: till he came t'the cave where the nymph Calyps'lived.
LINE 45: He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth, and
LINE 46: one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal
LINE 47: wood. As for herself, she was busy at her loom, shooting her golden
LINE 48: shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there
LINE 49: was a thick wood of alder, poplar, and sweet smelling cypress trees,
LINE 50: wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests—owls, hawks, and
LINE 51: chattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine
LINE 52: loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of
LINE 53: the cave; there were als'four running rills of water in channels cut
LINE 54: pretty close together, and turned hither and thither s'as t'irrigate
LINE 55: the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. 51
LINE 56: Even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot, so
LINE 57: Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it
LINE 58: sufficiently he went inside the cave.
LINE 59: Calyps'knew him at once—for the gods all know each other, n'matter
LINE 60: how far they live from one another—but Ulysses was not within; he was
LINE 61: on the sea-shore as usual, looking out upon the barren ocean with tears
LINE 62: in his eyes, groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calyps'gave
LINE 63: Mercury a seat and said: "Why have you come t'see me,
LINE 64: Mercury—honoured, and ever welcome—for you d'not visit me often? Say
LINE 65: what you want; I will d'it for you at once if I can, and if it can be
LINE 66: done at all; but come inside, and let me set refreshment before you."
LINE 67: As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed
LINE 68: him some red nectar, s'Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,
LINE 69: and then said:
LINE 70: "We are speaking god and goddess t'one another, and you ask me why I
LINE 71: have come here, and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove
LINE 72: sent me; it was n'doing of mine; wh'could possibly want t'come all
LINE 73: this way over the sea where there are n'cities full of people t'offer
LINE 74: me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had t'come, for none
LINE 75: of us other gods can cross Jove, nor transgress his orders. He says
LINE 76: that you have here the most ill-starred of all those wh'fought nine
LINE 77: years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year
LINE 78: after having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against
LINE 79: Minerva,52 wh'raised both wind and waves against them, s'that all his
LINE 80: brave companions perished, and he alone was carried hither by wind and
LINE 81: tide. Jove says that you are t'let this man g'at once, for it is
LINE 82: decreed that he shall not perish here, far from his own people, but
LINE 83: shall return t'his house and country and see his friends again."
LINE 84: Calyps'trembled with rage when she heard this, "You gods," she
LINE 85: exclaimed, "ought t'be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous
LINE 86: and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy t'a mortal man, and live with
LINE 87: him in open matrimony. S'when rosy-fingered Dawn made love t'Orion,
LINE 88: you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed
LINE 89: him in Ortygia. S'again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion, and
LINE 90: yielded t'him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field, Jove came t'hear of
LINE 91: it before s'very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now
LINE 92: you are angry with me to'because I have a man here. I found the poor
LINE 93: creature sitting all alone astride of a keel, for Jove had struck his
LINE 94: ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean, s'that all his crew were
LINE 95: drowned, while he himself was driven by wind and waves on t'my island.
LINE 96: I got fond of him and cherished him, and had set my heart on making him
LINE 97: immortal, s'that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot
LINE 98: cross Jove, nor bring his counsels t'nothing; therefore, if he insists
LINE 99: upon it, let the man g'beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him
LINE 100: anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men wh'can take him.
LINE 101: Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice, in all good faith, as
LINE 102: will be likely t'bring him safely t'his own country."
LINE 103: "Then send him away," said Mercury, "or Jove will be angry with you and
LINE 104: punish you".
LINE 105: On this he took his leave, and Calyps'went out t'look for Ulysses,
LINE 106: for she had heard Jove's message. She found him sitting upon the beach
LINE 107: with his eyes ever filled with tears, and dying of sheer home sickness;
LINE 108: for he had got tired of Calypso, and though he was forced t'sleep with
LINE 109: her in the cave by night, it was she, not he, that would have it so. As
LINE 110: for the day time, he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore,
LINE 111: weeping, crying aloud for his despair, and always looking out upon the
LINE 112: sea. Calyps'then went close up t'him said:
LINE 113: "My poor fellow, you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your
LINE 114: life out any longer. I am going t'send you away of my own free will;
LINE 115: s'go, cut some beams of wood, and make yourself a large raft with an
LINE 116: upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread,
LINE 117: wine, and water on board t'save you from starving. I will als'give
LINE 118: you clothes, and will send you a fair wind t'take you home, if the
LINE 119: gods in heaven s'will it—for they know more about these things, and
LINE 120: can settle them better than I can."
LINE 121: Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. "Now goddess," he answered, "there
LINE 122: is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning t'help me
LINE 123: home when you bid me d'such a dreadful thing as put t'sea on a raft.
LINE 124: Not even a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a
LINE 125: distant voyage: nothing that you can say or d'shall make me g'on
LINE 126: board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no
LINE 127: mischief."
LINE 128: Calyps'smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: "You know a
LINE 129: great deal," said she, "but you are quite wrong here. May heaven above
LINE 130: and earth below be my witnesses, with the waters of the river Styx—and
LINE 131: this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take—that I mean
LINE 132: you n'sort of harm, and am only advising you t'd'exactly what I
LINE 133: should d'myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite
LINE 134: straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron, and I am very sorry
LINE 135: for you."
LINE 136: When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him, and
LINE 137: Ulysses followed in her steps; s'the pair, goddess and man, went on
LINE 138: and on till they came t'Calypso's cave, where Ulysses took the seat
LINE 139: that Mercury had just left. Calyps'set meat and drink before him of
LINE 140: the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar
LINE 141: for herself, and they laid their hands on the good things that were
LINE 142: before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,
LINE 143: Calyps'spoke, saying:
LINE 144: "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, s'you would start home t'your own
LINE 145: land at once? Good luck g'with you, but if you could only know how
LINE 146: much suffering is in store for you before you get back t'your own
LINE 147: country, you would stay where you are, keep house along with me, and
LINE 148: let me make you immortal, n'matter how anxious you may be t'see this
LINE 149: wife of yours, of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet
LINE 150: I flatter myself that I am n'whit less tall or well-looking than she
LINE 151: is, for it is not t'be expected that a mortal woman should compare in
LINE 152: beauty with an immortal."
LINE 153: "Goddess," replied Ulysses, "d'not be angry with me about this. I am
LINE 154: quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like s'tall or so
LINE 155: beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman, whereas you are an
LINE 156: immortal. Nevertheless, I want t'get home, and can think of nothing
LINE 157: else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea, I will bear it and
LINE 158: make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea
LINE 159: already, s'let this g'with the rest."
LINE 160: Presently the sun set and it became dark, whereon the pair retired into
LINE 161: the inner part of the cave and went t'bed.
LINE 162: When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, Ulysses put on
LINE 163: his shirt and cloak, while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer
LINE 164: fabric, very fine and graceful, with a beautiful golden girdle about
LINE 165: her waist and a veil t'cover her head. She at once set herself to
LINE 166: think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. S'she gave him a great
LINE 167: bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and
LINE 168: had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on t'it. She als'gave
LINE 169: him a sharp adze, and then led the way t'the far end of the island
LINE 170: where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached the
LINE 171: sky—very dry and well seasoned, s'as t'sail light for him in the
LINE 172: water.53 Then, when she had shown him where the best trees grew,
LINE 173: Calyps'went home, leaving him t'cut them, which he soon finished
LINE 174: doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring
LINE 175: them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calyps'came back
LINE 176: with some augers, s'he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers
LINE 177: together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled
LINE 178: shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top
LINE 179: of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all round it. He als'made a mast with a
LINE 180: yard arm, and a rudder t'steer with. He fenced the raft all round with
LINE 181: wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves, and then he threw on
LINE 182: a quantity of wood. By and by Calyps'brought him some linen t'make
LINE 183: the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them fast with
LINE 184: braces and sheets. Last of all, with the help of levers, he drew the
LINE 185: raft down int'the water.
LINE 186: In four days he had completed the whole work, and on the fifth Calypso
LINE 187: sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean
LINE 188: clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and another
LINE 189: larger one of water; she als'gave him a wallet full of provisions, and
LINE 190: found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm
LINE 191: for him, and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it, while he sat
LINE 192: and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed
LINE 193: his eyes, but kept them fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Bootes,
LINE 194: and on the Bear—which men als'call the wain, and which turns round and
LINE 195: round where it is, facing Orion, and alone never dipping int'the
LINE 196: stream of Oceanus—for Calyps'had told him t'keep this t'his left.
LINE 197: Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth the
LINE 198: dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian
LINE 199: coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.
LINE 200: But King Neptune, wh'was returning from the Ethiopians, caught sight
LINE 201: of Ulysses a long way off, from the mountains of the Solymi. He could
LINE 202: see him sailing upon the sea, and it made him very angry, s'he wagged
LINE 203: his head and muttered t'himself, saying, "Good heavens, s'the gods
LINE 204: have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in
LINE 205: Ethiopia, and now he is close t'the land of the Phaeacians, where it
LINE 206: is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen
LINE 207: him. Still, he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done
LINE 208: with it."
LINE 209: Thereon he gathered his clouds together, grasped his trident, stirred
LINE 210: it round in the sea, and roused the rage of every wind that blows till
LINE 211: earth, sea, and sky were hidden in cloud, and night sprang forth out of
LINE 212: the heavens. Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him all
LINE 213: at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, s'that Ulysses' heart
LINE 214: began t'fail him. "Alas," he said t'himself in his dismay, "what ever
LINE 215: will become of me? I am afraid Calyps'was right when she said I should
LINE 216: have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How
LINE 217: black is Jove making heaven with his clouds, and what a sea the winds
LINE 218: are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe t'perish. Blest
LINE 219: and thrice blest were those Danaans wh'fell before Troy in the cause
LINE 220: of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when the
LINE 221: Trojans were pressing me s'sorely about the dead body of Achilles, for
LINE 222: then I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured
LINE 223: my name; but now it seems that I shall come t'a most pitiable end."
LINE 224: As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft
LINE 225: reeled again, and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go
LINE 226: the helm, and the force of the hurricane was s'great that it broke the
LINE 227: mast half way up, and both sail and yard went over int'the sea. For a
LINE 228: long time Ulysses was under water, and it was all he could d't'rise
LINE 229: t'the surface again, for the clothes Calyps'had given him weighed him
LINE 230: down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter
LINE 231: brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,
LINE 232: however, he did not lose sight of his raft, but swam as fast as he
LINE 233: could towards it, got hold of it, and climbed on board again s'as to
LINE 234: escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn
LINE 235: winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though
LINE 236: the South, North, East, and West winds were all playing battledore and
LINE 237: shuttlecock with it at once.
LINE 238: When he was in this plight, In'daughter of Cadmus, als'called
LINE 239: Leucothea, saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal, but had been
LINE 240: since raised t'the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great
LINE 241: distress Ulysses now was, she had compassion upon him, and, rising like
LINE 242: a sea-gull from the waves, took her seat upon the raft.
LINE 243: "My poor good man," said she, "why is Neptune s'furiously angry with
LINE 244: you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble, but for all his bluster
LINE 245: he will not kill you. You seem t'be a sensible person, d'then as I
LINE 246: bid you; strip, leave your raft t'drive before the wind, and swim to
LINE 247: the Phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here, take my
LINE 248: veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted, and you can come to
LINE 249: n'harm s'long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off,
LINE 250: throw it back as far as you can int'the sea, and then g'away again."
LINE 251: With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived
LINE 252: down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.
LINE 253: But Ulysses did not know what t'think. "Alas," he said t'himself in
LINE 254: his dismay, "this is only some one or other of the gods wh'is luring
LINE 255: me t'ruin by advising me t'quit my raft. At any rate I will not d'so
LINE 256: at present, for the land where she said I should be quit of all
LINE 257: troubles seemed t'be still a good way off. I know what I will do—I am
LINE 258: sure it will be best—n'matter what happens I will stick t'the raft as
LINE 259: long as her timbers hold together, but when the sea breaks her up I
LINE 260: will swim for it; I d'not see how I can d'any better than this."
LINE 261: While he was thus in tw'minds, Neptune sent a terrible great wave that
LINE 262: seemed t'rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,
LINE 263: which then went t'pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed
LINE 264: about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it
LINE 265: as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calyps'had
LINE 266: given him, bound Ino's veil under his arms, and plunged int'the
LINE 267: sea—meaning t'swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,
LINE 268: and wagged his head, muttering t'himself and saying, "There now, swim
LINE 269: up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-d'people. I
LINE 270: d'not think you will be able t'say that I have let you off too
LINE 271: lightly." On this he lashed his horses and drove t'Aegae where his
LINE 272: palace is.
LINE 273: But Minerva resolved t'help Ulysses, s'she bound the ways of all the
LINE 274: winds except one, and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good
LINE 275: stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses
LINE 276: reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.
LINE 277: Thereon he floated about for tw'nights and tw'days in the water, with
LINE 278: a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when
LINE 279: the third day broke, the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so
LINE 280: much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked
LINE 281: eagerly ahead, and could see land quite near. Then, as children rejoice
LINE 282: when their dear father begins t'get better after having for a long
LINE 283: time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit, but the gods
LINE 284: deliver him from evil, s'was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land
LINE 285: and trees, and swam on with all his strength that he might once more
LINE 286: set foot upon dry ground. When, however, he got within earshot, he
LINE 287: began t'hear the surf thundering up against the rocks, for the swell
LINE 288: still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped
LINE 289: in spray; there were n'harbours where a ship might ride, nor shelter
LINE 290: of any kind, but only headlands, low-lying rocks, and mountain tops.
LINE 291: Ulysses' heart now began t'fail him, and he said despairingly to
LINE 292: himself, "Alas, Jove has let me see land after swimming s'far that I
LINE 293: had given up all hope, but I can find n'landing place, for the coast
LINE 294: is rocky and surf-beaten, the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the
LINE 295: sea, with deep water close under them s'that I cannot climb out for
LINE 296: want of foot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs
LINE 297: and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water—which would give me
LINE 298: a sorry landing. If, on the other hand, I swim further in search of
LINE 299: some shelving beach or harbour, a hurricane may carry me out t'sea
LINE 300: again sorely against my will, or heaven may send some great monster of
LINE 301: the deep t'attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such, and I know that
LINE 302: Neptune is very angry with me."
LINE 303: While he was thus in tw'minds a wave caught him and took him with such
LINE 304: force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to
LINE 305: pieces if Minerva had not shown him what t'do. He caught hold of the
LINE 306: rock with both hands and clung t'it groaning with pain till the wave
LINE 307: retired, s'he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on
LINE 308: again and carried him back with it far int'the sea—tearing his hands
LINE 309: as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its
LINE 310: bed, and the stones come up along with it—even s'did the rocks tear
LINE 311: the skin from his strong hands, and then the wave drew him deep down
LINE 312: under the water.
LINE 313: Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his
LINE 314: own destiny, if Minerva had not helped him t'keep his wits about him.
LINE 315: He swam seaward again, beyond reach of the surf that was beating
LINE 316: against the land, and at the same time he kept looking towards the
LINE 317: shore t'see if he could find some haven, or a spit that should take
LINE 318: the waves aslant. By and by, as he swam on, he came t'the mouth of a
LINE 319: river, and here he thought would be the best place, for there were no
LINE 320: rocks, and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a
LINE 321: current, s'he prayed inwardly and said:
LINE 322: "Hear me, 'King, whoever you may be, and save me from the anger of the
LINE 323: sea-god Neptune, for I approach you prayerfully. Any one wh'has lost
LINE 324: his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods, wherefore in my
LINE 325: distress I draw near t'your stream, and cling t'the knees of your
LINE 326: riverhood. Have mercy upon me, 'king, for I declare myself your
LINE 327: suppliant."
LINE 328: Then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves, making all calm
LINE 329: before him, and bringing him safely int'the mouth of the river. Here
LINE 330: at last Ulysses' knees and strong hands failed him, for the sea had
LINE 331: completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and
LINE 332: nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, s'that he could neither
LINE 333: breathe nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,
LINE 334: when he had got his breath and came t'himself again, he took off the
LINE 335: scarf that In'had given him and threw it back int'the salt54 stream
LINE 336: of the river, whereon In'received it int'her hands from the wave that
LINE 337: bore it towards her. Then he left the river, laid himself down among
LINE 338: the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.
LINE 339: "Alas," he cried t'himself in his dismay, "what ever will become of
LINE 340: me, and how is it all t'end? If I stay here upon the river bed through
LINE 341: the long watches of the night, I am s'exhausted that the bitter cold
LINE 342: and damp may make an end of me—for towards sunrise there will be a keen
LINE 343: wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the
LINE 344: hill side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may
LINE 345: escape the cold and have a good night's rest, but some savage beast may
LINE 346: take advantage of me and devour me."
