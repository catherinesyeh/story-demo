LINE 1: THE KILLING OF THE SUITORS—THE MAIDS WH'HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES
LINE 2: ARE MADE T'CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.
LINE 3: Then Ulysses tore off his rags, and sprang on t'the broad pavement
LINE 4: with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to
LINE 5: the ground at his feet and said, "The mighty contest is at an end. I
LINE 6: will now see whether Apoll'will vouchsafe it t'me t'hit another mark
LINE 7: which n'man has yet hit."
LINE 8: On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous, wh'was about t'take up a
LINE 9: two-handled gold cup t'drink his wine and already had it in his hands.
LINE 10: He had n'thought of death—wh'amongst all the revellers would think
LINE 11: that one man, however brave, would stand alone among s'many and kill
LINE 12: him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat, and the point went clean
LINE 13: through his neck, s'that he fell over and the cup dropped from his
LINE 14: hand, while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked
LINE 15: the table from him and upset the things on it, s'that the bread and
LINE 16: roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on t'the ground.166
LINE 17: The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit;
LINE 18: they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked
LINE 19: everywhere towards the walls, but there was neither shield nor spear,
LINE 20: and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. "Stranger," said they, "you
LINE 21: shall pay for shooting people in this way: you shall see n'other
LINE 22: contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was the foremost
LINE 23: youth in Ithaca, and the vultures shall devour you for having killed
LINE 24: him."
LINE 25: Thus they spoke, for they thought that he had killed Antinous by
LINE 26: mistake, and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of
LINE 27: every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:
LINE 28: "Dogs, did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have
LINE 29: wasted my substance,167 have forced my women servants t'lie with you,
LINE 30: and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared
LINE 31: neither God nor man, and now you shall die."
LINE 32: They turned pale with fear as he spoke, and every man looked round
LINE 33: about t'see whither he might fly for safety, but Eurymachus alone
LINE 34: spoke.
LINE 35: "If you are Ulysses," said he, "then what you have said is just. We
LINE 36: have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who
LINE 37: was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all
LINE 38: his doing. It was not that he wanted t'marry Penelope; he did not so
LINE 39: much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different, and
LINE 40: Jove has not vouchsafed it t'him; he wanted t'kill your son and t'be
LINE 41: chief man in Ithaca. Now, therefore, that he has met the death which
LINE 42: was his due, spare the lives of your people. We will make everything
LINE 43: good among ourselves, and pay you in full for all that we have eaten
LINE 44: and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen, and
LINE 45: we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened.
LINE 46: Until we have done this n'one can complain of your being enraged
LINE 47: against us."
LINE 48: Ulysses again glared at him and said, "Though you should give me all
LINE 49: that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have, I
LINE 50: will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must
LINE 51: fight, or fly for your lives; and fly, not a man of you shall."
LINE 52: Their hearts sank as they heard him, but Eurymachus again spoke saying:
LINE 53: "My friends, this man will give us n'quarter. He will stand where he
LINE 54: is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then
LINE 55: show fight; draw your swords, and hold up the tables t'shield you from
LINE 56: his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush, t'drive him from the
LINE 57: pavement and doorway: we can then get through int'the town, and raise
LINE 58: such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting."
LINE 59: As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze, sharpened on both sides,
LINE 60: and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses, but Ulysses instantly shot
LINE 61: an arrow int'his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself
LINE 62: in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.
LINE 63: The cup and all the meats went over on t'the ground as he smote the
LINE 64: earth with his forehead in the agonies of death, and he kicked the
LINE 65: stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.
LINE 66: Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses t'try and
LINE 67: get him away from the door; but Telemachus was to'quick for him, and
LINE 68: struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and
LINE 69: went right through his chest, s'that he fell heavily t'the ground and
LINE 70: struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from
LINE 71: him, leaving his spear still in the body, for he feared that if he
LINE 72: stayed t'draw it out, some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack
LINE 73: at him with his sword, or knock him down, s'he set off at a run, and
LINE 74: immediately was at his father's side. Then he said:
LINE 75: "Father, let me bring you a shield, tw'spears, and a brass helmet for
LINE 76: your temples. I will arm myself as well, and will bring other armour
LINE 77: for the swineherd and the stockman, for we had better be armed."
LINE 78: "Run and fetch them," answered Ulysses, "while my arrows hold out, or
LINE 79: when I am alone they may get me away from the door."
LINE 80: Telemachus did as his father said, and went off t'the store room where
LINE 81: the armour was kept. He chose four shields, eight spears, and four
LINE 82: brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to
LINE 83: his father, and armed himself first, while the stockman and the
LINE 84: swineherd als'put on their armour, and took their places near Ulysses.
LINE 85: Meanwhile Ulysses, as long as his arrows lasted, had been shooting the
LINE 86: suitors one by one, and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows
LINE 87: gave out, he set the bow t'stand against the end wall of the house by
LINE 88: the door post, and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders;
LINE 89: on his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought with a crest of
LINE 90: horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,168 and he grasped two
LINE 91: redoubtable bronze-shod spears.
LINE 92: Now there was a trap door169 on the wall, while at one end of the
LINE 93: pavement170 there was an exit leading t'a narrow passage, and this
LINE 94: exit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius t'stand
LINE 95: by this door and guard it, for only one person could attack it at a
LINE 96: time. But Agelaus shouted out, "Cannot some one g'up t'the trap door
LINE 97: and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once, and we
LINE 98: should soon make an end of this man and his shooting."
LINE 99: "This may not be, Agelaus," answered Melanthius, "the mouth of the
LINE 100: narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance t'the outer court. One
LINE 101: brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I
LINE 102: will do, I will bring you arms from the store-room, for I am sure it is
LINE 103: there that Ulysses and his son have put them."
LINE 104: On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages t'the store-room
LINE 105: of Ulysses' house. There he chose twelve shields, with as many helmets
LINE 106: and spears, and brought them back as fast as he could t'give them to
LINE 107: the suitors. Ulysses' heart began t'fail him when he saw the
LINE 108: suitors171 putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw
LINE 109: the greatness of the danger, and said t'Telemachus, "Some one of the
LINE 110: women inside is helping the suitors against us, or it may be
LINE 111: Melanthius."
LINE 112: Telemachus answered, "The fault, father, is mine, and mine only; I left
LINE 113: the store room door open, and they have kept a sharper look out than I
LINE 114: have. Go, Eumaeus, put the door to, and see whether it is one of the
LINE 115: women wh'is doing this, or whether, as I suspect, it is Melanthius the
LINE 116: son of Dolius."
LINE 117: Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going t'the
LINE 118: store room t'fetch more armour, but the swineherd saw him and said to
LINE 119: Ulysses wh'was beside him, "Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, it is that
LINE 120: scoundrel Melanthius, just as we suspected, wh'is going t'the store
LINE 121: room. Say, shall I kill him, if I can get the better of him, or shall I
LINE 122: bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many
LINE 123: wrongs that he has done in your house?"
LINE 124: Ulysses answered, "Telemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,
LINE 125: n'matter what they do; g'back both of you and bind Melanthius' hands
LINE 126: and feet behind him. Throw him int'the store room and make the door
LINE 127: fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body, and string him
LINE 128: close up t'the rafters from a high bearing-post,172 that he may linger
LINE 129: on in an agony."
LINE 130: Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said; they went t'the
LINE 131: store room, which they entered before Melanthius saw them, for he was
LINE 132: busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room, s'the two
LINE 133: took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by
LINE 134: Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand, and an old dry-rotted
LINE 135: shield in the other, which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,
LINE 136: but which had been long since thrown aside, and the straps had become
LINE 137: unsewn; on this the tw'seized him, dragged him back by the hair, and
LINE 138: threw him struggling t'the ground. They bent his hands and feet well
LINE 139: behind his back, and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses
LINE 140: had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him
LINE 141: up from a high pillar till he was close up t'the rafters, and over him
LINE 142: did you then vaunt, 'swineherd Eumaeus saying, "Melanthius, you will
LINE 143: pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well
LINE 144: when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus, and it is time for you
LINE 145: t'be driving in your goats for the suitors t'feast on."
LINE 146: There, then, they left him in very cruel bondage, and having put on
LINE 147: their armour they closed the door behind them and went back t'take
LINE 148: their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the
LINE 149: cloister, fierce and full of fury; nevertheless, those wh'were in the
LINE 150: body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove's daughter
LINE 151: Minerva came up t'them, having assumed the voice and form of Mentor.
LINE 152: Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said, "Mentor, lend me your help,
LINE 153: and forget not your old comrade, nor the many good turns he has done
LINE 154: you. Besides, you are my age-mate."
LINE 155: But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva, and the suitors from the
LINE 156: other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to
LINE 157: reproach her. "Mentor," he cried, "d'not let Ulysses beguile you into
LINE 158: siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when
LINE 159: we have killed these people, father and son, we will kill you too. You
LINE 160: shall pay for it with your head, and when we have killed you, we will
LINE 161: take all you have, in doors or out, and bring it int'hotch-pot with
LINE 162: Ulysses' property; we will not let your sons live in your house, nor
LINE 163: your daughters, nor shall your widow continue t'live in the city of
LINE 164: Ithaca."
LINE 165: This made Minerva still more furious, s'she scolded Ulysses very
LINE 166: angrily.173 "Ulysses," said she, "your strength and prowess are no
LINE 167: longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the
LINE 168: Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those
LINE 169: days, and it was through your stratagem that Priam's city was taken.
LINE 170: How comes it that you are s'lamentably less valiant now that you are
LINE 171: on your own ground, face t'face with the suitors in your own house?
LINE 172: Come on, my good fellow, stand by my side and see how Mentor, son of
LINE 173: Alcimus shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred
LINE 174: upon him."
LINE 175: But she would not give him full victory as yet, for she wished still
LINE 176: further t'prove his own prowess and that of his brave son, s'she flew
LINE 177: up t'one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in
LINE 178: the form of a swallow.
LINE 179: Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor, Eurynomus, Amphimedon, Demoptolemus,
LINE 180: Pisander, and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon
LINE 181: the suitors' side; of all those wh'were still fighting for their lives
LINE 182: they were by far the most valiant, for the others had already fallen
LINE 183: under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted t'them and said, "My
LINE 184: friends, he will soon have t'leave off, for Mentor has gone away after
LINE 185: having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors
LINE 186: unsupported. D'not aim at him all at once, but six of you throw your
LINE 187: spears first, and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by
LINE 188: killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the
LINE 189: others."
LINE 190: They threw their spears as he bade them, but Minerva made them all of
LINE 191: n'effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the
LINE 192: pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had
LINE 193: avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said t'his own men, "My
LINE 194: friends, I should say we to'had better let drive int'the middle of
LINE 195: them, or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us
LINE 196: outright."
LINE 197: They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.
LINE 198: Ulysses killed Demoptolemus, Telemachus Euryades, Eumaeus Elatus, while
LINE 199: the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust, and as the others
LINE 200: drew back int'a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained
LINE 201: their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.
LINE 202: The suitors now aimed a second time, but again Minerva made their
LINE 203: weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the
LINE 204: cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of
LINE 205: another struck the wall. Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the top
LINE 206: skin from off Telemachus's wrist, and Ctesippus managed t'graze
LINE 207: Eumaeus's shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to
LINE 208: the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive int'the crowd of
LINE 209: suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas, Telemachus Amphimedon, and Eumaeus
LINE 210: Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast, and
LINE 211: taunted him saying, "Foul-mouthed son of Polytherses, d'not be so
LINE 212: foolish as t'talk wickedly another time, but let heaven direct your
LINE 213: speech, for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present of
LINE 214: this advice t'repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he
LINE 215: was begging about in his own house."
LINE 216: Thus spoke the stockman, and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a
LINE 217: spear in close fight, while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in
LINE 218: the belly, and the dart went clean through him, s'that he fell forward
LINE 219: full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the
LINE 220: rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors quailed.
LINE 221: They fled t'the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened
LINE 222: by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest. As
LINE 223: eagle-beaked, crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on
LINE 224: the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground, and kill them,
LINE 225: for they cannot either fight or fly, and lookers on enjoy the
LINE 226: sport—even s'did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite
LINE 227: them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains were
LINE 228: being battered in, and the ground seethed with their blood.
LINE 229: Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said, "Ulysses I beseech
LINE 230: you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women
LINE 231: in your house either in word or deed, and I tried t'stop the others. I
LINE 232: saw them, but they would not listen, and now they are paying for their
LINE 233: folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me, I shall die
LINE 234: without having done anything t'deserve it, and shall have got no
LINE 235: thanks for all the good that I did."
LINE 236: Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered, "If you were their
LINE 237: sacrificing priest, you must have prayed many a time that it might be
LINE 238: long before I got home again, and that you might marry my wife and have
LINE 239: children by her. Therefore you shall die."
LINE 240: With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when
LINE 241: he was being killed, and which was lying upon the ground. Then he
LINE 242: struck Leiodes on the back of his neck, s'that his head fell rolling
LINE 243: in the dust while he was yet speaking.
LINE 244: The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes—he wh'had been forced by the
LINE 245: suitors t'sing t'them—now tried t'save his life. He was standing
LINE 246: near towards the trap door,174 and held his lyre in his hand. He did
LINE 247: not know whether t'fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar
LINE 248: of Jove that was in the outer court, and on which both Laertes and
LINE 249: Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox, or whether t'go
LINE 250: straight up t'Ulysses and embrace his knees, but in the end he deemed
LINE 251: it best t'embrace Ulysses' knees. S'he laid his lyre on the ground
LINE 252: between the mixing bowl 175 and the silver-studded seat; then going up
LINE 253: t'Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said, "Ulysses, I beseech
LINE 254: you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards
LINE 255: if you kill a bard wh'can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make
LINE 256: all my lays myself, and heaven visits me with every kind of
LINE 257: inspiration. I would sing t'you as though you were a god, d'not
LINE 258: therefore be in such a hurry t'cut my head off. Your own son
LINE 259: Telemachus will tell you that I did not want t'frequent your house and
LINE 260: sing t'the suitors after their meals, but they were to'many and too
LINE 261: strong for me, s'they made me."
LINE 262: Telemachus heard him, and at once went up t'his father. "Hold!" he
LINE 263: cried, "the man is guiltless, d'him n'hurt; and we will spare Medon
LINE 264: too, wh'was always good t'me when I was a boy, unless Philoetius or
LINE 265: Eumaeus has already killed him, or he has fallen in your way when you
LINE 266: were raging about the court."
LINE 267: Medon caught these words of Telemachus, for he was crouching under a
LINE 268: seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly
LINE 269: flayed heifer's hide, s'he threw off the hide, went up t'Telemachus,
LINE 270: and laid hold of his knees.
LINE 271: "Here I am, my dear sir," said he, "stay your hand therefore, and tell
LINE 272: your father, or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for
LINE 273: having wasted his substance and been s'foolishly disrespectful to
LINE 274: yourself."
LINE 275: Ulysses smiled at him and answered, "Fear not; Telemachus has saved
LINE 276: your life, that you may know in future, and tell other people, how
LINE 277: greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go, therefore,
LINE 278: outside the cloisters int'the outer court, and be out of the way of
LINE 279: the slaughter—you and the bard—while I finish my work here inside."
LINE 280: The pair went int'the outer court as fast as they could, and sat down
LINE 281: by Jove's great altar, looking fearfully round, and still expecting
LINE 282: that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court
LINE 283: carefully over, t'see if anyone had managed t'hide himself and was
LINE 284: still living, but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in
LINE 285: their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of
LINE 286: the sea, and thrown upon the beach t'lie gasping for water till the
LINE 287: heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even s'were the suitors lying
LINE 288: all huddled up one against the other.
LINE 289: Then Ulysses said t'Telemachus, "Call nurse Euryclea; I have something
LINE 290: t'say t'her."
LINE 291: Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women's room. "Make
LINE 292: haste," said he, "you old woman wh'have been set over all the other
LINE 293: women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes t'speak t'you."
LINE 294: When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women's room
LINE 295: and came out, following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses
LINE 296: bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been
LINE 297: devouring an ox, and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody, so
LINE 298: that he is a fearful sight; even s'was Ulysses besmirched from head to
LINE 299: foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of
LINE 300: blood, she was beginning t'cry out for joy, for she saw that a great
LINE 301: deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her, "Old woman," said he,
LINE 302: "rejoice in silence; restrain yourself, and d'not make any noise about
LINE 303: it; it is an unholy thing t'vaunt over dead men. Heaven's doom and
LINE 304: their own evil deeds have brought these men t'destruction, for they
LINE 305: respected n'man in the whole world, neither rich nor poor, wh'came
LINE 306: near them, and they have come t'a bad end as a punishment for their
LINE 307: wickedness and folly. Now, however, tell me which of the women in the
LINE 308: house have misconducted themselves, and wh'are innocent."176
LINE 309: "I will tell you the truth, my son," answered Euryclea. "There are
LINE 310: fifty women in the house whom we teach t'd'things, such as carding
LINE 311: wool, and all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all177 have
LINE 312: misbehaved, and have been wanting in respect t'me, and als'to
LINE 313: Penelope. They showed n'disrespect t'Telemachus, for he has only
LINE 314: lately grown and his mother never permitted him t'give orders t'the
LINE 315: female servants; but let me g'upstairs and tell your wife all that has
LINE 316: happened, for some god has been sending her t'sleep."
LINE 317: "D'not wake her yet," answered Ulysses, "but tell the women wh'have
LINE 318: misconducted themselves t'come t'me."
LINE 319: Euryclea left the cloister t'tell the women, and make them come to
LINE 320: Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus, the stockman, and the
LINE 321: swineherd. "Begin," said he, "t'remove the dead, and make the women
LINE 322: help you. Then, get sponges and clean water t'swill down the tables
LINE 323: and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take
LINE 324: the women int'the space between the domed room and the wall of the
LINE 325: outer court, and run them through with your swords till they are quite
LINE 326: dead, and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used
LINE 327: t'lie in secret with the suitors."
LINE 328: On this the women came down in a body, weeping and wailing bitterly.
LINE 329: First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them up against one
LINE 330: another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do
LINE 331: their work quickly, s'they had t'carry the bodies out. When they had
LINE 332: done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and
LINE 333: water, while Telemachus and the tw'others shovelled up the blood and
LINE 334: dirt from the ground, and the women carried it all away and put it out
LINE 335: of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and
LINE 336: orderly, they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space
LINE 337: between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard, s'that they
LINE 338: could not get away: and Telemachus said t'the other two, "I shall not
LINE 339: let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent t'me and my
LINE 340: mother, and used t'sleep with the suitors."
LINE 341: S'saying he made a ship's cable fast t'one of the bearing-posts that
LINE 342: supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all around the
LINE 343: building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should touch
LINE 344: the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been
LINE 345: set for them in a thicket just as they were getting t'their nest, and
LINE 346: a terrible fate awaits them, even s'did the women have t'put their
LINE 347: heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.178 Their
LINE 348: feet moved convulsively for a while, but not for very long.
LINE 349: As for Melanthius, they took him through the cloister int'the inner
LINE 350: court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his
