LINE 1: PENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND—EARLY IN THE MORNING
LINE 2: ULYSSES, TELEMACHUS, EUMAEUS, AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.
LINE 3: Euryclea now went upstairs laughing t'tell her mistress that her dear
LINE 4: husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet
LINE 5: were nimble for joy as she went up t'her mistress and bent over her
LINE 6: head t'speak t'her. "Wake up Penelope, my dear child," she exclaimed,
LINE 7: "and see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this
LINE 8: long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again, and has
LINE 9: killed the suitors wh'were giving s'much trouble in his house, eating
LINE 10: up his estate and ill treating his son."
LINE 11: "My good nurse," answered Penelope, "you must be mad. The gods
LINE 12: sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds, and make
LINE 13: foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing
LINE 14: t'you; for you always used t'be a reasonable person. Why should you
LINE 15: thus mock me when I have trouble enough already—talking such nonsense,
LINE 16: and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my
LINE 17: eyes and closed them? I have never slept s'soundly from the day my
LINE 18: poor husband went t'that city with the ill-omened name. G'back again
LINE 19: int'the women's room; if it had been any one else wh'had woke me up
LINE 20: t'bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe
LINE 21: scolding. As it is your age shall protect you."
LINE 22: "My dear child," answered Euryclea, "I am not mocking you. It is quite
LINE 23: true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger
LINE 24: whom they all kept on treating s'badly in the cloister. Telemachus
LINE 25: knew all the time that he was come back, but kept his father's secret
LINE 26: that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people."
LINE 27: Then Penelope sprang up from her couch, threw her arms round Euryclea,
LINE 28: and wept for joy. "But my dear nurse," said she, "explain this t'me;
LINE 29: if he has really come home as you say, how did he manage t'overcome
LINE 30: the wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there
LINE 31: always were?"
LINE 32: "I was not there," answered Euryclea, "and d'not know; I only heard
LINE 33: them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and
LINE 34: huddled up in a corner of the women's room with the doors closed, till
LINE 35: your son came t'fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found
LINE 36: Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all
LINE 37: round him, one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you
LINE 38: could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and
LINE 39: filth, and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled
LINE 40: up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court, and Ulysses has lit a
LINE 41: great fire t'purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me t'call
LINE 42: you, s'come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for
LINE 43: now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband
LINE 44: is come home t'find both wife and son alive and well, and t'take his
LINE 45: revenge in his own house on the suitors wh'behaved s'badly t'him."
LINE 46: "My dear nurse," said Penelope, "d'not exult to'confidently over all
LINE 47: this. You know how delighted every one would be t'see Ulysses come
LINE 48: home—more particularly myself, and the son wh'has been born t'both of
LINE 49: us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god wh'is
LINE 50: angry with the suitors for their great wickedness, and has made an end
LINE 51: of them; for they respected n'man in the whole world, neither rich nor
LINE 52: poor, wh'came near them, and they have come t'a bad end in
LINE 53: consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away from the
LINE 54: Achaean land; he will never return home again."
LINE 55: Then nurse Euryclea said, "My child, what are you talking about? but
LINE 56: you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your
LINE 57: husband is never coming, although he is in the house and by his own
LINE 58: fire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;
LINE 59: when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave
LINE 60: him, and I wanted t'tell you about it, but in his wisdom he would not
LINE 61: let me, and clapped his hands over my mouth; s'come with me and I will
LINE 62: make this bargain with you—if I am deceiving you, you may have me
LINE 63: killed by the most cruel death you can think of."
LINE 64: "My dear nurse," said Penelope, "however wise you may be you can hardly
LINE 65: fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless, we will g'in search of
LINE 66: my son, that I may see the corpses of the suitors, and the man wh'has
LINE 67: killed them."
LINE 68: On this she came down from her upper room, and while doing s'she
LINE 69: considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and
LINE 70: question him, or whether she should at once g'up t'him and embrace
LINE 71: him. When, however, she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,
LINE 72: she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire, against the wall at right
LINE 73: angles180 [t'that by which she had entered], while Ulysses sat near
LINE 74: one of the bearing-posts, looking upon the ground, and waiting t'see
LINE 75: what his brave wife would say t'him when she saw him. For a long time
LINE 76: she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked
LINE 77: him full in the face, but then again directly, she was misled by his
LINE 78: shabby clothes and failed t'recognise him,181 till Telemachus began to
LINE 79: reproach her and said:
LINE 80: "Mother—but you are s'hard that I cannot call you by such a name—why
LINE 81: d'you keep away from my father in this way? Why d'you not sit by his
LINE 82: side and begin talking t'him and asking him questions? N'other woman
LINE 83: could bear t'keep away from her husband when he had come back t'her
LINE 84: after twenty years of absence, and after having gone through s'much;
LINE 85: but your heart always was as hard as a stone."
LINE 86: Penelope answered, "My son, I am s'lost in astonishment that I can
LINE 87: find n'words in which either t'ask questions or t'answer them. I
LINE 88: cannot even look him straight in the face. Still, if he really is
LINE 89: Ulysses come back t'his own home again, we shall get t'understand one
LINE 90: another better by and by, for there are tokens with which we tw'are
LINE 91: alone acquainted, and which are hidden from all others."
LINE 92: Ulysses smiled at this, and said t'Telemachus, "Let your mother put me
LINE 93: t'any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.
LINE 94: She rejects me for the moment and believes me t'be somebody else,
LINE 95: because I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,
LINE 96: however, consider what we had better d'next. When one man has killed
LINE 97: another—even though he was not one wh'would leave many friends t'take
LINE 98: up his quarrel—the man wh'has killed him must still say good bye to
LINE 99: his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay
LINE 100: of a whole town, and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you
LINE 101: consider this matter."
LINE 102: "Look t'it yourself, father," answered Telemachus, "for they say you
LINE 103: are the wisest counsellor in the world, and that there is n'other
LINE 104: mortal man wh'can compare with you. We will follow you with right good
LINE 105: will, nor shall you find us fail you in s'far as our strength holds
LINE 106: out."
LINE 107: "I will say what I think will be best," answered Ulysses. "First wash
LINE 108: and put your shirts on; tell the maids als't'g't'their own room and
LINE 109: dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre, s'that
LINE 110: if people outside hear, or any of the neighbours, or some one going
LINE 111: along the street happens t'notice it, they may think there is a
LINE 112: wedding in the house, and n'rumours about the death of the suitors
LINE 113: will get about in the town, before we can escape t'the woods upon my
LINE 114: own land. Once there, we will settle which of the courses heaven
LINE 115: vouchsafes us shall seem wisest."
LINE 116: Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had said. First they washed
LINE 117: and put their shirts on, while the women got ready. Then Phemius took
LINE 118: his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The
LINE 119: house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing, and the people
LINE 120: outside said, "I suppose the queen has been getting married at last.
LINE 121: She ought t'be ashamed of herself for not continuing t'protect her
LINE 122: husband's property until he comes home."182
LINE 123: This was what they said, but they did not know what it was that had
LINE 124: been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses
LINE 125: in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak, while Minerva made him
LINE 126: look taller and stronger than before; she als'made the hair grow thick
LINE 127: on the top of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;
LINE 128: she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful
LINE 129: workman wh'has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva—and
LINE 130: his work is full of beauty—enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding
LINE 131: it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals, and sat
LINE 132: down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. "My dear," said he,
LINE 133: "heaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever
LINE 134: yet had. N'other woman could bear t'keep away from her husband when
LINE 135: he had come back t'her after twenty years of absence, and after having
LINE 136: gone through s'much. But come, nurse, get a bed ready for me; I will
LINE 137: sleep alone, for this woman has a heart as hard as iron."
LINE 138: "My dear," answered Penelope, "I have n'wish t'set myself up, nor to
LINE 139: depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance, for I very well
LINE 140: remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.
LINE 141: Nevertheless, Euryclea, take his bed outside the bed chamber that he
LINE 142: himself built. Bring the bed outside this room, and put bedding upon it
LINE 143: with fleeces, good coverlets, and blankets."
LINE 144: She said this t'try him, but Ulysses was very angry and said, "Wife, I
LINE 145: am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Wh'has been
LINE 146: taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it
LINE 147: a hard task, n'matter how skilled a workman he was, unless some god
LINE 148: came and helped him t'shift it. There is n'man living, however strong
LINE 149: and in his prime, wh'could move it from its place, for it is a
LINE 150: marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a
LINE 151: young olive growing within the precincts of the house, in full vigour,
LINE 152: and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with
LINE 153: strong walls of stone and a roof t'cover them, and I made the doors
LINE 154: strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive
LINE 155: tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root
LINE 156: upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skilfully,
LINE 157: straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into
LINE 158: a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the
LINE 159: centre-post of my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it,
LINE 160: inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of
LINE 161: crimson leather from one side of it t'the other. S'you see I know all
LINE 162: about it, and I desire t'learn whether it is still there, or whether
LINE 163: any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its
LINE 164: roots."
LINE 165: When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her, she fairly broke
LINE 166: down. She flew weeping t'his side, flung her arms about his neck, and
LINE 167: kissed him. "D'not be angry with me Ulysses," she cried, "you, wh'are
LINE 168: the wisest of mankind. We have suffered, both of us. Heaven has denied
LINE 169: us the happiness of spending our youth, and of growing old, together;
LINE 170: d'not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you
LINE 171: thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through
LINE 172: fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story;
LINE 173: for there are many very wicked people going about. Jove's daughter
LINE 174: Helen would never have yielded herself t'a man from a foreign country,
LINE 175: if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and
LINE 176: bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart t'd'wrong, and she gave no
LINE 177: thought t'that sin, which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now,
LINE 178: however, that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about
LINE 179: our bed (which n'human being has ever seen but you and I and a single
LINE 180: maidservant, the daughter of Actor, wh'was given me by my father on my
LINE 181: marriage, and wh'keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I
LINE 182: have been I can mistrust n'longer."
LINE 183: Then Ulysses in his turn melted, and wept as he clasped his dear and
LINE 184: faithful wife t'his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome t'men who
LINE 185: are swimming towards the shore, when Neptune has wrecked their ship
LINE 186: with the fury of his winds and waves; a few alone reach the land, and
LINE 187: these, covered with brine, are thankful when they find themselves on
LINE 188: firm ground and out of danger—even s'was her husband welcome t'her as
LINE 189: she looked upon him, and she could not tear her tw'fair arms from
LINE 190: about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow
LINE 191: till rosy-fingered morn appeared, had not Minerva determined otherwise,
LINE 192: and held night back in the far west, while she would not suffer Dawn to
LINE 193: leave Oceanus, nor t'yoke the tw'steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear
LINE 194: her onward t'break the day upon mankind.
LINE 195: At last, however, Ulysses said, "Wife, we have not yet reached the end
LINE 196: of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still t'undergo. It
LINE 197: is long and difficult, but I must g'through with it, for thus the
LINE 198: shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me, on the day when I went
LINE 199: down int'Hades t'ask about my return and that of my companions. But
LINE 200: now let us g't'bed, that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon
LINE 201: of sleep."
LINE 202: "You shall g't'bed as soon as you please," replied Penelope, "now
LINE 203: that the gods have sent you home t'your own good house and t'your
LINE 204: country. But as heaven has put it in your mind t'speak of it, tell me
LINE 205: about the task that lies before you. I shall have t'hear about it
LINE 206: later, s'it is better that I should be told at once."
LINE 207: "My dear," answered Ulysses, "why should you press me t'tell you?
LINE 208: Still, I will not conceal it from you, though you will not like it. I
LINE 209: d'not like it myself, for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,
LINE 210: carrying an oar, till I came t'a country where the people have never
LINE 211: heard of the sea, and d'not even mix salt with their food. They know
LINE 212: nothing about ships, nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave
LINE 213: me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a
LINE 214: wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel
LINE 215: that I had on my shoulder. On this, I was t'fix my oar in the ground
LINE 216: and sacrifice a ram, a bull, and a boar t'Neptune; after which I was
LINE 217: t'g'home and offer hecatombs t'all the gods in heaven, one after the
LINE 218: other. As for myself, he said that death should come t'me from the
LINE 219: sea, and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of
LINE 220: years and peace of mind, and my people should bless me. All this, he
LINE 221: said, should surely come t'pass."
LINE 222: And Penelope said, "If the gods are going t'vouchsafe you a happier
LINE 223: time in your old age, you may hope then t'have some respite from
LINE 224: misfortune."
LINE 225: Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches
LINE 226: and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid
LINE 227: them, the nurse went back int'the house t'g't'her rest, leaving the
LINE 228: bed chamber woman Eurynome183 t'show Ulysses and Penelope t'bed by
LINE 229: torch light. When she had conducted them t'their room she went back,
LINE 230: and they then came joyfully t'the rites of their own old bed.
LINE 231: Telemachus, Philoetius, and the swineherd now left off dancing, and
LINE 232: made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down t'sleep
LINE 233: in the cloisters.
LINE 234: When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking
LINE 235: with one another. She told him how much she had had t'bear in seeing
LINE 236: the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors wh'had killed s'many
LINE 237: sheep and oxen on her account, and had drunk s'many casks of wine.
LINE 238: Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered, and how much trouble
LINE 239: he had himself given t'other people. He told her everything, and she
LINE 240: was s'delighted t'listen that she never went t'sleep till he had
LINE 241: ended his whole story.
LINE 242: He began with his victory over the Cicons, and how he thence reached
LINE 243: the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops
LINE 244: and how he had punished him for having s'ruthlessly eaten his brave
LINE 245: comrades; how he then went on t'Aeolus, wh'received him hospitably
LINE 246: and furthered him on his way, but even s'he was not t'reach home, for
LINE 247: t'his great grief a hurricane carried him out t'sea again; how he
LINE 248: went on t'the Laestrygonian city Telepylos, where the people destroyed
LINE 249: all his ships with their crews, save himself and his own ship only.
LINE 250: Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft, and how he sailed t'the
LINE 251: chill house of Hades, t'consult the ghost of the Theban prophet
LINE 252: Teiresias, and how he saw his old comrades in arms, and his mother who
LINE 253: bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the
LINE 254: wondrous singing of the Sirens, and went on t'the wandering rocks and
LINE 255: terrible Charybdis and t'Scylla, whom n'man had ever yet passed in
LINE 256: safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god, and how Jove
LINE 257: therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts, s'that all his men
LINE 258: perished together, himself alone being left alive; how at last he
LINE 259: reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso, wh'kept him there in
LINE 260: a cave, and fed him, and wanted him t'marry her, in which case she
LINE 261: intended making him immortal s'that he should never grow old, but she
LINE 262: could not persuade him t'let her d'so; and how after much suffering
LINE 263: he had found his way t'the Phaeacians, wh'had treated him as though
LINE 264: he had been a god, and sent him back in a ship t'his own country after
LINE 265: having given him gold, bronze, and raiment in great abundance. This was
LINE 266: the last thing about which he told her, for here a deep sleep took hold
LINE 267: upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.
LINE 268: Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that
LINE 269: Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose, she bade gold-enthroned
LINE 270: Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On
LINE 271: this, Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said t'Penelope,
LINE 272: "Wife, we have both of us had our full share of troubles, you, here, in
LINE 273: lamenting my absence, and I in being prevented from getting home though
LINE 274: I was longing all the time t'd'so. Now, however, that we have at last
LINE 275: come together, take care of the property that is in the house. As for
LINE 276: the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten, I will take
LINE 277: many myself by force from other people, and will compel the Achaeans to
LINE 278: make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now
LINE 279: going t'the wooded lands out in the country t'see my father wh'has
LINE 280: s'long been grieved on my account, and t'yourself I will give these
LINE 281: instructions, though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will
LINE 282: at once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; g'upstairs,
LINE 283: therefore,184 and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no
LINE 284: questions."185
LINE 285: As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,
LINE 286: Philoetius, and Eumaeus, and told them all t'put on their armour also.
LINE 287: This they did, and armed themselves. When they had done so, they opened
LINE 288: the gates and sallied forth, Ulysses leading the way. It was now
LINE 289: daylight, but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led
LINE 290: them quickly out of the town.
