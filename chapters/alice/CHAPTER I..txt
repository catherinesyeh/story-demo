LINE 1: Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
LINE 2: bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
LINE 3: the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
LINE 4: conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice
LINE 5: "without pictures or conversations?"
LINE 6: So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
LINE 7: hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
LINE 8: making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
LINE 9: picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
LINE 10: close by her.
LINE 11: There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it
LINE 12: so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, "Oh
LINE 13: dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!" (when she thought it over afterwards,
LINE 14: it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
LINE 15: time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
LINE 16: watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
LINE 17: on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
LINE 18: had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
LINE 19: watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
LINE 20: field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
LINE 21: large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
LINE 22: In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
LINE 23: in the world she was to get out again.
LINE 24: The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
LINE 25: dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
LINE 26: about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
LINE 27: deep well.
LINE 28: Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
LINE 29: plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
LINE 30: was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
LINE 31: what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
LINE 32: looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
LINE 33: cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
LINE 34: hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
LINE 35: passed; it was labelled "ORANGE MARMALADE", but to her great
LINE 36: disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
LINE 37: of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
LINE 38: cupboards as she fell past it.
LINE 39: "Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall
LINE 40: think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me
LINE 41: at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the
LINE 42: top of the house!" (Which was very likely true.)
LINE 43: Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? "I wonder how
LINE 44: many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud. "I must be
LINE 45: getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
LINE 46: be four thousand miles down, I think—" (for, you see, Alice had learnt
LINE 47: several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
LINE 48: though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her
LINE 49: knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
LINE 50: practice to say it over) "—yes, that's about the right distance—but
LINE 51: then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" (Alice had no
LINE 52: idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice
LINE 53: grand words to say.)
LINE 54: Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall right _through_
LINE 55: the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk
LINE 56: with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—" (she was rather
LINE 57: glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all
LINE 58: the right word) "—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
LINE 59: country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"
LINE 60: (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you're
LINE 61: falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) "And what
LINE 62: an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do
LINE 63: to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."
LINE 64: Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
LINE 65: talking again. "Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"
LINE 66: (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at
LINE 67: tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
LINE 68: no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's
LINE 69: very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here
LINE 70: Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
LINE 71: dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" and
LINE 72: sometimes, "Do bats eat cats?" for, you see, as she couldn't answer
LINE 73: either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt
LINE 74: that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
LINE 75: walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
LINE 76: "Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly,
LINE 77: thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
LINE 78: the fall was over.
LINE 79: Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
LINE 80: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
LINE 81: long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
LINE 82: it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,
LINE 83: and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, "Oh my ears
LINE 84: and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was close behind it when she
LINE 85: turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
LINE 86: herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
LINE 87: from the roof.
LINE 88: There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
LINE 89: Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
LINE 90: door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
LINE 91: get out again.
LINE 92: Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
LINE 93: glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's
LINE 94: first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
LINE 95: but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
LINE 96: but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
LINE 97: time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
LINE 98: behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
LINE 99: little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
LINE 100: Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
LINE 101: much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
LINE 102: passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
LINE 103: out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
LINE 104: flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
LINE 105: through the doorway; "and even if my head would go through," thought
LINE 106: poor Alice, "it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
LINE 107: how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only
LINE 108: knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
LINE 109: happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things
LINE 110: indeed were really impossible.
LINE 111: There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
LINE 112: back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
LINE 113: any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
LINE 114: time she found a little bottle on it, ("which certainly was not here
LINE 115: before," said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
LINE 116: label, with the words "DRINK ME," beautifully printed on it in large
LINE 117: letters.
LINE 118: It was all very well to say "Drink me," but the wise little Alice was
LINE 119: not going to do _that_ in a hurry. "No, I'll look first," she said,
LINE 120: "and see whether it's marked '_poison_' or not"; for she had read
LINE 121: several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
LINE 122: eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
LINE 123: _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
LINE 124: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
LINE 125: and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually
LINE 126: bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
LINE 127: bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you,
LINE 128: sooner or later.
LINE 129: However, this bottle was _not_ marked "poison," so Alice ventured to
LINE 130: taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
LINE 131: flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
LINE 132: hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
LINE 133: * * * * * * *
LINE 134: * * * * * *
LINE 135: * * * * * * *
LINE 136: "What a curious feeling!" said Alice; "I must be shutting up like a
LINE 137: telescope."
LINE 138: And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
LINE 139: brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
LINE 140: through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
LINE 141: waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
LINE 142: she felt a little nervous about this; "for it might end, you know,"
LINE 143: said Alice to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle. I
LINE 144: wonder what I should be like then?" And she tried to fancy what the
LINE 145: flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
LINE 146: not remember ever having seen such a thing.
LINE 147: After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
LINE 148: into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the
LINE 149: door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
LINE 150: went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
LINE 151: it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
LINE 152: best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
LINE 153: and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
LINE 154: sat down and cried.
LINE 155: "Come, there's no use in crying like that!" said Alice to herself,
LINE 156: rather sharply; "I advise you to leave off this minute!" She generally
LINE 157: gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),
LINE 158: and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
LINE 159: her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
LINE 160: cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
LINE 161: for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
LINE 162: "But it's no use now," thought poor Alice, "to pretend to be two
LINE 163: people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable
LINE 164: person!"
LINE 165: Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
LINE 166: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
LINE 167: "EAT ME" were beautifully marked in currants. "Well, I'll eat it," said
LINE 168: Alice, "and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it
LINE 169: makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
LINE 170: get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!"
LINE 171: She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, "Which way? Which
LINE 172: way?", holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
LINE 173: growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
LINE 174: size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice
LINE 175: had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
LINE 176: things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
LINE 177: on in the common way.
LINE 178: So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.
