LINE 1: The Pool of Tears
LINE 2: "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that
LINE 3: for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); "now I'm
LINE 4: opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!"
LINE 5: (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
LINE 6: sight, they were getting so far off). "Oh, my poor little feet, I
LINE 7: wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm
LINE 8: sure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
LINE 9: myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be
LINE 10: kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I
LINE 11: want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every
LINE 12: Christmas."
LINE 13: And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. "They must
LINE 14: go by the carrier," she thought; "and how funny it'll seem, sending
LINE 15: presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
LINE 16: _Alice's Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with
LINE 17: Alice's love_).
LINE 18: Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!"
LINE 19: Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
LINE 20: now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
LINE 21: key and hurried off to the garden door.
LINE 22: Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
LINE 23: look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
LINE 24: hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.
LINE 25: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said Alice, "a great girl like
LINE 26: you," (she might well say this), "to go on crying in this way! Stop
LINE 27: this moment, I tell you!" But she went on all the same, shedding
LINE 28: gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
LINE 29: four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
LINE 30: After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
LINE 31: she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
LINE 32: Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
LINE 33: in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
LINE 34: great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, "Oh! the Duchess, the
LINE 35: Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!" Alice felt
LINE 36: so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
LINE 37: Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, "If you please,
LINE 38: sir—" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
LINE 39: the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
LINE 40: Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
LINE 41: kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: "Dear, dear! How
LINE 42: queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.
LINE 43: I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the
LINE 44: same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling
LINE 45: a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who
LINE 46: in the world am I? Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!" And she began
LINE 47: thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
LINE 48: herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
LINE 49: "I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such long
LINE 50: ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't
LINE 51: be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
LINE 52: very little! Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and—oh dear, how
LINE 53: puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
LINE 54: Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
LINE 55: and four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that
LINE 56: rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try
LINE 57: Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
LINE 58: Rome, and Rome—no, _that's_ all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been
LINE 59: changed for Mabel! I'll try and say '_How doth the little_—'" and she
LINE 60: crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
LINE 61: to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
LINE 62: did not come the same as they used to do:—
LINE 63: "How doth the little crocodile
LINE 64: Improve his shining tail,
LINE 65: And pour the waters of the Nile
LINE 66: On every golden scale!
LINE 67: "How cheerfully he seems to grin,
LINE 68: How neatly spread his claws,
LINE 69: And welcome little fishes in
LINE 70: With gently smiling jaws!"
LINE 71: "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor Alice, and her eyes
LINE 72: filled with tears again as she went on, "I must be Mabel after all, and
LINE 73: I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
LINE 74: no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've
LINE 75: made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be
LINE 76: no use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!'
LINE 77: I shall only look up and say 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and
LINE 78: then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down
LINE 79: here till I'm somebody else'—but, oh dear!" cried Alice, with a sudden
LINE 80: burst of tears, "I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so
LINE 81: _very_ tired of being all alone here!"
LINE 82: As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
LINE 83: that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while
LINE 84: she was talking. "How _can_ I have done that?" she thought. "I must be
LINE 85: growing small again." She got up and went to the table to measure
LINE 86: herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
LINE 87: now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
LINE 88: found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
LINE 89: dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
LINE 90: "That _was_ a narrow escape!" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the
LINE 91: sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; "and
LINE 92: now for the garden!" and she ran with all speed back to the little
LINE 93: door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
LINE 94: key was lying on the glass table as before, "and things are worse than
LINE 95: ever," thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this
LINE 96: before, never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!"
LINE 97: As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
LINE 98: splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
LINE 99: she had somehow fallen into the sea, "and in that case I can go back by
LINE 100: railway," she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in
LINE 101: her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
LINE 102: to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
LINE 103: sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
LINE 104: of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she
LINE 105: soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
LINE 106: she was nine feet high.
LINE 107: "I wish I hadn't cried so much!" said Alice, as she swam about, trying
LINE 108: to find her way out. "I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
LINE 109: being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be
LINE 110: sure! However, everything is queer to-day."
LINE 111: Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
LINE 112: off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
LINE 113: it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
LINE 114: she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
LINE 115: slipped in like herself.
LINE 116: "Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse?
LINE 117: Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very
LINE 118: likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she
LINE 119: began: "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired
LINE 120: of swimming about here, O Mouse!" (Alice thought this must be the right
LINE 121: way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
LINE 122: she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, "A mouse—of
LINE 123: a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!") The Mouse looked at her rather
LINE 124: inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
LINE 125: but it said nothing.
LINE 126: "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice; "I daresay it's
LINE 127: a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror." (For, with all
LINE 128: her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago
LINE 129: anything had happened.) So she began again: "Où est ma chatte?" which
LINE 130: was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a
LINE 131: sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
LINE 132: fright. "Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she
LINE 133: had hurt the poor animal's feelings. "I quite forgot you didn't like
LINE 134: cats."
LINE 135: "Not like cats!" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. "Would
LINE 136: _you_ like cats if you were me?"
LINE 137: "Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a soothing tone: "don't be angry
LINE 138: about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd
LINE 139: take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear
LINE 140: quiet thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
LINE 141: in the pool, "and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
LINE 142: paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to
LINE 143: nurse—and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your
LINE 144: pardon!" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all
LINE 145: over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. "We won't talk
LINE 146: about her any more if you'd rather not."
LINE 147: "We indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
LINE 148: tail. "As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always
LINE 149: _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name
LINE 150: again!"
LINE 151: "I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
LINE 152: conversation. "Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?" The Mouse did not
LINE 153: answer, so Alice went on eagerly: "There is such a nice little dog near
LINE 154: our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you
LINE 155: know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when
LINE 156: you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
LINE 157: of things—I can't remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you
LINE 158: know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says
LINE 159: it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,
LINE 160: "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" For the Mouse was swimming away
LINE 161: from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
LINE 162: pool as it went.
LINE 163: So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we
LINE 164: won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the
LINE 165: Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
LINE 166: was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low
LINE 167: trembling voice, "Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my
LINE 168: history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."
LINE 169: It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
LINE 170: birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a
LINE 171: Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice
LINE 172: led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
