LINE 1: A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
LINE 2: They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the
LINE 3: birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
LINE 4: to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
LINE 5: The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
LINE 6: consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
LINE 7: natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
LINE 8: she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
LINE 9: with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, "I am
LINE 10: older than you, and must know better;" and this Alice would not allow
LINE 11: without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to
LINE 12: tell its age, there was no more to be said.
LINE 13: At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
LINE 14: called out, "Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I'll_ soon make
LINE 15: you dry enough!" They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
LINE 16: Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
LINE 17: felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
LINE 18: "Ahem!" said the Mouse with an important air, "are you all ready? This
LINE 19: is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! 'William
LINE 20: the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
LINE 21: to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
LINE 22: accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
LINE 23: Mercia and Northumbria—'"
LINE 24: "Ugh!" said the Lory, with a shiver.
LINE 25: "I beg your pardon!" said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: "Did
LINE 26: you speak?"
LINE 27: "Not I!" said the Lory hastily.
LINE 28: "I thought you did," said the Mouse. "—I proceed. 'Edwin and Morcar,
LINE 29: the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even
LINE 30: Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—'"
LINE 31: "Found _what_?" said the Duck.
LINE 32: "Found _it_," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know
LINE 33: what 'it' means."
LINE 34: "I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a thing," said the
LINE 35: Duck: "it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
LINE 36: archbishop find?"
LINE 37: The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, "'—found
LINE 38: it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him
LINE 39: the crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence
LINE 40: of his Normans—' How are you getting on now, my dear?" it continued,
LINE 41: turning to Alice as it spoke.
LINE 42: "As wet as ever," said Alice in a melancholy tone: "it doesn't seem to
LINE 43: dry me at all."
LINE 44: "In that case," said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, "I move
LINE 45: that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
LINE 46: remedies—"
LINE 47: "Speak English!" said the Eaglet. "I don't know the meaning of half
LINE 48: those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And
LINE 49: the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
LINE 50: tittered audibly.
LINE 51: "What I was going to say," said the Dodo in an offended tone, "was,
LINE 52: that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race."
LINE 53: "What _is_ a Caucus-race?" said Alice; not that she wanted much to
LINE 54: know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to
LINE 55: speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.
LINE 56: "Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And,
LINE 57: as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will
LINE 58: tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
LINE 59: First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ("the exact
LINE 60: shape doesn't matter," it said,) and then all the party were placed
LINE 61: along the course, here and there. There was no "One, two, three, and
LINE 62: away," but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
LINE 63: liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,
LINE 64: when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
LINE 65: again, the Dodo suddenly called out "The race is over!" and they all
LINE 66: crowded round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"
LINE 67: This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
LINE 68: thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
LINE 69: forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the
LINE 70: pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo
LINE 71: said, "_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes."
LINE 72: "But who is to give the prizes?" quite a chorus of voices asked.
LINE 73: "Why, _she_, of course," said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one
LINE 74: finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
LINE 75: confused way, "Prizes! Prizes!"
LINE 76: Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
LINE 77: pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
LINE 78: not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly
LINE 79: one a-piece, all round.
LINE 80: "But she must have a prize herself, you know," said the Mouse.
LINE 81: "Of course," the Dodo replied very gravely. "What else have you got in
LINE 82: your pocket?" he went on, turning to Alice.
LINE 83: "Only a thimble," said Alice sadly.
LINE 84: "Hand it over here," said the Dodo.
LINE 85: Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly
LINE 86: presented the thimble, saying "We beg your acceptance of this elegant
LINE 87: thimble;" and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
LINE 88: cheered.
LINE 89: Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
LINE 90: that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
LINE 91: to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
LINE 92: she could.
LINE 93: The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
LINE 94: confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
LINE 95: theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
LINE 96: However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
LINE 97: begged the Mouse to tell them something more.
LINE 98: "You promised to tell me your history, you know," said Alice, "and why
LINE 99: it is you hate—C and D," she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
LINE 100: would be offended again.
LINE 101: "Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and
LINE 102: sighing.
LINE 103: "It _is_ a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking down with wonder
LINE 104: at the Mouse's tail; "but why do you call it sad?" And she kept on
LINE 105: puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
LINE 106: tale was something like this:—
LINE 107: "Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, 'Let us both
LINE 108: go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I'll take no
LINE 109: denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've
LINE 110: nothing to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a trial, dear
LINE 111: sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.'
LINE 112: 'I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: 'I'll
LINE 113: try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'"
LINE 114: "You are not attending!" said the Mouse to Alice severely. "What are
LINE 115: you thinking of?"
LINE 116: "I beg your pardon," said Alice very humbly: "you had got to the fifth
LINE 117: bend, I think?"
LINE 118: "I had _not!_" cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.
LINE 119: "A knot!" said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
LINE 120: anxiously about her. "Oh, do let me help to undo it!"
LINE 121: "I shall do nothing of the sort," said the Mouse, getting up and
LINE 122: walking away. "You insult me by talking such nonsense!"
LINE 123: "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor Alice. "But you're so easily offended,
LINE 124: you know!"
LINE 125: The Mouse only growled in reply.
LINE 126: "Please come back and finish your story!" Alice called after it; and
LINE 127: the others all joined in chorus, "Yes, please do!" but the Mouse only
LINE 128: shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.
LINE 129: "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, as soon as it was
LINE 130: quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to
LINE 131: her daughter "Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose
LINE 132: _your_ temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little
LINE 133: snappishly. "You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!"
LINE 134: "I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!" said Alice aloud,
LINE 135: addressing nobody in particular. "She'd soon fetch it back!"
LINE 136: "And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?" said the
LINE 137: Lory.
LINE 138: Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
LINE 139: "Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you
LINE 140: can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,
LINE 141: she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!"
LINE 142: This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the
LINE 143: birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very
LINE 144: carefully, remarking, "I really must be getting home; the night-air
LINE 145: doesn't suit my throat!" and a Canary called out in a trembling voice
LINE 146: to its children, "Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in
LINE 147: bed!" On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left
LINE 148: alone.
LINE 149: "I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!" she said to herself in a melancholy
LINE 150: tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
LINE 151: cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you
LINE 152: any more!" And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very
LINE 153: lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a
LINE 154: little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
LINE 155: eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was
LINE 156: coming back to finish his story.
