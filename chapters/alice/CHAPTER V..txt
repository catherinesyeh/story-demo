LINE 1: Advice from a Caterpillar
LINE 2: The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
LINE 3: silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
LINE 4: addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
LINE 5: "Who are _you?_" said the Caterpillar.
LINE 6: This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,
LINE 7: rather shyly, "I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know
LINE 8: who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been
LINE 9: changed several times since then."
LINE 10: "What do you mean by that?" said the Caterpillar sternly. "Explain
LINE 11: yourself!"
LINE 12: "I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir," said Alice, "because I'm
LINE 13: not myself, you see."
LINE 14: "I don't see," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 15: "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," Alice replied very politely,
LINE 16: "for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
LINE 17: different sizes in a day is very confusing."
LINE 18: "It isn't," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 19: "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said Alice; "but when you
LINE 20: have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then
LINE 21: after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little
LINE 22: queer, won't you?"
LINE 23: "Not a bit," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 24: "Well, perhaps your feelings may be different," said Alice; "all I know
LINE 25: is, it would feel very queer to _me_."
LINE 26: "You!" said the Caterpillar contemptuously. "Who are _you?_"
LINE 27: Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
LINE 28: Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_
LINE 29: short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, "I
LINE 30: think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first."
LINE 31: "Why?" said the Caterpillar.
LINE 32: Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any
LINE 33: good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant
LINE 34: state of mind, she turned away.
LINE 35: "Come back!" the Caterpillar called after her. "I've something
LINE 36: important to say!"
LINE 37: This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
LINE 38: "Keep your temper," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 39: "Is that all?" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
LINE 40: could.
LINE 41: "No," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 42: Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
LINE 43: and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For
LINE 44: some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
LINE 45: its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, "So you
LINE 46: think you're changed, do you?"
LINE 47: "I'm afraid I am, sir," said Alice; "I can't remember things as I
LINE 48: used—and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!"
LINE 49: "Can't remember _what_ things?" said the Caterpillar.
LINE 50: "Well, I've tried to say "How doth the little busy bee," but it all
LINE 51: came different!" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
LINE 52: "Repeat, "_You are old, Father William_,'" said the Caterpillar.
LINE 53: Alice folded her hands, and began:—
LINE 54: "You are old, Father William," the young man said,
LINE 55: "And your hair has become very white;
LINE 56: And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
LINE 57: Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
LINE 58: "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
LINE 59: "I feared it might injure the brain;
LINE 60: But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
LINE 61: Why, I do it again and again."
LINE 62: "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
LINE 63: And have grown most uncommonly fat;
LINE 64: Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
LINE 65: Pray, what is the reason of that?"
LINE 66: "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
LINE 67: "I kept all my limbs very supple
LINE 68: By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—
LINE 69: Allow me to sell you a couple?"
LINE 70: "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
LINE 71: For anything tougher than suet;
LINE 72: Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
LINE 73: Pray, how did you manage to do it?"
LINE 74: "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,
LINE 75: And argued each case with my wife;
LINE 76: And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
LINE 77: Has lasted the rest of my life."
LINE 78: "You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
LINE 79: That your eye was as steady as ever;
LINE 80: Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
LINE 81: What made you so awfully clever?"
LINE 82: "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
LINE 83: Said his father; "don't give yourself airs!
LINE 84: Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
LINE 85: Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"
LINE 86: "That is not said right," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 87: "Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid," said Alice, timidly; "some of the
LINE 88: words have got altered."
LINE 89: "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the Caterpillar decidedly,
LINE 90: and there was silence for some minutes.
LINE 91: The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
LINE 92: "What size do you want to be?" it asked.
LINE 93: "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," Alice hastily replied; "only one
LINE 94: doesn't like changing so often, you know."
LINE 95: "I _don't_ know," said the Caterpillar.
LINE 96: Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
LINE 97: before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
LINE 98: "Are you content now?" said the Caterpillar.
LINE 99: "Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't
LINE 100: mind," said Alice: "three inches is such a wretched height to be."
LINE 101: "It is a very good height indeed!" said the Caterpillar angrily,
LINE 102: rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
LINE 103: "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
LINE 104: thought of herself, "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
LINE 105: offended!"
LINE 106: "You'll get used to it in time," said the Caterpillar; and it put the
LINE 107: hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
LINE 108: This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a
LINE 109: minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
LINE 110: yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the
LINE 111: mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
LINE 112: "One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
LINE 113: grow shorter."
LINE 114: "One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_" thought Alice to
LINE 115: herself.
LINE 116: "Of the mushroom," said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
LINE 117: aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
LINE 118: Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
LINE 119: trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
LINE 120: perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at
LINE 121: last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
LINE 122: off a bit of the edge with each hand.
LINE 123: "And now which is which?" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
LINE 124: the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
LINE 125: violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!
LINE 126: She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
LINE 127: that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
LINE 128: set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed
LINE 129: so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
LINE 130: mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
LINE 131: lefthand bit.
LINE 132: * * * * * * *
LINE 133: * * * * * *
LINE 134: * * * * * * *
LINE 135: "Come, my head's free at last!" said Alice in a tone of delight, which
LINE 136: changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
LINE 137: were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
LINE 138: an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
LINE 139: sea of green leaves that lay far below her.
LINE 140: "What _can_ all that green stuff be?" said Alice. "And where _have_ my
LINE 141: shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?"
LINE 142: She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
LINE 143: except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
LINE 144: As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
LINE 145: she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
LINE 146: her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She
LINE 147: had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
LINE 148: going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
LINE 149: the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
LINE 150: hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
LINE 151: face, and was beating her violently with its wings.
LINE 152: "Serpent!" screamed the Pigeon.
LINE 153: "I'm _not_ a serpent!" said Alice indignantly. "Let me alone!"
LINE 154: "Serpent, I say again!" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued
LINE 155: tone, and added with a kind of sob, "I've tried every way, and nothing
LINE 156: seems to suit them!"
LINE 157: "I haven't the least idea what you're talking about," said Alice.
LINE 158: "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried
LINE 159: hedges," the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; "but those
LINE 160: serpents! There's no pleasing them!"
LINE 161: Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
LINE 162: saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.
LINE 163: "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs," said the Pigeon;
LINE 164: "but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I
LINE 165: haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!"
LINE 166: "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said Alice, who was beginning to
LINE 167: see its meaning.
LINE 168: "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," continued the
LINE 169: Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, "and just as I was thinking I
LINE 170: should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
LINE 171: from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!"
LINE 172: "But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!" said Alice. "I'm a—I'm a—"
LINE 173: "Well! _What_ are you?" said the Pigeon. "I can see you're trying to
LINE 174: invent something!"
LINE 175: "I—I'm a little girl," said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
LINE 176: the number of changes she had gone through that day.
LINE 177: "A likely story indeed!" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest
LINE 178: contempt. "I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
LINE 179: _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's
LINE 180: no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never
LINE 181: tasted an egg!"
LINE 182: "I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly," said Alice, who was a very truthful
LINE 183: child; "but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
LINE 184: know."
LINE 185: "I don't believe it," said the Pigeon; "but if they do, why then
LINE 186: they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say."
LINE 187: This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a
LINE 188: minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, "You're
LINE 189: looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to
LINE 190: me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?"
LINE 191: "It matters a good deal to _me_," said Alice hastily; "but I'm not
LINE 192: looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want
LINE 193: _yours_: I don't like them raw."
LINE 194: "Well, be off, then!" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
LINE 195: down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well
LINE 196: as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
LINE 197: and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while
LINE 198: she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
LINE 199: and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
LINE 200: the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
LINE 201: she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.
LINE 202: It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
LINE 203: felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
LINE 204: and began talking to herself, as usual. "Come, there's half my plan
LINE 205: done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm
LINE 206: going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my
LINE 207: right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how
LINE 208: _is_ that to be done, I wonder?" As she said this, she came suddenly
LINE 209: upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
LINE 210: "Whoever lives there," thought Alice, "it'll never do to come upon them
LINE 211: _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!" So she
LINE 212: began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
LINE 213: near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
