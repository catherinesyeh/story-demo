LINE 1: A Mad Tea-Party
LINE 2: There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
LINE 3: March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting
LINE 4: between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
LINE 5: cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. "Very
LINE 6: uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as it's asleep,
LINE 7: I suppose it doesn't mind."
LINE 8: The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
LINE 9: one corner of it: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw
LINE 10: Alice coming. "There's _plenty_ of room!" said Alice indignantly, and
LINE 11: she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
LINE 12: "Have some wine," the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
LINE 13: Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
LINE 14: "I don't see any wine," she remarked.
LINE 15: "There isn't any," said the March Hare.
LINE 16: "Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," said Alice angrily.
LINE 17: "It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited," said
LINE 18: the March Hare.
LINE 19: "I didn't know it was _your_ table," said Alice; "it's laid for a great
LINE 20: many more than three."
LINE 21: "Your hair wants cutting," said the Hatter. He had been looking at
LINE 22: Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
LINE 23: speech.
LINE 24: "You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with some
LINE 25: severity; "it's very rude."
LINE 26: The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_
LINE 27: was, "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"
LINE 28: "Come, we shall have some fun now!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they've
LINE 29: begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that," she added aloud.
LINE 30: "Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?" said
LINE 31: the March Hare.
LINE 32: "Exactly so," said Alice.
LINE 33: "Then you should say what you mean," the March Hare went on.
LINE 34: "I do," Alice hastily replied; "at least—at least I mean what I
LINE 35: say—that's the same thing, you know."
LINE 36: "Not the same thing a bit!" said the Hatter. "You might just as well
LINE 37: say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!"
LINE 38: "You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that 'I like what
LINE 39: I get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!"
LINE 40: "You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, who seemed to be
LINE 41: talking in his sleep, "that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing
LINE 42: as 'I sleep when I breathe'!"
LINE 43: "It _is_ the same thing with you," said the Hatter, and here the
LINE 44: conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
LINE 45: Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
LINE 46: writing-desks, which wasn't much.
LINE 47: The Hatter was the first to break the silence. "What day of the month
LINE 48: is it?" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
LINE 49: pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
LINE 50: and holding it to his ear.
LINE 51: Alice considered a little, and then said "The fourth."
LINE 52: "Two days wrong!" sighed the Hatter. "I told you butter wouldn't suit
LINE 53: the works!" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.
LINE 54: "It was the _best_ butter," the March Hare meekly replied.
LINE 55: "Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well," the Hatter grumbled:
LINE 56: "you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife."
LINE 57: The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
LINE 58: it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
LINE 59: nothing better to say than his first remark, "It was the _best_ butter,
LINE 60: you know."
LINE 61: Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. "What a
LINE 62: funny watch!" she remarked. "It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
LINE 63: tell what o'clock it is!"
LINE 64: "Why should it?" muttered the Hatter. "Does _your_ watch tell you what
LINE 65: year it is?"
LINE 66: "Of course not," Alice replied very readily: "but that's because it
LINE 67: stays the same year for such a long time together."
LINE 68: "Which is just the case with _mine_," said the Hatter.
LINE 69: Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no
LINE 70: sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. "I don't quite
LINE 71: understand you," she said, as politely as she could.
LINE 72: "The Dormouse is asleep again," said the Hatter, and he poured a little
LINE 73: hot tea upon its nose.
LINE 74: The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
LINE 75: eyes, "Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself."
LINE 76: "Have you guessed the riddle yet?" the Hatter said, turning to Alice
LINE 77: again.
LINE 78: "No, I give it up," Alice replied: "what's the answer?"
LINE 79: "I haven't the slightest idea," said the Hatter.
LINE 80: "Nor I," said the March Hare.
LINE 81: Alice sighed wearily. "I think you might do something better with the
LINE 82: time," she said, "than waste it in asking riddles that have no
LINE 83: answers."
LINE 84: "If you knew Time as well as I do," said the Hatter, "you wouldn't talk
LINE 85: about wasting _it_. It's _him_."
LINE 86: "I don't know what you mean," said Alice.
LINE 87: "Of course you don't!" the Hatter said, tossing his head
LINE 88: contemptuously. "I dare say you never even spoke to Time!"
LINE 89: "Perhaps not," Alice cautiously replied: "but I know I have to beat
LINE 90: time when I learn music."
LINE 91: "Ah! that accounts for it," said the Hatter. "He won't stand beating.
LINE 92: Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything
LINE 93: you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in
LINE 94: the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a
LINE 95: hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,
LINE 96: time for dinner!"
LINE 97: ("I only wish it was," the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)
LINE 98: "That would be grand, certainly," said Alice thoughtfully: "but then—I
LINE 99: shouldn't be hungry for it, you know."
LINE 100: "Not at first, perhaps," said the Hatter: "but you could keep it to
LINE 101: half-past one as long as you liked."
LINE 102: "Is that the way _you_ manage?" Alice asked.
LINE 103: The Hatter shook his head mournfully. "Not I!" he replied. "We
LINE 104: quarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—" (pointing
LINE 105: with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) "—it was at the great concert
LINE 106: given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
LINE 107: 'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
LINE 108: How I wonder what you're at!'
LINE 109: You know the song, perhaps?"
LINE 110: "I've heard something like it," said Alice.
LINE 111: "It goes on, you know," the Hatter continued, "in this way:—
LINE 112: 'Up above the world you fly,
LINE 113: Like a tea-tray in the sky.
LINE 114: Twinkle, twinkle—'"
LINE 115: Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
LINE 116: "_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—" and went on so long that they
LINE 117: had to pinch it to make it stop.
LINE 118: "Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse," said the Hatter, "when the
LINE 119: Queen jumped up and bawled out, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his
LINE 120: head!'"
LINE 121: "How dreadfully savage!" exclaimed Alice.
LINE 122: "And ever since that," the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, "he won't
LINE 123: do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now."
LINE 124: A bright idea came into Alice's head. "Is that the reason so many
LINE 125: tea-things are put out here?" she asked.
LINE 126: "Yes, that's it," said the Hatter with a sigh: "it's always tea-time,
LINE 127: and we've no time to wash the things between whiles."
LINE 128: "Then you keep moving round, I suppose?" said Alice.
LINE 129: "Exactly so," said the Hatter: "as the things get used up."
LINE 130: "But what happens when you come to the beginning again?" Alice ventured
LINE 131: to ask.
LINE 132: "Suppose we change the subject," the March Hare interrupted, yawning.
LINE 133: "I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story."
LINE 134: "I'm afraid I don't know one," said Alice, rather alarmed at the
LINE 135: proposal.
LINE 136: "Then the Dormouse shall!" they both cried. "Wake up, Dormouse!" And
LINE 137: they pinched it on both sides at once.
LINE 138: The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. "I wasn't asleep," he said in a
LINE 139: hoarse, feeble voice: "I heard every word you fellows were saying."
LINE 140: "Tell us a story!" said the March Hare.
LINE 141: "Yes, please do!" pleaded Alice.
LINE 142: "And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or you'll be asleep again
LINE 143: before it's done."
LINE 144: "Once upon a time there were three little sisters," the Dormouse began
LINE 145: in a great hurry; "and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and
LINE 146: they lived at the bottom of a well—"
LINE 147: "What did they live on?" said Alice, who always took a great interest
LINE 148: in questions of eating and drinking.
LINE 149: "They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or
LINE 150: two.
LINE 151: "They couldn't have done that, you know," Alice gently remarked;
LINE 152: "they'd have been ill."
LINE 153: "So they were," said the Dormouse; "_very_ ill."
LINE 154: Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
LINE 155: living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: "But
LINE 156: why did they live at the bottom of a well?"
LINE 157: "Take some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
LINE 158: "I've had nothing yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't
LINE 159: take more."
LINE 160: "You mean you can't take _less_," said the Hatter: "it's very easy to
LINE 161: take _more_ than nothing."
LINE 162: "Nobody asked _your_ opinion," said Alice.
LINE 163: "Who's making personal remarks now?" the Hatter asked triumphantly.
LINE 164: Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
LINE 165: some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and
LINE 166: repeated her question. "Why did they live at the bottom of a well?"
LINE 167: The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
LINE 168: said, "It was a treacle-well."
LINE 169: "There's no such thing!" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the
LINE 170: Hatter and the March Hare went "Sh! sh!" and the Dormouse sulkily
LINE 171: remarked, "If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for
LINE 172: yourself."
LINE 173: "No, please go on!" Alice said very humbly; "I won't interrupt again. I
LINE 174: dare say there may be _one_."
LINE 175: "One, indeed!" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to
LINE 176: go on. "And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,
LINE 177: you know—"
LINE 178: "What did they draw?" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.
LINE 179: "Treacle," said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
LINE 180: "I want a clean cup," interrupted the Hatter: "let's all move one place
LINE 181: on."
LINE 182: He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare
LINE 183: moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the
LINE 184: place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any
LINE 185: advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than
LINE 186: before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
LINE 187: Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very
LINE 188: cautiously: "But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle
LINE 189: from?"
LINE 190: "You can draw water out of a water-well," said the Hatter; "so I should
LINE 191: think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?"
LINE 192: "But they were _in_ the well," Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing
LINE 193: to notice this last remark.
LINE 194: "Of course they were," said the Dormouse; "—well in."
LINE 195: This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for
LINE 196: some time without interrupting it.
LINE 197: "They were learning to draw," the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
LINE 198: its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; "and they drew all manner of
LINE 199: things—everything that begins with an M—"
LINE 200: "Why with an M?" said Alice.
LINE 201: "Why not?" said the March Hare.
LINE 202: Alice was silent.
LINE 203: The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
LINE 204: doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a
LINE 205: little shriek, and went on: "—that begins with an M, such as
LINE 206: mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
LINE 207: things are "much of a muchness"—did you ever see such a thing as a
LINE 208: drawing of a muchness?"
LINE 209: "Really, now you ask me," said Alice, very much confused, "I don't
LINE 210: think—"
LINE 211: "Then you shouldn't talk," said the Hatter.
LINE 212: This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in
LINE 213: great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
LINE 214: neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
LINE 215: looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
LINE 216: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into
LINE 217: the teapot.
LINE 218: "At any rate I'll never go _there_ again!" said Alice as she picked her
LINE 219: way through the wood. "It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
LINE 220: all my life!"
LINE 221: Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
LINE 222: leading right into it. "That's very curious!" she thought. "But
LINE 223: everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once." And
LINE 224: in she went.
LINE 225: Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
LINE 226: glass table. "Now, I'll manage better this time," she said to herself,
LINE 227: and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
LINE 228: led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
LINE 229: (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot
LINE 230: high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found
LINE 231: herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
LINE 232: and the cool fountains.
