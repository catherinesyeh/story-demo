LINE 1: The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
LINE 2: It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
LINE 3: anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
LINE 4: it muttering to itself "The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh
LINE 5: my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
LINE 6: ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?" Alice guessed in a
LINE 7: moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
LINE 8: gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
LINE 9: they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
LINE 10: her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
LINE 11: little door, had vanished completely.
LINE 12: Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and
LINE 13: called out to her in an angry tone, "Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you
LINE 14: doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
LINE 15: a fan! Quick, now!" And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off
LINE 16: at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
LINE 17: mistake it had made.
LINE 18: "He took me for his housemaid," she said to herself as she ran. "How
LINE 19: surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him
LINE 20: his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them." As she said this, she
LINE 21: came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
LINE 22: plate with the name "W. RABBIT," engraved upon it. She went in without
LINE 23: knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
LINE 24: real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
LINE 25: fan and gloves.
LINE 26: "How queer it seems," Alice said to herself, "to be going messages for
LINE 27: a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!" And she
LINE 28: began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: "'Miss Alice! Come
LINE 29: here directly, and get ready for your walk!' 'Coming in a minute,
LINE 30: nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.' Only I
LINE 31: don't think," Alice went on, "that they'd let Dinah stop in the house
LINE 32: if it began ordering people about like that!"
LINE 33: By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
LINE 34: in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three
LINE 35: pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
LINE 36: gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
LINE 37: little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label
LINE 38: this time with the words "DRINK ME," but nevertheless she uncorked it
LINE 39: and put it to her lips. "I know _something_ interesting is sure to
LINE 40: happen," she said to herself, "whenever I eat or drink anything; so
LINE 41: I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large
LINE 42: again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!"
LINE 43: It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
LINE 44: drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
LINE 45: and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put
LINE 46: down the bottle, saying to herself "That's quite enough—I hope I shan't
LINE 47: grow any more—As it is, I can't get out at the door—I do wish I hadn't
LINE 48: drunk quite so much!"
LINE 49: Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,
LINE 50: and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
LINE 51: was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
LINE 52: one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
LINE 53: Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
LINE 54: of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself "Now I
LINE 55: can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?"
LINE 56: Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
LINE 57: and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
LINE 58: seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
LINE 59: again, no wonder she felt unhappy.
LINE 60: "It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't
LINE 61: always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
LINE 62: rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
LINE 63: yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what
LINE 64: _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied
LINE 65: that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of
LINE 66: one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And
LINE 67: when I grow up, I'll write one—but I'm grown up now," she added in a
LINE 68: sorrowful tone; "at least there's no room to grow up any more _here_."
LINE 69: "But then," thought Alice, "shall I _never_ get any older than I am
LINE 70: now? That'll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but
LINE 71: then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like _that!_"
LINE 72: "Oh, you foolish Alice!" she answered herself. "How can you learn
LINE 73: lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for _you_, and no room at all
LINE 74: for any lesson-books!"
LINE 75: And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
LINE 76: making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
LINE 77: she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
LINE 78: "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice. "Fetch me my gloves this moment!"
LINE 79: Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was
LINE 80: the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
LINE 81: house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
LINE 82: large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
LINE 83: Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
LINE 84: the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,
LINE 85: that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself "Then I'll
LINE 86: go round and get in at the window."
LINE 87: "_That_ you won't!" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
LINE 88: she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
LINE 89: hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,
LINE 90: but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
LINE 91: from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
LINE 92: cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
LINE 93: Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit's—"Pat! Pat! Where are you?" And
LINE 94: then a voice she had never heard before, "Sure then I'm here! Digging
LINE 95: for apples, yer honour!"
LINE 96: "Digging for apples, indeed!" said the Rabbit angrily. "Here! Come and
LINE 97: help me out of _this!_" (Sounds of more broken glass.)
LINE 98: "Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?"
LINE 99: "Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum.")
LINE 100: "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole
LINE 101: window!"
LINE 102: "Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that."
LINE 103: "Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!"
LINE 104: There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers
LINE 105: now and then; such as, "Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at
LINE 106: all!" "Do as I tell you, you coward!" and at last she spread out her
LINE 107: hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were
LINE 108: _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. "What a number
LINE 109: of cucumber-frames there must be!" thought Alice. "I wonder what
LINE 110: they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
LINE 111: _could!_ I'm sure _I_ don't want to stay in here any longer!"
LINE 112: She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
LINE 113: rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
LINE 114: talking together: she made out the words: "Where's the other
LINE 115: ladder?—Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other—Bill!
LINE 116: fetch it here, lad!—Here, put 'em up at this corner—No, tie 'em
LINE 117: together first—they don't reach half high enough yet—Oh! they'll do
LINE 118: well enough; don't be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this
LINE 119: rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it's coming down!
LINE 120: Heads below!" (a loud crash)—"Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I
LINE 121: fancy—Who's to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan't! _You_ do
LINE 122: it!—_That_ I won't, then!—Bill's to go down—Here, Bill! the master says
LINE 123: you're to go down the chimney!"
LINE 124: "Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said Alice to
LINE 125: herself. "Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in
LINE 126: Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
LINE 127: I _think_ I can kick a little!"
LINE 128: She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
LINE 129: she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)
LINE 130: scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
LINE 131: saying to herself "This is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited
LINE 132: to see what would happen next.
LINE 133: The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "There goes Bill!"
LINE 134: then the Rabbit's voice along—"Catch him, you by the hedge!" then
LINE 135: silence, and then another confusion of voices—"Hold up his head—Brandy
LINE 136: now—Don't choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell
LINE 137: us all about it!"
LINE 138: Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ("That's Bill," thought
LINE 139: Alice,) "Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I'm better now—but I'm
LINE 140: a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me
LINE 141: like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"
LINE 142: "So you did, old fellow!" said the others.
LINE 143: "We must burn the house down!" said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice
LINE 144: called out as loud as she could, "If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!"
LINE 145: There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, "I
LINE 146: wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the
LINE 147: roof off." After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
LINE 148: Alice heard the Rabbit say, "A barrowful will do, to begin with."
LINE 149: "A barrowful of _what?_" thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,
LINE 150: for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
LINE 151: window, and some of them hit her in the face. "I'll put a stop to
LINE 152: this," she said to herself, and shouted out, "You'd better not do that
LINE 153: again!" which produced another dead silence.
LINE 154: Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
LINE 155: little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
LINE 156: head. "If I eat one of these cakes," she thought, "it's sure to make
LINE 157: _some_ change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it
LINE 158: must make me smaller, I suppose."
LINE 159: So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
LINE 160: began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get
LINE 161: through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
LINE 162: little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,
LINE 163: was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
LINE 164: something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she
LINE 165: appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
LINE 166: safe in a thick wood.
LINE 167: "The first thing I've got to do," said Alice to herself, as she
LINE 168: wandered about in the wood, "is to grow to my right size again; and the
LINE 169: second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that
LINE 170: will be the best plan."
LINE 171: It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
LINE 172: arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
LINE 173: how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
LINE 174: the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
LINE 175: great hurry.
LINE 176: An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
LINE 177: feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. "Poor little
LINE 178: thing!" said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
LINE 179: it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
LINE 180: might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
LINE 181: spite of all her coaxing.
LINE 182: Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
LINE 183: held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
LINE 184: all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
LINE 185: and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,
LINE 186: to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
LINE 187: other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
LINE 188: over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
LINE 189: very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
LINE 190: moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
LINE 191: the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
LINE 192: little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
LINE 193: all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
LINE 194: its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
LINE 195: This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
LINE 196: set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
LINE 197: and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.
LINE 198: "And yet what a dear little puppy it was!" said Alice, as she leant
LINE 199: against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
LINE 200: leaves: "I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I'd
LINE 201: only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that
LINE 202: I've got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I
LINE 203: suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
LINE 204: question is, what?"
LINE 205: The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at
LINE 206: the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
LINE 207: looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
LINE 208: There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
LINE 209: herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
LINE 210: behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
LINE 211: was on the top of it.
LINE 212: She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
LINE 213: mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
LINE 214: caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
LINE 215: smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
LINE 216: anything else.
