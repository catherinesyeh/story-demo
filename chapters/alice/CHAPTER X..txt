LINE 1: The Lobster Quadrille
LINE 2: The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
LINE 3: his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
LINE 4: two sobs choked his voice. "Same as if he had a bone in his throat,"
LINE 5: said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
LINE 6: the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
LINE 7: running down his cheeks, he went on again:—
LINE 8: "You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't," said
LINE 9: Alice)—"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—"
LINE 10: (Alice began to say "I once tasted—" but checked herself hastily, and
LINE 11: said "No, never") "—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
LINE 12: Lobster Quadrille is!"
LINE 13: "No, indeed," said Alice. "What sort of a dance is it?"
LINE 14: "Why," said the Gryphon, "you first form into a line along the
LINE 15: sea-shore—"
LINE 16: "Two lines!" cried the Mock Turtle. "Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
LINE 17: then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—"
LINE 18: "_That_ generally takes some time," interrupted the Gryphon.
LINE 19: "—you advance twice—"
LINE 20: "Each with a lobster as a partner!" cried the Gryphon.
LINE 21: "Of course," the Mock Turtle said: "advance twice, set to partners—"
LINE 22: "—change lobsters, and retire in same order," continued the Gryphon.
LINE 23: "Then, you know," the Mock Turtle went on, "you throw the—"
LINE 24: "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.
LINE 25: "—as far out to sea as you can—"
LINE 26: "Swim after them!" screamed the Gryphon.
LINE 27: "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly
LINE 28: about.
LINE 29: "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.
LINE 30: "Back to land again, and that's all the first figure," said the Mock
LINE 31: Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
LINE 32: been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
LINE 33: sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.
LINE 34: "It must be a very pretty dance," said Alice timidly.
LINE 35: "Would you like to see a little of it?" said the Mock Turtle.
LINE 36: "Very much indeed," said Alice.
LINE 37: "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the Mock Turtle to the
LINE 38: Gryphon. "We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?"
LINE 39: "Oh, _you_ sing," said the Gryphon. "I've forgotten the words."
LINE 40: So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and
LINE 41: then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
LINE 42: forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly
LINE 43: and sadly:—
LINE 44: "Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
LINE 45: "There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
LINE 46: See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
LINE 47: They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?
LINE 48: Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
LINE 49: Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
LINE 50: "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
LINE 51: When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
LINE 52: But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance—
LINE 53: Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
LINE 54: Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
LINE 55: Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.
LINE 56: "What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
LINE 57: "There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
LINE 58: The further off from England the nearer is to France—
LINE 59: Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
LINE 60: Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?
LINE 61: Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?"
LINE 62: "Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch," said Alice,
LINE 63: feeling very glad that it was over at last: "and I do so like that
LINE 64: curious song about the whiting!"
LINE 65: "Oh, as to the whiting," said the Mock Turtle, "they—you've seen them,
LINE 66: of course?"
LINE 67: "Yes," said Alice, "I've often seen them at dinn—" she checked herself
LINE 68: hastily.
LINE 69: "I don't know where Dinn may be," said the Mock Turtle, "but if you've
LINE 70: seen them so often, of course you know what they're like."
LINE 71: "I believe so," Alice replied thoughtfully. "They have their tails in
LINE 72: their mouths—and they're all over crumbs."
LINE 73: "You're wrong about the crumbs," said the Mock Turtle: "crumbs would
LINE 74: all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;
LINE 75: and the reason is—" here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his
LINE 76: eyes.—"Tell her about the reason and all that," he said to the Gryphon.
LINE 77: "The reason is," said the Gryphon, "that they _would_ go with the
LINE 78: lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to
LINE 79: fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they
LINE 80: couldn't get them out again. That's all."
LINE 81: "Thank you," said Alice, "it's very interesting. I never knew so much
LINE 82: about a whiting before."
LINE 83: "I can tell you more than that, if you like," said the Gryphon. "Do you
LINE 84: know why it's called a whiting?"
LINE 85: "I never thought about it," said Alice. "Why?"
LINE 86: "_It does the boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied very solemnly.
LINE 87: Alice was thoroughly puzzled. "Does the boots and shoes!" she repeated
LINE 88: in a wondering tone.
LINE 89: "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?" said the Gryphon. "I mean, what
LINE 90: makes them so shiny?"
LINE 91: Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
LINE 92: answer. "They're done with blacking, I believe."
LINE 93: "Boots and shoes under the sea," the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,
LINE 94: "are done with a whiting. Now you know."
LINE 95: "And what are they made of?" Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.
LINE 96: "Soles and eels, of course," the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:
LINE 97: "any shrimp could have told you that."
LINE 98: "If I'd been the whiting," said Alice, whose thoughts were still
LINE 99: running on the song, "I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back,
LINE 100: please: we don't want _you_ with us!'"
LINE 101: "They were obliged to have him with them," the Mock Turtle said: "no
LINE 102: wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise."
LINE 103: "Wouldn't it really?" said Alice in a tone of great surprise.
LINE 104: "Of course not," said the Mock Turtle: "why, if a fish came to _me_,
LINE 105: and told me he was going a journey, I should say 'With what porpoise?'"
LINE 106: "Don't you mean 'purpose'?" said Alice.
LINE 107: "I mean what I say," the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And
LINE 108: the Gryphon added "Come, let's hear some of _your_ adventures."
LINE 109: "I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning," said
LINE 110: Alice a little timidly: "but it's no use going back to yesterday,
LINE 111: because I was a different person then."
LINE 112: "Explain all that," said the Mock Turtle.
LINE 113: "No, no! The adventures first," said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
LINE 114: "explanations take such a dreadful time."
LINE 115: So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
LINE 116: saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,
LINE 117: the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
LINE 118: their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she
LINE 119: went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
LINE 120: about her repeating "_You are old, Father William_," to the
LINE 121: Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock
LINE 122: Turtle drew a long breath, and said "That's very curious."
LINE 123: "It's all about as curious as it can be," said the Gryphon.
LINE 124: "It all came different!" the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. "I
LINE 125: should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to
LINE 126: begin." He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
LINE 127: authority over Alice.
LINE 128: "Stand up and repeat ''_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'" said the
LINE 129: Gryphon.
LINE 130: "How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!"
LINE 131: thought Alice; "I might as well be at school at once." However, she got
LINE 132: up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
LINE 133: Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
LINE 134: very queer indeed:—
LINE 135: "'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
LINE 136: "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
LINE 137: As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
LINE 138: Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes."
LINE 139: [later editions continued as follows
LINE 140: When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
LINE 141: And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
LINE 142: But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
LINE 143: His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]
LINE 144: "That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child," said
LINE 145: the Gryphon.
LINE 146: "Well, I never heard it before," said the Mock Turtle; "but it sounds
LINE 147: uncommon nonsense."
LINE 148: Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
LINE 149: wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.
LINE 150: "I should like to have it explained," said the Mock Turtle.
LINE 151: "She can't explain it," said the Gryphon hastily. "Go on with the next
LINE 152: verse."
LINE 153: "But about his toes?" the Mock Turtle persisted. "How _could_ he turn
LINE 154: them out with his nose, you know?"
LINE 155: "It's the first position in dancing." Alice said; but was dreadfully
LINE 156: puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
LINE 157: "Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon repeated impatiently: "it
LINE 158: begins '_I passed by his garden_.'"
LINE 159: Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
LINE 160: wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—
LINE 161: "I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
LINE 162: How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—"
LINE 163: [later editions continued as follows
LINE 164: The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
LINE 165: While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
LINE 166: When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
LINE 167: Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
LINE 168: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
LINE 169: And concluded the banquet—]
LINE 170: "What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff," the Mock Turtle
LINE 171: interrupted, "if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the
LINE 172: most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!"
LINE 173: "Yes, I think you'd better leave off," said the Gryphon: and Alice was
LINE 174: only too glad to do so.
LINE 175: "Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?" the Gryphon
LINE 176: went on. "Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?"
LINE 177: "Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind," Alice
LINE 178: replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
LINE 179: "Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her '_Turtle Soup_,' will you, old
LINE 180: fellow?"
LINE 181: The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
LINE 182: with sobs, to sing this:—
LINE 183: "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
LINE 184: Waiting in a hot tureen!
LINE 185: Who for such dainties would not stoop?
LINE 186: Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
LINE 187: Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
LINE 188: Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
LINE 189: Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
LINE 190: Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
LINE 191: Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
LINE 192: "Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
LINE 193: Game, or any other dish?
LINE 194: Who would not give all else for two p
LINE 195: ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
LINE 196: Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
LINE 197: Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
LINE 198: Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
LINE 199: Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
LINE 200: Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!"
LINE 201: "Chorus again!" cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun
LINE 202: to repeat it, when a cry of "The trial's beginning!" was heard in the
LINE 203: distance.
LINE 204: "Come on!" cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried
LINE 205: off, without waiting for the end of the song.
LINE 206: "What trial is it?" Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only
LINE 207: answered "Come on!" and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
LINE 208: came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—
LINE 209: "Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
LINE 210: Beautiful, beautiful Soup!"
