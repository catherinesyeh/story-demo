LINE 1: The Mock Turtle's Story
LINE 2: "You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!"
LINE 3: said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's,
LINE 4: and they walked off together.
LINE 5: Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
LINE 6: to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
LINE 7: savage when they met in the kitchen.
LINE 8: "When _I'm_ a Duchess," she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful
LINE 9: tone though), "I won't have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup
LINE 10: does very well without—Maybe it's always pepper that makes people
LINE 11: hot-tempered," she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
LINE 12: kind of rule, "and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes
LINE 13: them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children
LINE 14: sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be
LINE 15: so stingy about it, you know—"
LINE 16: She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little
LINE 17: startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. "You're thinking
LINE 18: about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't
LINE 19: tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in
LINE 20: a bit."
LINE 21: "Perhaps it hasn't one," Alice ventured to remark.
LINE 22: "Tut, tut, child!" said the Duchess. "Everything's got a moral, if only
LINE 23: you can find it." And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
LINE 24: she spoke.
LINE 25: Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
LINE 26: Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
LINE 27: right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an
LINE 28: uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she
LINE 29: bore it as well as she could.
LINE 30: "The game's going on rather better now," she said, by way of keeping up
LINE 31: the conversation a little.
LINE 32: "'Tis so," said the Duchess: "and the moral of that is—'Oh, 'tis love,
LINE 33: 'tis love, that makes the world go round!'"
LINE 34: "Somebody said," Alice whispered, "that it's done by everybody minding
LINE 35: their own business!"
LINE 36: "Ah, well! It means much the same thing," said the Duchess, digging her
LINE 37: sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, "and the moral of
LINE 38: _that_ is—'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
LINE 39: themselves.'"
LINE 40: "How fond she is of finding morals in things!" Alice thought to
LINE 41: herself.
LINE 42: "I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,"
LINE 43: the Duchess said after a pause: "the reason is, that I'm doubtful about
LINE 44: the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?"
LINE 45: "He might bite," Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
LINE 46: to have the experiment tried.
LINE 47: "Very true," said the Duchess: "flamingoes and mustard both bite. And
LINE 48: the moral of that is—'Birds of a feather flock together.'"
LINE 49: "Only mustard isn't a bird," Alice remarked.
LINE 50: "Right, as usual," said the Duchess: "what a clear way you have of
LINE 51: putting things!"
LINE 52: "It's a mineral, I _think_," said Alice.
LINE 53: "Of course it is," said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
LINE 54: everything that Alice said; "there's a large mustard-mine near here.
LINE 55: And the moral of that is—'The more there is of mine, the less there is
LINE 56: of yours.'"
LINE 57: "Oh, I know!" exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last
LINE 58: remark, "it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is."
LINE 59: "I quite agree with you," said the Duchess; "and the moral of that
LINE 60: is—'Be what you would seem to be'—or if you'd like it put more
LINE 61: simply—'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
LINE 62: appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
LINE 63: otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
LINE 64: otherwise.'"
LINE 65: "I think I should understand that better," Alice said very politely,
LINE 66: "if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it."
LINE 67: "That's nothing to what I could say if I chose," the Duchess replied,
LINE 68: in a pleased tone.
LINE 69: "Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that," said
LINE 70: Alice.
LINE 71: "Oh, don't talk about trouble!" said the Duchess. "I make you a present
LINE 72: of everything I've said as yet."
LINE 73: "A cheap sort of present!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they don't give
LINE 74: birthday presents like that!" But she did not venture to say it out
LINE 75: loud.
LINE 76: "Thinking again?" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
LINE 77: little chin.
LINE 78: "I've a right to think," said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to
LINE 79: feel a little worried.
LINE 80: "Just about as much right," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly; and
LINE 81: the m—"
LINE 82: But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away,
LINE 83: even in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was
LINE 84: linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the
LINE 85: Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
LINE 86: thunderstorm.
LINE 87: "A fine day, your Majesty!" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
LINE 88: "Now, I give you fair warning," shouted the Queen, stamping on the
LINE 89: ground as she spoke; "either you or your head must be off, and that in
LINE 90: about half no time! Take your choice!"
LINE 91: The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.
LINE 92: "Let's go on with the game," the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too
LINE 93: much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
LINE 94: croquet-ground.
LINE 95: The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were
LINE 96: resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
LINE 97: back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay
LINE 98: would cost them their lives.
LINE 99: All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling
LINE 100: with the other players, and shouting "Off with his head!" or "Off with
LINE 101: her head!" Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
LINE 102: soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
LINE 103: that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
LINE 104: all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody
LINE 105: and under sentence of execution.
LINE 106: Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, "Have
LINE 107: you seen the Mock Turtle yet?"
LINE 108: "No," said Alice. "I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is."
LINE 109: "It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from," said the Queen.
LINE 110: "I never saw one, or heard of one," said Alice.
LINE 111: "Come on, then," said the Queen, "and he shall tell you his history,"
LINE 112: As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,
LINE 113: to the company generally, "You are all pardoned." "Come, _that's_ a
LINE 114: good thing!" she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
LINE 115: number of executions the Queen had ordered.
LINE 116: They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If
LINE 117: you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) "Up, lazy
LINE 118: thing!" said the Queen, "and take this young lady to see the Mock
LINE 119: Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some
LINE 120: executions I have ordered;" and she walked off, leaving Alice alone
LINE 121: with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
LINE 122: but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
LINE 123: as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
LINE 124: The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till
LINE 125: she was out of sight: then it chuckled. "What fun!" said the Gryphon,
LINE 126: half to itself, half to Alice.
LINE 127: "What _is_ the fun?" said Alice.
LINE 128: "Why, _she_," said the Gryphon. "It's all her fancy, that: they never
LINE 129: executes nobody, you know. Come on!"
LINE 130: "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought Alice, as she went slowly
LINE 131: after it: "I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!"
LINE 132: They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,
LINE 133: sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
LINE 134: nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She
LINE 135: pitied him deeply. "What is his sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon, and the
LINE 136: Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "It's all
LINE 137: his fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!"
LINE 138: So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
LINE 139: full of tears, but said nothing.
LINE 140: "This here young lady," said the Gryphon, "she wants for to know your
LINE 141: history, she do."
LINE 142: "I'll tell it her," said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: "sit
LINE 143: down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished."
LINE 144: So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to
LINE 145: herself, "I don't see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn't begin."
LINE 146: But she waited patiently.
LINE 147: "Once," said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real
LINE 148: Turtle."
LINE 149: These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
LINE 150: occasional exclamation of "Hjckrrh!" from the Gryphon, and the constant
LINE 151: heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and
LINE 152: saying, "Thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but she could not
LINE 153: help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said
LINE 154: nothing.
LINE 155: "When we were little," the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,
LINE 156: though still sobbing a little now and then, "we went to school in the
LINE 157: sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—"
LINE 158: "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" Alice asked.
LINE 159: "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle
LINE 160: angrily: "really you are very dull!"
LINE 161: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
LINE 162: question," added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
LINE 163: at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the
LINE 164: Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, "Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all
LINE 165: day about it!" and he went on in these words:
LINE 166: "Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it—"
LINE 167: "I never said I didn't!" interrupted Alice.
LINE 168: "You did," said the Mock Turtle.
LINE 169: "Hold your tongue!" added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
LINE 170: The Mock Turtle went on.
LINE 171: "We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—"
LINE 172: "_I've_ been to a day-school, too," said Alice; "you needn't be so
LINE 173: proud as all that."
LINE 174: "With extras?" asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
LINE 175: "Yes," said Alice, "we learned French and music."
LINE 176: "And washing?" said the Mock Turtle.
LINE 177: "Certainly not!" said Alice indignantly.
LINE 178: "Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school," said the Mock Turtle in a
LINE 179: tone of great relief. "Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,
LINE 180: 'French, music, _and washing_—extra.'"
LINE 181: "You couldn't have wanted it much," said Alice; "living at the bottom
LINE 182: of the sea."
LINE 183: "I couldn't afford to learn it." said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. "I
LINE 184: only took the regular course."
LINE 185: "What was that?" inquired Alice.
LINE 186: "Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with," the Mock Turtle
LINE 187: replied; "and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,
LINE 188: Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."
LINE 189: "I never heard of 'Uglification,'" Alice ventured to say. "What is it?"
LINE 190: The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. "What! Never heard of
LINE 191: uglifying!" it exclaimed. "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?"
LINE 192: "Yes," said Alice doubtfully: "it means—to—make—anything—prettier."
LINE 193: "Well, then," the Gryphon went on, "if you don't know what to uglify
LINE 194: is, you _are_ a simpleton."
LINE 195: Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
LINE 196: she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said "What else had you to learn?"
LINE 197: "Well, there was Mystery," the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the
LINE 198: subjects on his flappers, "—Mystery, ancient and modern, with
LINE 199: Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
LINE 200: that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and
LINE 201: Fainting in Coils."
LINE 202: "What was _that_ like?" said Alice.
LINE 203: "Well, I can't show it you myself," the Mock Turtle said: "I'm too
LINE 204: stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it."
LINE 205: "Hadn't time," said the Gryphon: "I went to the Classics master,
LINE 206: though. He was an old crab, _he_ was."
LINE 207: "I never went to him," the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: "he taught
LINE 208: Laughing and Grief, they used to say."
LINE 209: "So he did, so he did," said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
LINE 210: creatures hid their faces in their paws.
LINE 211: "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?" said Alice, in a hurry
LINE 212: to change the subject.
LINE 213: "Ten hours the first day," said the Mock Turtle: "nine the next, and so
LINE 214: on."
LINE 215: "What a curious plan!" exclaimed Alice.
LINE 216: "That's the reason they're called lessons," the Gryphon remarked:
LINE 217: "because they lessen from day to day."
LINE 218: This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little
LINE 219: before she made her next remark. "Then the eleventh day must have been
LINE 220: a holiday?"
LINE 221: "Of course it was," said the Mock Turtle.
LINE 222: "And how did you manage on the twelfth?" Alice went on eagerly.
LINE 223: "That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very
LINE 224: decided tone: "tell her something about the games now."
