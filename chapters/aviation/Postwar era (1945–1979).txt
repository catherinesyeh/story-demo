LINE 1: Following World War II, commercial aviation expanded quickly, primarily relying
LINE 2: on former military aircraft to carry passengers and cargo. There was an excess
LINE 3: of large bombers, such as the B-29 and Lancaster, which were easily converted
LINE 4: for commercial use. The DC-3 specifically played a key role, enabling longer
LINE 5: and more efficient flights.
LINE 6: The British de Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner and was
LINE 7: introduced into scheduled service by 1952. The aircraft was a breakthrough in
LINE 8: technical achievements, but had several intense failures. The square design of
LINE 9: the windows caused stress cracks from metal fatigue, caused by cycles of cabin
LINE 10: pressurization and depressurization. This eventually led to severe structural
LINE 11: failures in the fuel area. These issues were resolved too late, since competing
LINE 12: jet airliners were already flying.
LINE 13: On 15 September 1956, the USSR's airline Aeroflot became the first to offer
LINE 14: continuous, regular jet services using the Tupolev Tu-104. Soon after, Boeing
LINE 15: 707 and DC-8 also set new standards in comfort, safety, and passenger
LINE 16: experience. This was the beginning of the Jet Age, the introduction of
LINE 17: large-scale commercial air travel.
LINE 18: In October 1947, Chuck Yeager became the first to fly faster than the speed of
LINE 19: sound when he piloted the rocket-powered Bell X-1 past the sound barrier. The
LINE 20: air speed record for an aircraft was set by the X-15 at 4,534 mph (7,297 km/h)
LINE 21: or Mach 6.1 in 1967. This record was later broken by the X-43 in 2004,
LINE 22: excluding spacecraft.
LINE 23: Military aircraft had a strategic advantage during the Cold War with the
LINE 24: invention of nuclear bombs in 1945. Even just a small fleet of bombers could
LINE 25: inflict catastrophic damage, which caused for the development of effective
LINE 26: defenses. One early development was supersonic interceptor aircraft. By 1955,
LINE 27: the focus shifted toward guided surface-to-air missiles. This eventually led to
LINE 28: the emergence of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which have
LINE 29: nuclear capabilities. An early example of ICBMs occurred in 1957 when the
LINE 30: Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, beginning the Space Race.
LINE 31: In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space when he completed a
LINE 32: single orbit around Earth in 108 minutes aboard Vostok I. Following this, the
LINE 33: United States sent Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight using a Mercury program
LINE 34: capsule. In 1963, Canada became the third nation to enter space with the launch
LINE 35: of its satellite, Alouette I. The space race culminated in the landing on the
LINE 36: moon in 1969.
LINE 37: The Harrier jump jet, capable of vertical landing and takeoff, first flew in
LINE 38: 1969. This was also the year of the introduction of the Boeing 747.
LINE 39: Additionally, the Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic passenger airliner had
LINE 40: its maiden flight. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft
LINE 41: ever to fly at the time, now replaced by the Airbus A380, capable of
LINE 42: transporting 853 passengers. Aeroflot started flying the Tu-144—the first
LINE 43: supersonic passenger plane in 1975. The next year, British Airways and Air
LINE 44: France began supersonic flights over the Atlantic.
LINE 45: In 1979, the Gossamer Albatross achieved the status of the first human-powered
LINE 46: aircraft to fly over the English channel, which had been a dream for centuries.
