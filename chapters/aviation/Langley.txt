LINE 1: After a distinguished career in astronomy and shortly before becoming Secretary
LINE 2: of the Smithsonian Institution, Samuel Pierpont Langley started a serious
LINE 3: investigation into aerodynamics at what is today the University of Pittsburgh.
LINE 4: In 1891, he published Experiments in Aerodynamics detailing his research, and
LINE 5: then turned to building his designs. He hoped to achieve automatic aerodynamic
LINE 6: stability, so he gave little consideration to in-flight control. On 6 May 1896,
LINE 7: Langley's Aerodrome No. 5 made the first successful sustained flight of an
LINE 8: unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was
LINE 9: launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the
LINE 10: Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon,
LINE 11: one of 1,005 metres (3,297 ft) and a second of 700 metres (2,300 ft), at a
LINE 12: speed of approximately 25 miles per hour (40 km/h). On both occasions, the
LINE 13: Aerodrome No. 5 landed in the water as planned, because, in order to save
LINE 14: weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On 28 November 1896, another
LINE 15: successful flight was made with the Aerodrome No. 6. This flight, of 1,460
LINE 16: metres (4,790 ft), was witnessed and photographed by Alexander Graham Bell. The
LINE 17: Aerodrome No. 6 was actually Aerodrome No. 4 greatly modified. So little
LINE 18: remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation.
LINE 19: With the successes of the Aerodrome No. 5 and No. 6, Langley started looking
LINE 20: for funding to build a full-scale man-carrying version of his designs. Spurred
LINE 21: by the Spanish–American War, the U.S. government granted him $50,000 to develop
LINE 22: a man-carrying flying machine for aerial reconnaissance. Langley planned on
LINE 23: building a scaled-up version known as the Aerodrome A, and started with the
LINE 24: smaller Quarter-scale Aerodrome, which flew twice on 18 June 1901, and then
LINE 25: again with a newer and more powerful engine in 1903.
LINE 26: With the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to the
LINE 27: problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one, but
LINE 28: was disappointed when it delivered only 8 hp (6.0 kW) instead of the 12 hp
LINE 29: (8.9 kW) he expected. Langley's assistant, Charles M. Manly, then reworked the
LINE 30: design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered 52 hp (39 kW) at
LINE 31: 950 rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with both power and a design,
LINE 32: Langley put the two together with great hopes.
LINE 33: To his dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. Simply scaling
LINE 34: up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold
LINE 35: itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the Aerodrome
LINE 36: immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time.
LINE 37: Also, the aircraft's control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot
LINE 38: responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the Aerodrome's aerial
LINE 39: stability was marginal.
LINE 40: Langley's attempts to gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine
LINE 41: days after his second abortive launch on 8 December, the Wright brothers
LINE 42: successfully flew their Flyer. Glenn Curtiss made 93 modifications to the
LINE 43: Aerodrome and flew this very different aircraft in 1914. Without acknowledging
LINE 44: the modifications, the Smithsonian Institution asserted that Langley's
LINE 45: Aerodrome was the first machine "capable of flight".
