LINE 1: Airships were originally called "dirigible balloons" and are still sometimes
LINE 2: called dirigibles today.
LINE 3: Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically
LINE 4: throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained
LINE 5: lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when Henri
LINE 6: Giffard flew 15 miles (24 km) in France, with a steam engine-driven craft.
LINE 7: Another advancement was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable
LINE 8: free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, La France, by
LINE 9: Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs. The 170-foot (52 m) long, 66,000-cubic-foot
LINE 10: (1,900 m3) airship covered 8 km (5.0 mi) in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8½
LINE 11: horsepower electric motor.
LINE 12: However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail.
LINE 13: Routine, controlled flights did not occur until the advent of the internal
LINE 14: combustion engine.
LINE 15: The first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships
LINE 16: (sometimes called "blimps".) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this
LINE 17: type of aircraft was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively
LINE 18: combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he
LINE 19: flew his airship Number 6 over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the
LINE 20: Eiffel Tower and back in under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe
LINE 21: prize. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The
LINE 22: subsequent controversy surrounding his and others' competing claims with regard
LINE 23: to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.
LINE 24: At the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success,
LINE 25: the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These were far
LINE 26: more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo-carrying capacity
LINE 27: for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German
LINE 28: count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.
LINE 29: Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly
LINE 30: hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, Friedrichshafen. This was
LINE 31: intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned
LINE 32: with the wind. The prototype airship LZ 1 (LZ for "Luftschiff Zeppelin") had a
LINE 33: length of 128 m (420 ft), was driven by two 10.6 kW (14.2 hp) Daimler engines
LINE 34: and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.
LINE 35: Its first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as LZ 1 was
LINE 36: forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight
LINE 37: had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent
LINE 38: flights, bettering the 6 m/s speed attained by the French airship La France by
LINE 39: 3 m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It was several years
LINE 40: before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.
LINE 41: The German airship passenger service known as DELAG (Deutsche-Luftschiffahrts
LINE 42: AG) was established in 1910.
LINE 43: Although airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a
LINE 44: limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by
LINE 45: heavier-than-air craft.
