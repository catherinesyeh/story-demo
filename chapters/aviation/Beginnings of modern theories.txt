LINE 1: Francesco Lana de Terzi proposed in Prodromo dell'Arte Maestra (1670) that
LINE 2: large vessels could float in the atmosphere by applying the principles of a
LINE 3: vacuum. Lana designed an airship with four huge copper foil spheres connected
LINE 4: to support a rider's basket, a tail, and a steering rudder. Critics argued that
LINE 5: the thin copper spheres could not sustain ambient air pressure, and further
LINE 6: experiments proved that his idea was impossible.
LINE 7: Using a vacuum to create lift is called a vacuum airship, but it is still
LINE 8: impossible to build with the materials available today.
LINE 9: In 1709, Bartolomeu de Gusmão approached King John V of Portugal and claimed to
LINE 10: have discovered a way for airborne flight.
LINE 11: Due to the King's illness, Gusmão's experiment was rescheduled from its initial
LINE 12: 24 June 1709, date to 8 August. The experiment was carried out in front of the
LINE 13: king and other nobles in the Casa da India yard, but the paper ship or device
LINE 14: burned down before it could take flight.
