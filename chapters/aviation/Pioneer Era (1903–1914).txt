LINE 1: This period saw the development of practical aeroplanes and airships and their
LINE 2: early application, alongside balloons and kites, for private, sport and
LINE 3: military use.
LINE 4: #### Pioneers in Europe
LINE 5: Although the full details of the Wright Brothers' system of flight control had
LINE 6: been published in l'Aerophile in January 1906, the importance of this advance
LINE 7: was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on
LINE 8: attempting to produce inherently stable machines.
LINE 9: Short powered flights were performed in France by Romanian engineer Traian Vuia
LINE 10: on 18 March and 19 August 1906 when he flew 12 and 24 metres, respectively, in
LINE 11: a self-designed, fully self-propelled, fixed-wing aircraft, that possessed a
LINE 12: fully wheeled undercarriage. He was followed by Jacob Ellehammer who built a
LINE 13: monoplane which he tested with a tether in Denmark on 12 September 1906, flying
LINE 14: 42 metres.
LINE 15: On 13 September 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made a public flight
LINE 16: in Paris with the 14-bis, also known as Oiseau de proie (French for "bird of
LINE 17: prey"). This was canard configured with a pronounced wing dihedral, and covered
LINE 18: a distance of 60 m (200 ft) on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in
LINE 19: Paris' Bois de Boulogne before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented
LINE 20: event was the first flight verified by the Aéro-Club de France of a powered
LINE 21: heavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the
LINE 22: first officially observed flight greater than 25 m (82 ft). On 12 November
LINE 23: 1906, Santos-Dumont set the first world record recognized by the Federation
LINE 24: Aeronautique Internationale by flying 220 m (720 ft) in 21.5 seconds. Only one
LINE 25: more brief flight was made by the 14-bis in March 1907, after which it was
LINE 26: abandoned.
LINE 27: In March 1907, Gabriel Voisin flew the first example of his Voisin biplane. On
LINE 28: 13 January 1908, a second example was flown by Henri Farman to win the
LINE 29: Deutsch-Archdeacon Grand Prix d'Aviation prize for a flight in which the
LINE 30: aircraft flew a distance of more than a kilometre and landed at the point where
LINE 31: it had taken off. The flight lasted 1 minute and 28 seconds.
LINE 32: #### Flight as an established technology
LINE 33: Santos-Dumont later added ailerons between the wings in an effort to gain more
LINE 34: lateral stability. His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of
LINE 35: Demoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The Demoiselle No 19 could be
LINE 36: constructed in only 15 days and became the world's first series production
LINE 37: aircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120 km/h. The fuselage consisted of three
LINE 38: specially reinforced bamboo booms. The pilot sat in a seat between the main
LINE 39: wheels of a conventional landing gear whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were
LINE 40: located at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back
LINE 41: beneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by
LINE 42: a cruciform tail unit hinged on a form of universal joint at the aft end of the
LINE 43: fuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control
LINE 44: provided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping "down".
LINE 45: In 1908, Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a
LINE 46: series of flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. The first demonstration,
LINE 47: made on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French
LINE 48: aviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the
LINE 49: Wright Brothers' aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled
LINE 50: turns. The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by
LINE 51: almost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his
LINE 52: Voisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction
LINE 53: business, whose first product was the influential Farman III biplane.
LINE 54: The following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as
LINE 55: something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics. On 25 July 1909,
LINE 56: Louis Blériot won worldwide fame by winning a £1,000 prize offered by the
LINE 57: British Daily Mail newspaper for a flight across the English Channel, and in
LINE 58: August around half a million people, including the President of France Armand
LINE 59: Fallières and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George,
LINE 60: attended one of the first aviation meetings, the Grande Semaine d'Aviation at
LINE 61: Reims.
LINE 62: In 1914, pioneering aviator Tony Jannus captained the inaugural flight of the
LINE 63: St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, the world's first commercial passenger
LINE 64: airline.
LINE 65: Historians disagree about whether the Wright brothers patent war impeded
LINE 66: development of the aviation industry in the United States compared to Europe.
LINE 67: The patent war ended during World War I when the government pressured the
LINE 68: industry into forming a patent pool, and major litigants had left the industry.
LINE 69: #### Rotorcraft
LINE 70: In 1877, the Italian engineer, inventor and aeronautical pioneer Enrico
LINE 71: Forlanini developed an unmanned helicopter powered by a steam engine. It rose
LINE 72: to a height of 13 metres (43 feet), where it remained for 20 seconds, after a
LINE 73: vertical take-off from a park in Milan. Milan has dedicated its city airport to
LINE 74: Enrico Forlanini, the airport is also named Linate Airport, as well as the
LINE 75: nearby park, the Parco Forlanini. In Milan he also has an avenue named after
LINE 76: him, Viale Enrico Forlanini.
LINE 77: The first time a manned helicopter is known to have risen off the ground was on
LINE 78: a tethered flight in 1907 by the Breguet-Richet Gyroplane. Later the same year
LINE 79: the Cornu helicopter, also French, made the first rotary-winged free flight at
LINE 80: Lisieux, France. However, these were not practical designs.
LINE 81: #### Military use
LINE 82: Almost as soon as they were invented, aeroplanes were used for military
LINE 83: purposes. The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose
LINE 84: aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya
LINE 85: during the Italian-Turkish war (September 1911 – October 1912). This war also
LINE 86: saw Ottoman soldiers shoot down a warplane for the first time in history. The
LINE 87: first warplane reconnaissance mission flown on 23 October 1911 by the Italian
LINE 88: air force's Captain Carlo Piazza, and the first bombing mission was flown on 1
LINE 89: November 1911 by Italy's Second Lieutenant Giolio Gavotti. Bulgaria later
LINE 90: followed this example. Its planes attacked and reconnoitred Ottoman positions
LINE 91: during the First Balkan War 1912–13. The first war to see major use of
LINE 92: aeroplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World
LINE 93: War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used aeroplanes and airships
LINE 94: extensively.
LINE 95: While the concept of using the aeroplane as an offensive weapon was generally
LINE 96: discounted before World War I, the idea of using it for photography was one
LINE 97: that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe
LINE 98: had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached
LINE 99: to their reconnaissance departments. Radiotelephones were also being explored
LINE 100: on aeroplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground
LINE 101: commander grew more and more important.
