LINE 1: As the south-bound train was leaving the station at Philadelphia, a
LINE 2: gentleman took his seat in the single sleeping-car attached to the
LINE 3: train, and proceeded to make himself comfortable. He hung up his hat and
LINE 4: opened his newspaper, in which he remained absorbed for a quarter of an
LINE 5: hour. When the train had left the city behind, he threw the paper aside,
LINE 6: and looked around at the other occupants of the car. One of these, who
LINE 7: had been on the car since it had left New York, rose from his seat upon
LINE 8: perceiving the other's glance, and came down the aisle.
LINE 9: "How do you do, Dr. Burns?" he said, stopping beside the seat of the
LINE 10: Philadelphia passenger.
LINE 11: The gentleman looked up at the speaker with an air of surprise, which,
LINE 12: after the first keen, incisive glance, gave place to an expression of
LINE 13: cordial recognition.
LINE 14: "Why, it's Miller!" he exclaimed, rising and giving the other his hand,
LINE 15: "William Miller--Dr. Miller, of course. Sit down, Miller, and tell me
LINE 16: all about yourself,--what you're doing, where you've been, and where
LINE 17: you're going. I'm delighted to meet you, and to see you looking so
LINE 18: well--and so prosperous."
LINE 19: "I deserve no credit for either, sir," returned the other, as he took
LINE 20: the proffered seat, "for I inherited both health and prosperity. It is a
LINE 21: fortunate chance that permits me to meet you."
LINE 22: The two acquaintances, thus opportunely thrown together so that they
LINE 23: might while away in conversation the tedium of their journey,
LINE 24: represented very different and yet very similar types of manhood. A
LINE 25: celebrated traveler, after many years spent in barbarous or savage
LINE 26: lands, has said that among all varieties of mankind the similarities are
LINE 27: vastly more important and fundamental than the differences. Looking at
LINE 28: these two men with the American eye, the differences would perhaps be
LINE 29: the more striking, or at least the more immediately apparent, for the
LINE 30: first was white and the second black, or, more correctly speaking,
LINE 31: brown; it was even a light brown, but both his swarthy complexion and
LINE 32: his curly hair revealed what has been described in the laws of some of
LINE 33: our states as a "visible admixture" of African blood.
LINE 34: Having disposed of this difference, and having observed that the white
LINE 35: man was perhaps fifty years of age and the other not more than thirty,
LINE 36: it may be said that they were both tall and sturdy, both well dressed,
LINE 37: the white man with perhaps a little more distinction; both seemed from
LINE 38: their faces and their manners to be men of culture and accustomed to the
LINE 39: society of cultivated people. They were both handsome men, the elder
LINE 40: representing a fine type of Anglo-Saxon, as the term is used in speaking
LINE 41: of our composite white population; while the mulatto's erect form, broad
LINE 42: shoulders, clear eyes, fine teeth, and pleasingly moulded features
LINE 43: showed nowhere any sign of that degeneration which the pessimist so
LINE 44: sadly maintains is the inevitable heritage of mixed races.
LINE 45: As to their personal relations, it has already appeared that they were
LINE 46: members of the same profession. In past years they had been teacher and
LINE 47: pupil. Dr. Alvin Burns was professor in the famous medical college
LINE 48: where Miller had attended lectures. The professor had taken an interest
LINE 49: in his only colored pupil, to whom he had been attracted by his
LINE 50: earnestness of purpose, his evident talent, and his excellent manners
LINE 51: and fine physique. It was in part due to Dr. Burns's friendship that
LINE 52: Miller had won a scholarship which had enabled him, without drawing too
LINE 53: heavily upon his father's resources, to spend in Europe, studying in the
LINE 54: hospitals of Paris and Vienna, the two most delightful years of his
LINE 55: life. The same influence had strengthened his natural inclination toward
LINE 56: operative surgery, in which Dr. Burns was a distinguished specialist of
LINE 57: national reputation.
LINE 58: Miller's father, Adam Miller, had been a thrifty colored man, the son of
LINE 59: a slave, who, in the olden time, had bought himself with money which he
LINE 60: had earned and saved, over and above what he had paid his master for his
LINE 61: time. Adam Miller had inherited his father's thrift, as well as his
LINE 62: trade, which was that of a stevedore, or contractor for the loading and
LINE 63: unloading of vessels at the port of Wellington. In the flush turpentine
LINE 64: days following a few years after the civil war, he had made money. His
LINE 65: savings, shrewdly invested, had by constant accessions become a
LINE 66: competence. He had brought up his eldest son to the trade; the other he
LINE 67: had given a professional education, in the proud hope that his children
LINE 68: or his grandchildren might be gentlemen in the town where their
LINE 69: ancestors had once been slaves.
LINE 70: Upon his father's death, shortly after Dr. Miller's return from Europe,
LINE 71: and a year or two before the date at which this story opens, he had
LINE 72: promptly spent part of his inheritance in founding a hospital, to which
LINE 73: was to be added a training school for nurses, and in time perhaps a
LINE 74: medical college and a school of pharmacy. He had been strongly tempted
LINE 75: to leave the South, and seek a home for his family and a career for
LINE 76: himself in the freer North, where race antagonism was less keen, or at
LINE 77: least less oppressive, or in Europe, where he had never found his color
LINE 78: work to his disadvantage. But his people had needed him, and he had
LINE 79: wished to help them, and had sought by means of this institution to
LINE 80: contribute to their uplifting. As he now informed Dr. Burns, he was
LINE 81: returning from New York, where he had been in order to purchase
LINE 82: equipment for his new hospital, which would soon be ready for the
LINE 83: reception of patients.
LINE 84: "How much I can accomplish I do not know," said Miller, "but I'll do
LINE 85: what I can. There are eight or nine million of us, and it will take a
LINE 86: great deal of learning of all kinds to leaven that lump."
LINE 87: "It is a great problem, Miller, the future of your race," returned the
LINE 88: other, "a tremendously interesting problem. It is a serial story which
LINE 89: we are all reading, and which grows in vital interest with each
LINE 90: successive installment. It is not only your problem, but ours. Your race
LINE 91: must come up or drag ours down."
LINE 92: "We shall come up," declared Miller; "slowly and painfully, perhaps, but
LINE 93: we shall win our way. If our race had made as much progress everywhere
LINE 94: as they have made in Wellington, the problem would be well on the way
LINE 95: toward solution."
LINE 96: "Wellington?" exclaimed Dr. Burns. "That's where I'm going. A Dr. Price,
LINE 97: of Wellington, has sent for me to perform an operation on a child's
LINE 98: throat. Do you know Dr. Price?"
LINE 99: "Quite well," replied Miller, "he is a friend of mine."
LINE 100: "So much the better. I shall want you to assist me. I read in the
LINE 101: Medical Gazette, the other day, an account of a very interesting
LINE 102: operation of yours. I felt proud to number you among my pupils. It was a
LINE 103: remarkable case--a rare case. I must certainly have you with me in this
LINE 104: one."
LINE 105: "I shall be delighted, sir," returned Miller, "if it is agreeable to all
LINE 106: concerned."
LINE 107: Several hours were passed in pleasant conversation while the train sped
LINE 108: rapidly southward. They were already far down in Virginia, and had
LINE 109: stopped at a station beyond Richmond, when the conductor entered the
LINE 110: car.
LINE 111: "All passengers," he announced, "will please transfer to the day coaches
LINE 112: ahead. The sleeper has a hot box, and must be switched off here."
LINE 113: Dr. Burns and Miller obeyed the order, the former leading the way into
LINE 114: the coach immediately in front of the sleeping-car.
LINE 115: "Let's sit here, Miller," he said, having selected a seat near the rear
LINE 116: of the car and deposited his suitcase in a rack. "It's on the shady
LINE 117: side."
LINE 118: Miller stood a moment hesitatingly, but finally took the seat indicated,
LINE 119: and a few minutes later the journey was again resumed.
LINE 120: When the train conductor made his round after leaving the station, he
LINE 121: paused at the seat occupied by the two doctors, glanced interrogatively
LINE 122: at Miller, and then spoke to Dr. Burns, who sat in the end of the seat
LINE 123: nearest the aisle.
LINE 124: "This man is with you?" he asked, indicating Miller with a slight side
LINE 125: movement of his head, and a keen glance in his direction.
LINE 126: "Certainly," replied Dr. Burns curtly, and with some surprise. "Don't
LINE 127: you see that he is?"
LINE 128: The conductor passed on. Miller paid no apparent attention to this
LINE 129: little interlude, though no syllable had escaped him. He resumed the
LINE 130: conversation where it had been broken off, but nevertheless followed
LINE 131: with his eyes the conductor, who stopped at a seat near the forward end
LINE 132: of the car, and engaged in conversation with a man whom Miller had not
LINE 133: hitherto noticed.
LINE 134: As this passenger turned his head and looked back toward Miller, the
LINE 135: latter saw a broad-shouldered, burly white man, and recognized in his
LINE 136: square-cut jaw, his coarse, firm mouth, and the single gray eye with
LINE 137: which he swept Miller for an instant with a scornful glance, a
LINE 138: well-known character of Wellington, with whom the reader has already
LINE 139: made acquaintance in these pages. Captain McBane wore a frock coat and a
LINE 140: slouch hat; several buttons of his vest were unbuttoned, and his
LINE 141: solitaire diamond blazed in his soiled shirt-front like the headlight of
LINE 142: a locomotive.
LINE 143: The conductor in his turn looked back at Miller, and retraced his steps.
LINE 144: Miller braced himself for what he feared was coming, though he had
LINE 145: hoped, on account of his friend's presence, that it might be avoided.
LINE 146: "Excuse me, sir," said the conductor, addressing Dr. Burns, "but did I
LINE 147: understand you to say that this man was your servant?"
LINE 148: "No, indeed!" replied Dr. Burns indignantly. "The gentleman is not my
LINE 149: servant, nor anybody's servant, but is my friend. But, by the way, since
LINE 150: we are on the subject, may I ask what affair it is of yours?"
LINE 151: "It's very much my affair," returned the conductor, somewhat nettled at
LINE 152: this questioning of his authority. "I'm sorry to part _friends_, but the
LINE 153: law of Virginia does not permit colored passengers to ride in the white
LINE 154: cars. You'll have to go forward to the next coach," he added, addressing
LINE 155: Miller this time.
LINE 156: "I have paid my fare on the sleeping-car, where the separate-car law
LINE 157: does not apply," remonstrated Miller.
LINE 158: "I can't help that. You can doubtless get your money back from the
LINE 159: sleeping-car company. But this is a day coach, and is distinctly marked
LINE 160: 'White,' as you must have seen before you sat down here. The sign is put
LINE 161: there for that purpose."
LINE 162: He indicated a large card neatly framed and hung at the end of the car,
LINE 163: containing the legend, "White," in letters about a foot long, painted in
LINE 164: white upon a dark background, typical, one might suppose, of the
LINE 165: distinction thereby indicated.
LINE 166: "You shall not stir a step, Miller," exclaimed Dr. Burns wrathfully.
LINE 167: "This is an outrage upon a citizen of a free country. You shall stay
LINE 168: right here."
LINE 169: "I'm sorry to discommode you," returned the conductor, "but there's no
LINE 170: use kicking. It's the law of Virginia, and I am bound by it as well as
LINE 171: you. I have already come near losing my place because of not enforcing
LINE 172: it, and I can take no more such chances, since I have a family to
LINE 173: support."
LINE 174: "And my friend has his rights to maintain," returned Dr. Burns with
LINE 175: determination. "There is a vital principle at stake in the matter."
LINE 176: "Really, sir," argued the conductor, who was a man of peace and not fond
LINE 177: of controversy, "there's no use talking--he absolutely cannot ride in
LINE 178: this car."
LINE 179: "How can you prevent it?" asked Dr. Burns, lapsing into the
LINE 180: argumentative stage.
LINE 181: "The law gives me the right to remove him by force. I can call on the
LINE 182: train crew to assist me, or on the other passengers. If I should choose
LINE 183: to put him off the train entirely, in the middle of a swamp, he would
LINE 184: have no redress--the law so provides. If I did not wish to use force, I
LINE 185: could simply switch this car off at the next siding, transfer the white
LINE 186: passengers to another, and leave you and your friend in possession until
LINE 187: you were arrested and fined or imprisoned."
LINE 188: "What he says is absolutely true, doctor," interposed Miller at this
LINE 189: point. "It is the law, and we are powerless to resist it. If we made any
LINE 190: trouble, it would merely delay your journey and imperil a life at the
LINE 191: other end. I'll go into the other car."
LINE 192: "You shall not go alone," said Dr. Burns stoutly, rising in his turn. "A
LINE 193: place that is too good for you is not good enough for me. I will sit
LINE 194: wherever you do."
LINE 195: "I'm sorry again," said the conductor, who had quite recovered his
LINE 196: equanimity, and calmly conscious of his power, could scarcely restrain
LINE 197: an amused smile; "I dislike to interfere, but white passengers are not
LINE 198: permitted to ride in the colored car."
LINE 199: "This is an outrage," declared Dr. Burns, "a d----d outrage! You are
LINE 200: curtailing the rights, not only of colored people, but of white men as
LINE 201: well. I shall sit where I please!"
LINE 202: "I warn you, sir," rejoined the conductor, hardening again, "that the
LINE 203: law will be enforced. The beauty of the system lies in its strict
LINE 204: impartiality--it applies to both races alike."
LINE 205: "And is equally infamous in both cases," declared Dr. Burns. "I shall
LINE 206: immediately take steps"--
LINE 207: "Never mind, doctor," interrupted Miller, soothingly, "it's only for a
LINE 208: little while. I'll reach my destination just as surely in the other car,
LINE 209: and we can't help it, anyway. I'll see you again at Wellington."
LINE 210: Dr. Burns, finding resistance futile, at length acquiesced and made way
LINE 211: for Miller to pass him.
LINE 212: The colored doctor took up his valise and crossed the platform to the
LINE 213: car ahead. It was an old car, with faded upholstery, from which the
LINE 214: stuffing projected here and there through torn places. Apparently the
LINE 215: floor had not been swept for several days. The dust lay thick upon the
LINE 216: window sills, and the water-cooler, from which he essayed to get a
LINE 217: drink, was filled with stale water which had made no recent acquaintance
LINE 218: with ice. There was no other passenger in the car, and Miller occupied
LINE 219: himself in making a rough calculation of what it would cost the Southern
LINE 220: railroads to haul a whole car for every colored passenger. It was
LINE 221: expensive, to say the least; it would be cheaper, and quite as
LINE 222: considerate of their feelings, to make the negroes walk.
LINE 223: The car was conspicuously labeled at either end with large cards,
LINE 224: similar to those in the other car, except that they bore the word
LINE 225: "Colored" in black letters upon a white background. The author of this
LINE 226: piece of legislation had contrived, with an ingenuity worthy of a better
LINE 227: cause, that not merely should the passengers be separated by the color
LINE 228: line, but that the reason for this division should be kept constantly in
LINE 229: mind. Lest a white man should forget that he was white,--not a very
LINE 230: likely contingency,--these cards would keep him constantly admonished of
LINE 231: the fact; should a colored person endeavor, for a moment, to lose sight
LINE 232: of his disability, these staring signs would remind him continually that
LINE 233: between him and the rest of mankind not of his own color, there was by
LINE 234: law a great gulf fixed.
LINE 235: Having composed himself, Miller had opened a newspaper, and was deep in
LINE 236: an editorial which set forth in glowing language the inestimable
LINE 237: advantages which would follow to certain recently acquired islands by
LINE 238: the introduction of American liberty, when the rear door of the car
LINE 239: opened to give entrance to Captain George McBane, who took a seat near
LINE 240: the door and lit a cigar. Miller knew him quite well by sight and by
LINE 241: reputation, and detested him as heartily. He represented the aggressive,
LINE 242: offensive element among the white people of the New South, who made it
LINE 243: hard for a negro to maintain his self-respect or to enjoy even the
LINE 244: rights conceded to colored men by Southern laws. McBane had undoubtedly
LINE 245: identified him to the conductor in the other car. Miller had no desire
LINE 246: to thrust himself upon the society of white people, which, indeed, to
LINE 247: one who had traveled so much and so far, was no novelty; but he very
LINE 248: naturally resented being at this late day--the law had been in operation
LINE 249: only a few months--branded and tagged and set apart from the rest of
LINE 250: mankind upon the public highways, like an unclean thing. Nevertheless,
LINE 251: he preferred even this to the exclusive society of Captain George
LINE 252: McBane.
LINE 253: "Porter," he demanded of the colored train attaché who passed through
LINE 254: the car a moment later, "is this a smoking car for white men?"
LINE 255: "No, suh," replied the porter, "but they comes in here sometimes, when
LINE 256: they ain' no cullud ladies on the kyar."
LINE 257: "Well, I have paid first-class fare, and I object to that man's smoking
LINE 258: in here. You tell him to go out."
LINE 259: "I'll tell the conductor, suh," returned the porter in a low tone. "I
LINE 260: 'd jus' as soon talk ter the devil as ter that man."
LINE 261: The white man had spread himself over two seats, and was smoking
LINE 262: vigorously, from time to time spitting carelessly in the aisle, when the
LINE 263: conductor entered the compartment.
LINE 264: "Captain," said Miller, "this car is plainly marked 'Colored.' I have
LINE 265: paid first-class fare, and I object to riding in a smoking car."
LINE 266: "All right," returned the conductor, frowning irritably. "I'll speak to
LINE 267: him."
LINE 268: He walked over to the white passenger, with whom he was evidently
LINE 269: acquainted, since he addressed him by name.
LINE 270: "Captain McBane," he said, "it's against the law for you to ride in the
LINE 271: nigger car."
LINE 272: "Who are you talkin' to?" returned the other. "I'll ride where I damn
LINE 273: please."
LINE 274: "Yes, sir, but the colored passenger objects. I'm afraid I'll have to
LINE 275: ask you to go into the smoking-car."
LINE 276: "The hell you say!" rejoined McBane. "I'll leave this car when I get
LINE 277: good and ready, and that won't be till I've finished this cigar. See?"
LINE 278: He was as good as his word. The conductor escaped from the car before
LINE 279: Miller had time for further expostulation. Finally McBane, having thrown
LINE 280: the stump of his cigar into the aisle and added to the floor a finishing
LINE 281: touch in the way of expectoration, rose and went back into the white
LINE 282: car.
LINE 283: Left alone in his questionable glory, Miller buried himself again in his
LINE 284: newspaper, from which he did not look up until the engine stopped at a
LINE 285: tank station to take water.
LINE 286: As the train came to a standstill, a huge negro, covered thickly with
LINE 287: dust, crawled off one of the rear trucks unobserved, and ran round the
LINE 288: rear end of the car to a watering-trough by a neighboring well. Moved
LINE 289: either by extreme thirst or by the fear that his time might be too short
LINE 290: to permit him to draw a bucket of water, he threw himself down by the
LINE 291: trough, drank long and deep, and plunging his head into the water, shook
LINE 292: himself like a wet dog, and crept furtively back to his dangerous perch.
LINE 293: Miller, who had seen this man from the car window, had noticed a very
LINE 294: singular thing. As the dusty tramp passed the rear coach, he cast toward
LINE 295: it a glance of intense ferocity. Up to that moment the man's face, which
LINE 296: Miller had recognized under its grimy coating, had been that of an
LINE 297: ordinarily good-natured, somewhat reckless, pleasure-loving negro, at
LINE 298: present rather the worse for wear. The change that now came over it
LINE 299: suggested a concentrated hatred almost uncanny in its murderousness.
LINE 300: With awakened curiosity Miller followed the direction of the negro's
LINE 301: glance, and saw that it rested upon a window where Captain McBane sat
LINE 302: looking out. When Miller looked back, the negro had disappeared.
LINE 303: At the next station a Chinaman, of the ordinary laundry type, boarded
LINE 304: the train, and took his seat in the white car without objection. At
LINE 305: another point a colored nurse found a place with her mistress.
LINE 306: "White people," said Miller to himself, who had seen these passengers
LINE 307: from the window, "do not object to the negro as a servant. As the
LINE 308: traditional negro,--the servant,--he is welcomed; as an equal, he is
LINE 309: repudiated."
LINE 310: Miller was something of a philosopher. He had long ago had the
LINE 311: conclusion forced upon him that an educated man of his race, in order to
LINE 312: live comfortably in the United States, must be either a philosopher or
LINE 313: a fool; and since he wished to be happy, and was not exactly a fool, he
LINE 314: had cultivated philosophy. By and by he saw a white man, with a dog,
LINE 315: enter the rear coach. Miller wondered whether the dog would be allowed
LINE 316: to ride with his master, and if not, what disposition would be made of
LINE 317: him. He was a handsome dog, and Miller, who was fond of animals, would
LINE 318: not have objected to the company of a dog, as a dog. He was nevertheless
LINE 319: conscious of a queer sensation when he saw the porter take the dog by
LINE 320: the collar and start in his own direction, and felt consciously relieved
LINE 321: when the canine passenger was taken on past him into the baggage-car
LINE 322: ahead. Miller's hand was hanging over the arm of his seat, and the dog,
LINE 323: an intelligent shepherd, licked it as he passed. Miller was not entirely
LINE 324: sure that he would not have liked the porter to leave the dog there; he
LINE 325: was a friendly dog, and seemed inclined to be sociable.
LINE 326: Toward evening the train drew up at a station where quite a party of
LINE 327: farm laborers, fresh from their daily toil, swarmed out from the
LINE 328: conspicuously labeled colored waiting-room, and into the car with
LINE 329: Miller. They were a jolly, good-natured crowd, and, free from the
LINE 330: embarrassing presence of white people, proceeded to enjoy themselves
LINE 331: after their own fashion. Here an amorous fellow sat with his arm around
LINE 332: a buxom girl's waist. A musically inclined individual--his talents did
LINE 333: not go far beyond inclination--produced a mouth-organ and struck up a
LINE 334: tune, to which a limber-legged boy danced in the aisle. They were noisy,
LINE 335: loquacious, happy, dirty, and malodorous. For a while Miller was amused
LINE 336: and pleased. They were his people, and he felt a certain expansive
LINE 337: warmth toward them in spite of their obvious shortcomings. By and by,
LINE 338: however, the air became too close, and he went out upon the platform.
LINE 339: For the sake of the democratic ideal, which meant so much to his race,
LINE 340: he might have endured the affliction. He could easily imagine that
LINE 341: people of refinement, with the power in their hands, might be tempted to
LINE 342: strain the democratic ideal in order to avoid such contact; but
LINE 343: personally, and apart from the mere matter of racial sympathy, these
LINE 344: people were just as offensive to him as to the whites in the other end
LINE 345: of the train. Surely, if a classification of passengers on trains was at
LINE 346: all desirable, it might be made upon some more logical and considerate
LINE 347: basis than a mere arbitrary, tactless, and, by the very nature of
LINE 348: things, brutal drawing of a color line. It was a veritable bed of
LINE 349: Procrustes, this standard which the whites had set for the negroes.
LINE 350: Those who grew above it must have their heads cut off, figuratively
LINE 351: speaking,--must be forced back to the level assigned to their race;
LINE 352: those who fell beneath the standard set had their necks stretched,
LINE 353: literally enough, as the ghastly record in the daily papers gave
LINE 354: conclusive evidence.
LINE 355: Miller breathed more freely when the lively crowd got off at the next
LINE 356: station, after a short ride. Moreover, he had a light heart, a
LINE 357: conscience void of offense, and was only thirty years old. His
LINE 358: philosophy had become somewhat jaded on this journey, but he pulled it
LINE 359: together for a final effort. Was it not, after all, a wise provision of
LINE 360: nature that had given to a race, destined to a long servitude and a slow
LINE 361: emergence therefrom, a cheerfulness of spirit which enabled them to
LINE 362: catch pleasure on the wing, and endure with equanimity the ills that
LINE 363: seemed inevitable? The ability to live and thrive under adverse
LINE 364: circumstances is the surest guaranty of the future. The race which at
LINE 365: the last shall inherit the earth--the residuary legatee of
LINE 366: civilization--will be the race which remains longest upon it. The negro
LINE 367: was here before the Anglo-Saxon was evolved, and his thick lips and
LINE 368: heavy-lidded eyes looked out from the inscrutable face of the Sphinx
LINE 369: across the sands of Egypt while yet the ancestors of those who now
LINE 370: oppress him were living in caves, practicing human sacrifice, and
LINE 371: painting themselves with woad--and the negro is here yet.
LINE 372: "'Blessed are the meek,'" quoted Miller at the end of these consoling
LINE 373: reflections, "'for they shall inherit the earth.' If this be true, the
LINE 374: negro may yet come into his estate, for meekness seems to be set apart
LINE 375: as his portion."
LINE 376: The journey came to an end just as the sun had sunk into the west.
LINE 377: Simultaneously with Miller's exit from the train, a great black figure
LINE 378: crawled off the trucks of the rear car, on the side opposite the station
LINE 379: platform. Stretching and shaking himself with a free gesture, the black
