LINE 1: The young heir of the Carterets had thriven apace, and at six months old
LINE 2: was, according to Mammy Jane, whose experience qualified her to speak
LINE 3: with authority, the largest, finest, smartest, and altogether most
LINE 4: remarkable baby that had ever lived in Wellington. Mammy Jane had
LINE 5: recently suffered from an attack of inflammatory rheumatism, as the
LINE 6: result of which she had returned to her own home. She nevertheless came
LINE 7: now and then to see Mrs. Carteret. A younger nurse had been procured to
LINE 8: take her place, but it was understood that Jane would come whenever she
LINE 9: might be needed.
LINE 10: "You really mean that about Dodie, do you, Mammy Jane?" asked the
LINE 11: delighted mother, who never tired of hearing her own opinion confirmed
LINE 12: concerning this wonderful child, which had come to her like an angel
LINE 13: from heaven.
LINE 14: "Does I mean it!" exclaimed Mammy Jane, with a tone and an expression
LINE 15: which spoke volumes of reproach. "Now, Mis' 'Livy, what is I ever
LINE 16: uttered er said er spoke er done dat would make you s'pose I could tell
LINE 17: you a lie 'bout yo' own chile?"
LINE 18: "No, Mammy Jane, I'm sure you wouldn't."
LINE 19: "'Deed, ma'am, I'm tellin' you de Lawd's truf. I don' haf ter tell no
LINE 20: lies ner strain no p'ints 'bout my ole mist'ess's gran'chile. Dis yer
LINE 21: boy is de ve'y spit an' image er yo' brother, young Mars Alick, w'at
LINE 22: died w'en he wuz 'bout eight mont's ole, w'iles I wuz laid off havin' a
LINE 23: baby er my own, an' couldn' be roun' ter look after 'im. An' dis chile
LINE 24: is a rale quality chile, he is,--I never seed a baby wid sech fine hair
LINE 25: fer his age, ner sech blue eyes, ner sech a grip, ner sech a heft. W'y,
LINE 26: dat chile mus' weigh 'bout twenty-fo' poun's, an' he not but six mont's
LINE 27: ole. Does dat gal w'at does de nussin' w'iles I'm gone ten' ter dis
LINE 28: chile right, Mis' 'Livy?"
LINE 29: "She does fairly well, Mammy Jane, but I could hardly expect her to love
LINE 30: the baby as you do. There's no one like you, Mammy Jane."
LINE 31: "'Deed dere ain't, honey; you is talkin' de gospel truf now! None er
LINE 32: dese yer young folks ain' got de trainin' my ole mist'ess give me. Dese
LINE 33: yer new-fangle' schools don' l'arn 'em nothin' ter compare wid it. I'm
LINE 34: jes' gwine ter give dat gal a piece er my min', befo' I go, so she'll
LINE 35: ten' ter dis chile right."
LINE 36: The nurse came in shortly afterwards, a neat-looking brown girl, dressed
LINE 37: in a clean calico gown, with a nurse's cap and apron.
LINE 38: "Look a-here, gal," said Mammy Jane sternly, "I wants you ter understan'
LINE 39: dat you got ter take good keer er dis chile; fer I nussed his mammy
LINE 40: dere, an' his gran'mammy befo' 'im, an' you is got a priv'lege dat mos'
LINE 41: lackly you don' 'preciate. I wants you to 'member, in yo' incomin's an'
LINE 42: outgoin's, dat I got my eye on you, an' am gwine ter see dat you does
LINE 43: yo' wo'k right."
LINE 44: "Do you need me for anything, ma'am?" asked the young nurse, who had
LINE 45: stood before Mrs. Carteret, giving Mammy Jane a mere passing glance, and
LINE 46: listening impassively to her harangue. The nurse belonged to the
LINE 47: younger generation of colored people. She had graduated from the mission
LINE 48: school, and had received some instruction in Dr. Miller's class for
LINE 49: nurses. Standing, like most young people of her race, on the border line
LINE 50: between two irreconcilable states of life, she had neither the
LINE 51: picturesqueness of the slave, nor the unconscious dignity of those of
LINE 52: whom freedom has been the immemorial birthright; she was in what might
LINE 53: be called the chip-on-the-shoulder stage, through which races as well as
LINE 54: individuals must pass in climbing the ladder of life,--not an
LINE 55: interesting, at least not an agreeable stage, but an inevitable one, and
LINE 56: for that reason entitled to a paragraph in a story of Southern life,
LINE 57: which, with its as yet imperfect blending of old with new, of race with
LINE 58: race, of slavery with freedom, is like no other life under the sun.
LINE 59: Had this old woman, who had no authority over her, been a little more
LINE 60: polite, or a little less offensive, the nurse might have returned her a
LINE 61: pleasant answer. These old-time negroes, she said to herself, made her
LINE 62: sick with their slavering over the white folks, who, she supposed,
LINE 63: favored them and made much of them because they had once belonged to
LINE 64: them,--much the same reason why they fondled their cats and dogs. For
LINE 65: her own part, they gave her nothing but her wages, and small wages at
LINE 66: that, and she owed them nothing more than equivalent service. It was
LINE 67: purely a matter of business; she sold her time for their money. There
LINE 68: was no question of love between them.
LINE 69: Receiving a negative answer from Mrs. Carteret, she left the room
LINE 70: without a word, ignoring Mammy Jane completely, and leaving that
LINE 71: venerable relic of ante-bellum times gasping in helpless astonishment.
LINE 72: "Well, I nevuh!" she ejaculated, as soon as she could get her breath,
LINE 73: "ef dat ain' de beatinis' pe'fo'mance I ever seed er heared of! Dese yer
LINE 74: young niggers ain' got de manners dey wuz bawned wid! I don' know w'at
LINE 75: dey're comin' to, w'en dey ain' got no mo' rispec' fer ole age--I don'
LINE 76: know--I don' know!"
LINE 77: "Now what are you croaking about, Jane?" asked Major Carteret, who came
LINE 78: into the room and took the child into his arms.
LINE 79: Mammy Jane hobbled to her feet and bobbed a curtsy. She was never
LINE 80: lacking in respect to white people of proper quality; but Major
LINE 81: Carteret, the quintessence of aristocracy, called out all her reserves
LINE 82: of deference. The major was always kind and considerate to these old
LINE 83: family retainers, brought up in the feudal atmosphere now so rapidly
LINE 84: passing away. Mammy Jane loved Mrs. Carteret; toward the major she
LINE 85: entertained a feeling bordering upon awe.
LINE 86: "Well, Jane," returned the major sadly, when the old nurse had related
LINE 87: her grievance, "the old times have vanished, the old ties have been
LINE 88: ruptured. The old relations of dependence and loyal obedience on the
LINE 89: part of the colored people, the responsibility of protection and
LINE 90: kindness upon that of the whites, have passed away forever. The young
LINE 91: negroes are too self-assertive. Education is spoiling them, Jane; they
LINE 92: have been badly taught. They are not content with their station in life.
LINE 93: Some time they will overstep the mark. The white people are patient, but
LINE 94: there is a limit to their endurance."
LINE 95: "Dat's w'at I tells dese young niggers," groaned Mammy Jane, with a
LINE 96: portentous shake of her turbaned head, "w'en I hears 'em gwine on wid
LINE 97: deir foolishniss; but dey don' min' me. Dey 'lows dey knows mo' d'n I
LINE 98: does, 'ca'se dey be'n l'arnt ter look in a book. But, pshuh! my ole
LINE 99: mist'ess showed me mo' d'n dem niggers 'll l'arn in a thousan' years! I
LINE 100: 's fetch' my gran'son' Jerry up ter be 'umble, an' keep in 'is place.
LINE 101: An' I tells dese other niggers dat ef dey'd do de same, an' not crowd
LINE 102: de w'ite folks, dey'd git ernuff ter eat, an' live out deir days in
LINE 103: peace an' comfo't. But dey don' min' me--dey don' min' me!"
LINE 104: "If all the colored people were like you and Jerry, Jane," rejoined the
LINE 105: major kindly, "there would never be any trouble. You have friends upon
LINE 106: whom, in time of need, you can rely implicitly for protection and
LINE 107: succor. You served your mistress faithfully before the war; you remained
LINE 108: by her when the other negroes were running hither and thither like sheep
LINE 109: without a shepherd; and you have transferred your allegiance to my wife
LINE 110: and her child. We think a great deal of you, Jane."
LINE 111: "Yes, indeed, Mammy Jane," assented Mrs. Carteret, with sincere
LINE 112: affection, glancing with moist eyes from the child in her husband's arms
LINE 113: to the old nurse, whose dark face was glowing with happiness at these
LINE 114: expressions of appreciation, "you shall never want so long as we have
LINE 115: anything. We would share our last crust with you."
LINE 116: "Thank y', Mis' 'Livy," said Jane with reciprocal emotion, "I knows who
LINE 117: my frien's is, an' I ain' gwine ter let nothin' worry me. But fer de
LINE 118: Lawd's sake, Mars Philip, gimme dat chile, an' lemme pat 'im on de back,
LINE 119: er he'll choke hisse'f ter death!"
LINE 120: The old nurse had been the first to observe that little Dodie, for some
LINE 121: reason, was gasping for breath. Catching the child from the major's
LINE 122: arms, she patted it on the back, and shook it gently. After a moment of
LINE 123: this treatment, the child ceased to gasp, but still breathed heavily,
LINE 124: with a strange, whistling noise.
LINE 125: "Oh, my child!" exclaimed the mother, in great alarm, taking the baby in
LINE 126: her own arms, "what can be the matter with him, Mammy Jane?"
LINE 127: "Fer de Lawd's sake, ma'am, I don' know, 'less he's swallered
LINE 128: somethin'; an' he ain' had nothin' in his han's but de rattle Mis' Polly
LINE 129: give 'im."
LINE 130: Mrs. Carteret caught up the ivory rattle, which hung suspended by a
LINE 131: ribbon from the baby's neck.
LINE 132: "He has swallowed the little piece off the end of the handle," she
LINE 133: cried, turning pale with fear, "and it has lodged in his throat.
LINE 134: Telephone Dr. Price to come immediately, Philip, before my baby chokes
LINE 135: to death! Oh, my baby, my precious baby!"
LINE 136: An anxious half hour passed, during which the child lay quiet, except
LINE 137: for its labored breathing. The suspense was relieved by the arrival of
LINE 138: Dr. Price, who examined the child carefully.
LINE 139: "It's a curious accident," he announced at the close of his inspection.
LINE 140: "So far as I can discover, the piece of ivory has been drawn into the
LINE 141: trachea, or windpipe, and has lodged in the mouth of the right bronchus.
LINE 142: I'll try to get it out without an operation, but I can't guarantee the
LINE 143: result."
LINE 144: At the end of another half hour Dr. Price announced his inability to
LINE 145: remove the obstruction without resorting to more serious measures.
LINE 146: "I do not see," he declared, "how an operation can be avoided."
LINE 147: "Will it be dangerous?" inquired the major anxiously, while Mrs.
LINE 148: Carteret shivered at the thought.
LINE 149: "It will be necessary to cut into his throat from the outside. All such
LINE 150: operations are more or less dangerous, especially on small children. If
LINE 151: this were some other child, I might undertake the operation unassisted;
LINE 152: but I know how you value this one, major, and I should prefer to share
LINE 153: the responsibility with a specialist."
LINE 154: "Is there one in town?" asked the major.
LINE 155: "No, but we can get one from out of town."
LINE 156: "Send for the best one in the country," said the major, "who can be got
LINE 157: here in time. Spare no expense, Dr. Price. We value this child above any
LINE 158: earthly thing."
LINE 159: "The best is the safest," replied Dr. Price. "I will send for Dr. Burns,
LINE 160: of Philadelphia, the best surgeon in that line in America. If he can
LINE 161: start at once, he can reach here in sixteen or eighteen hours, and the
LINE 162: case can wait even longer, if inflammation does not set in."
LINE 163: The message was dispatched forthwith. By rare good fortune the eminent
LINE 164: specialist was able to start within an hour or two after the receipt of
LINE 165: Dr. Price's telegram. Meanwhile the baby remained restless and uneasy,
LINE 166: the doctor spending most of his time by its side. Mrs. Carteret, who had
LINE 167: never been quite strong since the child's birth, was a prey to the most
LINE 168: agonizing apprehensions.
LINE 169: Mammy Jane, while not presuming to question the opinion of Dr. Price,
LINE 170: and not wishing to add to her mistress's distress, was secretly
LINE 171: oppressed by forebodings which she was unable to shake off. The child
LINE 172: was born for bad luck. The mole under its ear, just at the point where
LINE 173: the hangman's knot would strike, had foreshadowed dire misfortune. She
LINE 174: had already observed several little things which had rendered her
LINE 175: vaguely anxious.
LINE 176: For instance, upon one occasion, on entering the room where the baby had
LINE 177: been left alone, asleep in his crib, she had met a strange cat hurrying
LINE 178: from the nursery, and, upon examining closely the pillow upon which the
LINE 179: child lay, had found a depression which had undoubtedly been due to the
LINE 180: weight of the cat's body. The child was restless and uneasy, and Jane
LINE 181: had ever since believed that the cat had been sucking little Dodie's
LINE 182: breath, with what might have been fatal results had she not appeared
LINE 183: just in the nick of time.
LINE 184: This untimely accident of the rattle, a fatality for which no one could
LINE 185: be held responsible, had confirmed the unlucky omen. Jane's duties in
LINE 186: the nursery did not permit her to visit her friend the conjure woman;
LINE 187: but she did find time to go out in the back yard at dusk, and to dig up
LINE 188: the charm which she had planted there. It had protected the child so
LINE 189: far; but perhaps its potency had become exhausted. She picked up the
LINE 190: bottle, shook it vigorously, and then laid it back, with the other side
LINE 191: up. Refilling the hole, she made a cross over the top with the thumb of
LINE 192: her left hand, and walked three times around it.
LINE 193: What this strange symbolism meant, or whence it derived its origin, Aunt
LINE 194: Jane did not know. The cross was there, and the Trinity, though Jane was
LINE 195: scarcely conscious of these, at this moment, as religious emblems. But
LINE 196: she hoped, on general principles, that this performance would strengthen
LINE 197: the charm and restore little Dodie's luck. It certainly had its moral
LINE 198: effect upon Jane's own mind, for she was able to sleep better, and
LINE 199: contrived to impress Mrs. Carteret with her own hopefulness.
