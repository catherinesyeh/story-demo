LINE 1: One morning shortly after the opening of the hospital, while Dr. Miller
LINE 2: was making his early rounds, a new patient walked in with a smile on his
LINE 3: face and a broken arm hanging limply by his side. Miller recognized in
LINE 4: him a black giant by the name of Josh Green, who for many years had
LINE 5: worked on the docks for Miller's father,--and simultaneously identified
LINE 6: him as the dust-begrimed negro who had stolen a ride to Wellington on
LINE 7: the trucks of a passenger car.
LINE 8: "Well, Josh," asked the doctor, as he examined the fracture, "how did
LINE 9: you get this? Been fighting again?"
LINE 10: "No, suh, I don' s'pose you could ha'dly call it a fight. One er dem
LINE 11: dagoes off'n a Souf American boat gimme some er his jaw, an' I give 'im
LINE 12: a back answer, an' here I is wid a broken arm. He got holt er a
LINE 13: belayin'-pin befo' I could hit 'im."
LINE 14: "What became of the other man?" demanded Miller suspiciously. He
LINE 15: perceived, from the indifference with which Josh bore the manipulation
LINE 16: of the fractured limb, that such an accident need not have interfered
LINE 17: seriously with the use of the remaining arm, and he knew that Josh had a
LINE 18: reputation for absolute fearlessness.
LINE 19: "Lemme see," said Josh reflectively, "ef I kin 'member w'at _did_ become
LINE 20: er him! Oh, yes, I 'member now! Dey tuck him ter de Marine Horspittle
LINE 21: in de amberlance, 'cause his leg wuz broke, an' I reckon somethin' must
LINE 22: 'a' accident'ly hit 'im in de jaw, fer he wuz scatt'rin' teeth all de
LINE 23: way 'long de street. I didn' wan' ter kill de man, fer he might have
LINE 24: somebody dependin' on 'im, an' I knows how dat'd be ter dem. But no man
LINE 25: kin call me a damn' low-down nigger and keep on enjoyin' good health
LINE 26: right along."
LINE 27: "It was considerate of you to spare his life," said Miller dryly, "but
LINE 28: you'll hit the wrong man some day. These are bad times for bad negroes.
LINE 29: You'll get into a quarrel with a white man, and at the end of it there'll
LINE 30: be a lynching, or a funeral. You'd better be peaceable and endure a
LINE 31: little injustice, rather than run the risk of a sudden and violent
LINE 32: death."
LINE 33: "I expec's ter die a vi'lent death in a quarrel wid a w'ite man,"
LINE 34: replied Josh, in a matter-of-fact tone, "an' fu'thermo', he's gwine ter
LINE 35: die at the same time, er a little befo'. I be'n takin' my own time 'bout
LINE 36: killin' 'im; I ain' be'n crowdin' de man, but I'll be ready after a
LINE 37: w'ile, an' den he kin look out!"
LINE 38: "And I suppose you're merely keeping in practice on these other fellows
LINE 39: who come your way. When I get your arm dressed, you'd better leave town
LINE 40: till that fellow's boat sails; it may save you the expense of a trial
LINE 41: and three months in the chain-gang. But this talk about killing a man is
LINE 42: all nonsense. What has any man in this town done to you, that you should
LINE 43: thirst for his blood?"
LINE 44: "No, suh, it ain' nonsense,--it's straight, solem' fac'. I'm gwine ter
LINE 45: kill dat man as sho' as I'm settin' in dis cheer; an' dey ain' nobody
LINE 46: kin say I ain' got a right ter kill 'im. Does you 'member de Ku-Klux?"
LINE 47: "Yes, but I was a child at the time, and recollect very little about
LINE 48: them. It is a page of history which most people are glad to forget."
LINE 49: "Yas, suh; I was a chile, too, but I wuz right in it, an' so I 'members
LINE 50: mo' erbout it 'n you does. My mammy an' daddy lived 'bout ten miles f'm
LINE 51: here, up de river. One night a crowd er w'ite men come ter ou' house an'
LINE 52: tuck my daddy out an' shot 'im ter death, an' skeered my mammy so she
LINE 53: ain' be'n herse'f f'm dat day ter dis. I wa'n't mo' 'n ten years ole at
LINE 54: de time, an' w'en my mammy seed de w'ite men comin', she tol' me ter
LINE 55: run. I hid in de bushes an' seen de whole thing, an' it wuz branded on
LINE 56: my mem'ry, suh, like a red-hot iron bran's de skin. De w'ite folks had
LINE 57: masks on, but one of 'em fell off,--he wuz de boss, he wuz de head man,
LINE 58: an' tol' de res' w'at ter do,--an' I seen his face. It wuz a easy face
LINE 59: ter 'member; an' I swo' den, 'way down deep in my hea't, little ez I
LINE 60: wuz, dat some day er 'nother I'd kill dat man. I ain't never had no
LINE 61: doubt erbout it; it's jus' w'at I'm livin' fer, an' I know I ain' gwine
LINE 62: ter die till I've done it. Some lives fer one thing an' some fer
LINE 63: another, but dat's my job. I ain' be'n in no has'e, fer I'm not ole
LINE 64: yit, an' dat man is in good health. I'd like ter see a little er de
LINE 65: worl' befo' I takes chances on leavin' it sudden; an', mo'over,
LINE 66: somebody's got ter take keer er de ole 'oman. But her time'll come some
LINE 67: er dese days, an den _his_ time'll be come--an' prob'ly mine. But I
LINE 68: ain' keerin' 'bout myse'f: w'en I git thoo wid him, it won' make no
LINE 69: diff'ence 'bout me."
LINE 70: Josh was evidently in dead earnest. Miller recalled, very vividly, the
LINE 71: expression he had seen twice on his patient's face, during the journey
LINE 72: to Wellington.
LINE 73: He had often seen Josh's mother, old Aunt Milly,--"Silly Milly," the
LINE 74: children called her,--wandering aimlessly about the street, muttering to
LINE 75: herself incoherently. He had felt a certain childish awe at the sight of
LINE 76: one of God's creatures who had lost the light of reason, and he had
LINE 77: always vaguely understood that she was the victim of human cruelty,
LINE 78: though he had dated it farther back into the past. This was his first
LINE 79: knowledge of the real facts of the case.
LINE 80: He realized, too, for a moment, the continuity of life, how inseparably
LINE 81: the present is woven with the past, how certainly the future will be but
LINE 82: the outcome of the present. He had supposed this old wound healed. The
LINE 83: negroes were not a vindictive people. If, swayed by passion or emotion,
LINE 84: they sometimes gave way to gusts of rage, these were of brief duration.
LINE 85: Absorbed in the contemplation of their doubtful present and their
LINE 86: uncertain future, they gave little thought to the past,--it was a dark
LINE 87: story, which they would willingly forget. He knew the timeworn
LINE 88: explanation that the Ku-Klux movement, in the main, was merely an
LINE 89: ebullition of boyish spirits, begun to amuse young white men by playing
LINE 90: upon the fears and superstitions of ignorant negroes. Here, however, was
LINE 91: its tragic side,--the old wound still bleeding, the fruit of one
LINE 92: tragedy, the seed of another. He could not approve of Josh's application
LINE 93: of the Mosaic law of revenge, and yet the incident was not without
LINE 94: significance. Here was a negro who could remember an injury, who could
LINE 95: shape his life to a definite purpose, if not a high or holy one. When
LINE 96: his race reached the point where they would resent a wrong, there was
LINE 97: hope that they might soon attain the stage where they would try, and, if
LINE 98: need be, die, to defend a right. This man, too, had a purpose in life,
LINE 99: and was willing to die that he might accomplish it. Miller was willing
LINE 100: to give up his life to a cause. Would he be equally willing, he asked
LINE 101: himself, to die for it? Miller had no prophetic instinct to tell him how
LINE 102: soon he would have the opportunity to answer his own question. But he
LINE 103: could not encourage Josh to carry out this dark and revengeful purpose.
LINE 104: Every worthy consideration required him to dissuade his patient from
LINE 105: such a desperate course.
LINE 106: "You had better put away these murderous fancies, Josh," he said
LINE 107: seriously. "The Bible says that we should 'forgive our enemies, bless
LINE 108: them that curse us, and do good to them that despitefully use us.'"
LINE 109: "Yas, suh, I've l'arnt all dat in Sunday-school, an' I've heared de
LINE 110: preachers say it time an' time ag'in. But it 'pears ter me dat dis
LINE 111: fergitfulniss an' fergivniss is mighty one-sided. De w'ite folks don'
LINE 112: fergive nothin' de niggers does. Dey got up de Ku-Klux, dey said, on
LINE 113: 'count er de kyarpit-baggers. Dey be'n talkin' 'bout de kyarpit-baggers
LINE 114: ever sence, an' dey 'pears ter fergot all 'bout de Ku-Klux. But I ain'
LINE 115: fergot. De niggers is be'n train' ter fergiveniss; an' fer fear dey
LINE 116: might fergit how ter fergive, de w'ite folks gives 'em somethin' new
LINE 117: ev'y now an' den, ter practice on. A w'ite man kin do w'at he wants ter
LINE 118: a nigger, but de minute de nigger gits back at 'im, up goes de nigger,
LINE 119: an' don' come down tell somebody cuts 'im down. If a nigger gits a'
LINE 120: office, er de race 'pears ter be prosperin' too much, de w'ite folks up
LINE 121: an' kills a few, so dat de res' kin keep on fergivin' an' bein' thankful
LINE 122: dat dey're lef alive. Don' talk ter me 'bout dese w'ite folks,--I knows
LINE 123: 'em, I does! Ef a nigger wants ter git down on his marrow-bones, an' eat
LINE 124: dirt, an' call 'em 'marster,' _he's_ a good nigger, dere's room fer
LINE 125: _him_. But I ain' no w'ite folks' nigger, I ain'. I don' call no man
LINE 126: 'marster.' I don' wan' nothin' but w'at I wo'k fer, but I wants all er
LINE 127: dat. I never moles's no w'ite man, 'less 'n he moles's me fus'. But w'en
LINE 128: de ole 'oman dies, doctuh, an' I gits a good chance at dat w'ite
LINE 129: man,--dere ain' no use talkin', suh!--dere's gwine ter be a mix-up, an'
LINE 130: a fune'al, er two fune'als--er may be mo', ef anybody is keerliss enough
LINE 131: to git in de way."
LINE 132: "Josh," said the doctor, laying a cool hand on the other's brow, "you
LINE 133: 're feverish, and don't know what you're talking about. I shouldn't
LINE 134: let my mind dwell on such things, and you must keep quiet until this arm
LINE 135: is well, or you may never be able to hit any one with it again."
LINE 136: Miller determined that when Josh got better he would talk to him
LINE 137: seriously and dissuade him from this dangerous design. He had not asked
LINE 138: the name of Josh's enemy, but the look of murderous hate which the
LINE 139: dust-begrimed tramp of the railway journey had cast at Captain George
LINE 140: McBane rendered any such question superfluous. McBane was probably
LINE 141: deserving of any evil fate which might befall him; but such a revenge
LINE 142: would do no good, would right no wrong; while every such crime,
LINE 143: committed by a colored man, would be imputed to the race, which was
LINE 144: already staggering under a load of obloquy because, in the eyes of a
LINE 145: prejudiced and undiscriminating public, it must answer as a whole for
LINE 146: the offenses of each separate individual. To die in defense of the right
LINE 147: was heroic. To kill another for revenge was pitifully human and weak:
LINE 148: "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," saith the Lord.
