LINE 1: Mrs. Carteret was very much disturbed. It was supposed that the shock of
LINE 2: her aunt's death had affected her health, for since that event she had
LINE 3: fallen into a nervous condition which gave the major grave concern. Much
LINE 4: to the general surprise, Mrs. Ochiltree had left no will, and no
LINE 5: property of any considerable value except her homestead, which descended
LINE 6: to Mrs. Carteret as the natural heir. Whatever she may have had on hand
LINE 7: in the way of ready money had undoubtedly been abstracted from the cedar
LINE 8: chest by the midnight marauder, to whose visit her death was immediately
LINE 9: due. Her niece's grief was held to mark a deep-seated affection for the
LINE 10: grim old woman who had reared her.
LINE 11: Mrs. Carteret's present state of mind, of which her nervousness was a
LINE 12: sufficiently accurate reflection, did in truth date from her aunt's
LINE 13: death, and also in part from the time of the conversation with Mrs.
LINE 14: Ochiltree, one afternoon, during and after the drive past Miller's new
LINE 15: hospital. Mrs. Ochiltree had grown steadily more and more childish after
LINE 16: that time, and her niece had never succeeded in making her pick up the
LINE 17: thread of thought where it had been dropped. At any rate, Mrs. Ochiltree
LINE 18: had made no further disclosure upon the subject.
LINE 19: An examination, not long after her aunt's death, of the papers found
LINE 20: near the cedar chest on the morning after the murder had contributed to
LINE 21: Mrs. Carteret's enlightenment, but had not promoted her peace of mind.
LINE 22: When Mrs. Carteret reached home, after her hurried exploration of the
LINE 23: cedar chest, she thrust into a bureau drawer the envelope she had found.
LINE 24: So fully was her mind occupied, for several days, with the funeral, and
LINE 25: with the excitement attending the arrest of Sandy Campbell, that she
LINE 26: deferred the examination of the contents of the envelope until near the
LINE 27: end of the week.
LINE 28: One morning, while alone in her chamber, she drew the envelope from the
LINE 29: drawer, and was holding it in her hand, hesitating as to whether or not
LINE 30: she should open it, when the baby in the next room began to cry.
LINE 31: The child's cry seemed like a warning, and yielding to a vague
LINE 32: uneasiness, she put the paper back.
LINE 33: "Phil," she said to her husband at luncheon, "Aunt Polly said some
LINE 34: strange things to me one day before she died,--I don't know whether she
LINE 35: was quite in her right mind or not; but suppose that my father had left
LINE 36: a will by which it was provided that half his property should go to that
LINE 37: woman and her child?"
LINE 38: "It would never have gone by such a will," replied the major easily.
LINE 39: "Your Aunt Polly was in her dotage, and merely dreaming. Your father
LINE 40: would never have been such a fool; but even if he had, no such will
LINE 41: could have stood the test of the courts. It would clearly have been due
LINE 42: to the improper influence of a designing woman."
LINE 43: "So that legally, as well as morally," said Mrs. Carteret, "the will
LINE 44: would have been of no effect?"
LINE 45: "Not the slightest. A jury would soon have broken down the legal claim.
LINE 46: As for any moral obligation, there would have been nothing moral about
LINE 47: the affair. The only possible consideration for such a gift was an
LINE 48: immoral one. I don't wish to speak harshly of your father, my dear,
LINE 49: but his conduct was gravely reprehensible. The woman herself had no
LINE 50: right or claim whatever; she would have been whipped and expelled from
LINE 51: the town, if justice--blind, bleeding justice, then prostrate at the
LINE 52: feet of slaves and aliens--could have had her way!"
LINE 53: "But the child"--
LINE 54: "The child was in the same category. Who was she, to have inherited the
LINE 55: estate of your ancestors, of which, a few years before, she would
LINE 56: herself have formed a part? The child of shame, it was hers to pay the
LINE 57: penalty. But the discussion is all in the air, Olivia. Your father never
LINE 58: did and never would have left such a will."
LINE 59: This conversation relieved Mrs. Carteret's uneasiness. Going to her room
LINE 60: shortly afterwards, she took the envelope from her bureau drawer and
LINE 61: drew out a bulky paper. The haunting fear that it might be such a will
LINE 62: as her aunt had suggested was now removed; for such an instrument, in
LINE 63: the light of what her husband had said confirming her own intuitions,
LINE 64: would be of no valid effect. It might be just as well, she thought, to
LINE 65: throw the paper in the fire without looking at it. She wished to think
LINE 66: as well as might be of her father, and she felt that her respect for his
LINE 67: memory would not be strengthened by the knowledge that he had meant to
LINE 68: leave his estate away from her; for her aunt's words had been open to
LINE 69: the construction that she was to have been left destitute. Curiosity
LINE 70: strongly prompted her to read the paper. Perhaps the will contained no
LINE 71: such provision as she had feared, and it might convey some request or
LINE 72: direction which ought properly to be complied with.
LINE 73: She had been standing in front of the bureau while these thoughts passed
LINE 74: through her mind, and now, dropping the envelope back into the drawer
LINE 75: mechanically, she unfolded the document. It was written on legal paper,
LINE 76: in her father's own hand.
LINE 77: Mrs. Carteret was not familiar with legal verbiage, and there were
LINE 78: several expressions of which she did not perhaps appreciate the full
LINE 79: effect; but a very hasty glance enabled her to ascertain the purport of
LINE 80: the paper. It was a will, by which, in one item, her father devised to
LINE 81: his daughter Janet, the child of the woman known as Julia Brown, the sum
LINE 82: of ten thousand dollars, and a certain plantation or tract of land a
LINE 83: short distance from the town of Wellington. The rest and residue of his
LINE 84: estate, after deducting all legal charges and expenses, was bequeathed
LINE 85: to his beloved daughter, Olivia Merkell.
LINE 86: Mrs. Carteret breathed a sigh of relief. Her father had not preferred
LINE 87: another to her, but had left to his lawful daughter the bulk of his
LINE 88: estate. She felt at the same time a growing indignation at the thought
LINE 89: that that woman should so have wrought upon her father's weakness as to
LINE 90: induce him to think of leaving so much valuable property to her
LINE 91: bastard,--property which by right should go, and now would go, to her
LINE 92: own son, to whom by every rule of law and decency it ought to descend.
LINE 93: A fire was burning in the next room, on account of the baby,--there had
LINE 94: been a light frost the night before, and the air was somewhat chilly.
LINE 95: For the moment the room was empty. Mrs. Carteret came out from her
LINE 96: chamber and threw the offending paper into the fire, and watched it
LINE 97: slowly burn. When it had been consumed, the carbon residue of one sheet
LINE 98: still retained its form, and she could read the words on the charred
LINE 99: portion. A sentence, which had escaped her eye in her rapid reading,
LINE 100: stood out in ghostly black upon the gray background:--
LINE 101: "All the rest and residue of my estate I devise and bequeath to my
LINE 102: daughter Olivia Merkell, the child of my beloved first wife."
LINE 103: Mrs. Carteret had not before observed the word "first." Instinctively
LINE 104: she stretched toward the fire the poker which she held in her hand, and
LINE 105: at its touch the shadowy remnant fell to pieces, and nothing but ashes
LINE 106: remained upon the hearth.
LINE 107: Not until the next morning did she think again of the envelope which had
LINE 108: contained the paper she had burned. Opening the drawer where it lay, the
LINE 109: oblong blue envelope confronted her. The sight of it was distasteful.
LINE 110: The indorsed side lay uppermost, and the words seemed like a mute
LINE 111: reproach:--
LINE 112: "The Last Will and Testament of Samuel Merkell."
LINE 113: Snatching up the envelope, she glanced into it mechanically as she moved
LINE 114: toward the next room, and perceived a thin folded paper which had
LINE 115: heretofore escaped her notice. When opened, it proved to be a
LINE 116: certificate of marriage, in due form, between Samuel Merkell and Julia
LINE 117: Brown. It was dated from a county in South Carolina, about two years
LINE 118: before her father's death.
LINE 119: For a moment Mrs. Carteret stood gazing blankly at this faded slip of
LINE 120: paper. Her father _had_ married this woman!--at least he had gone
LINE 121: through the form of marriage with her, for to him it had surely been no
LINE 122: more than an empty formality. The marriage of white and colored persons
LINE 123: was forbidden by law. Only recently she had read of a case where both
LINE 124: the parties to such a crime, a colored man and a white woman, had been
LINE 125: sentenced to long terms in the penitentiary. She even recalled the
LINE 126: circumstances. The couple had been living together unlawfully,--they
LINE 127: were very low people, whose private lives were beneath the public
LINE 128: notice,--but influenced by a religious movement pervading the community,
LINE 129: had sought, they said at the trial, to secure the blessing of God upon
LINE 130: their union. The higher law, which imperiously demanded that the purity
LINE 131: and prestige of the white race be preserved at any cost, had intervened
LINE 132: at this point.
LINE 133: Mechanically she moved toward the fireplace, so dazed by this discovery
LINE 134: as to be scarcely conscious of her own actions. She surely had not
LINE 135: formed any definite intention of destroying this piece of paper when her
LINE 136: fingers relaxed unconsciously and let go their hold upon it. The draught
LINE 137: swept it toward the fireplace. Ere scarcely touching the flames it
LINE 138: caught, blazed fiercely, and shot upward with the current of air. A
LINE 139: moment later the record of poor Julia's marriage was scattered to the
LINE 140: four winds of heaven, as her poor body had long since mingled with the
LINE 141: dust of earth.
LINE 142: The letter remained unread. In her agitation at the discovery of the
LINE 143: marriage certificate, Olivia had almost forgotten the existence of the
LINE 144: letter. It was addressed to "John Delamere, Esq., as Executor of my Last
LINE 145: Will and Testament," while the lower left hand corner bore the
LINE 146: direction: "To be delivered only after my death, with seal unbroken."
LINE 147: The seal was broken already; Mr. Delamere was dead; the letter could
LINE 148: never be delivered. Mrs. Carteret unfolded it and read:--
LINE 149: MY DEAR DELAMERE,--I have taken the liberty of naming you as executor of
LINE 150: my last will, because you are my friend, and the only man of my
LINE 151: acquaintance whom I feel that I can trust to carry out my wishes,
LINE 152: appreciate my motives, and preserve the silence I desire.
LINE 153: I have, first, a confession to make. Inclosed in this letter you will
LINE 154: find a certificate of marriage between my child Janet's mother and
LINE 155: myself. While I have never exactly repented of this marriage, I have
LINE 156: never had the courage to acknowledge it openly. If I had not married
LINE 157: Julia, I fear Polly Ochiltree would have married me by main force,--as
LINE 158: she would marry you or any other gentleman unfortunate enough to fall in
LINE 159: the way of this twice-widowed man-hunter. When my wife died, three years
LINE 160: ago, her sister Polly offered to keep house for me and the child. I
LINE 161: would sooner have had the devil in the house, and yet I trembled with
LINE 162: alarm,--there seemed no way of escape,--it was so clearly and obviously
LINE 163: the proper thing.
LINE 164: But she herself gave me my opportunity. I was on the point of
LINE 165: consenting, when she demanded, as a condition of her coming, that I
LINE 166: discharge Julia, my late wife's maid. She was laboring under a
LINE 167: misapprehension in regard to the girl, but I grasped at the straw, and
LINE 168: did everything to foster her delusion. I declared solemnly that nothing
LINE 169: under heaven would induce me to part with Julia. The controversy
LINE 170: resulted in my permitting Polly to take the child, while I retained the
LINE 171: maid.
LINE 172: Before Polly put this idea into my head, I had scarcely looked at Julia,
LINE 173: but this outbreak turned my attention toward her. She was a handsome
LINE 174: girl, and, as I soon found out, a good girl. My wife, who raised her,
LINE 175: was a Christian woman, and had taught her modesty and virtue. She was
LINE 176: free. The air was full of liberty, and equal rights, and all the
LINE 177: abolition claptrap, and she made marriage a condition of her remaining
LINE 178: longer in the house. In a moment of weakness I took her away to a place
LINE 179: where we were not known, and married her. If she had left me, I should
LINE 180: have fallen a victim to Polly Ochiltree,--to which any fate was
LINE 181: preferable.
LINE 182: And then, old friend, my weakness kept to the fore. I was ashamed of
LINE 183: this marriage, and my new wife saw it. Moreover, she loved me,--too
LINE 184: well, indeed, to wish to make me unhappy. The ceremony had satisfied her
LINE 185: conscience, had set her right, she said, with God; for the opinions of
LINE 186: men she did not care, since I loved her,--she only wanted to compensate
LINE 187: me, as best she could, for the great honor I had done my
LINE 188: handmaiden,--for she had read her Bible, and I was the Abraham to her
LINE 189: Hagar, compared with whom she considered herself at a great advantage.
LINE 190: It was her own proposition that nothing be said of this marriage. If any
LINE 191: shame should fall on her, it would fall lightly, for it would be
LINE 192: undeserved. When the child came, she still kept silence. No one, she
LINE 193: argued, could blame an innocent child for the accident of birth, and in
LINE 194: the sight of God this child had every right to exist; while among her
LINE 195: own people illegitimacy would involve but little stigma. I need not
LINE 196: say that I was easily persuaded to accept this sacrifice; but touched by
LINE 197: her fidelity, I swore to provide handsomely for them both. This I have
LINE 198: tried to do by the will of which I ask you to act as executor. Had I
LINE 199: left the child more, it might serve as a ground for attacking the will;
LINE 200: my acknowledgment of the tie of blood is sufficient to justify a
LINE 201: reasonable bequest.
LINE 202: I have taken this course for the sake of my daughter Olivia, who is dear
LINE 203: to me, and whom I would not wish to make ashamed; and in deference to
LINE 204: public opinion, which it is not easy to defy. If, after my death, Julia
LINE 205: should choose to make our secret known, I shall of course be beyond the
LINE 206: reach of hard words; but loyalty to my memory will probably keep her
LINE 207: silent. A strong man would long since have acknowledged her before the
LINE 208: world and taken the consequences; but, alas! I am only myself, and the
LINE 209: atmosphere I live in does not encourage moral heroism. I should like to
LINE 210: be different, but it is God who hath made us, and not we ourselves!
LINE 211: Nevertheless, old friend, I will ask of you one favor. If in the future
LINE 212: this child of Julia's and of mine should grow to womanhood; if she
LINE 213: should prove to have her mother's gentleness and love of virtue; if, in
LINE 214: the new era which is opening up for her mother's race, to which,
LINE 215: unfortunately, she must belong, she should become, in time, an educated
LINE 216: woman; and if the time should ever come when, by virtue of her education
LINE 217: or the development of her people, it would be to her a source of shame
LINE 218: or unhappiness that she was an illegitimate child,--if you are still
LINE 219: alive, old friend, and have the means of knowing or divining this thing,
LINE 220: go to her and tell her, for me, that she is my lawful child, and ask
LINE 221: her to forgive her father's weakness.
LINE 222: When this letter comes to you, I shall have passed to--the Beyond; but I
LINE 223: am confident that you will accept this trust, for which I thank you now,
LINE 224: in advance, most heartily.
LINE 225: The letter was signed with her father's name, the same signature which
LINE 226: had been attached to the will.
LINE 227: Having firmly convinced herself of the illegality of the papers, and of
LINE 228: her own right to destroy them, Mrs. Carteret ought to have felt relieved
LINE 229: that she had thus removed all traces of her dead father's folly. True,
LINE 230: the other daughter remained,--she had seen her on the street only the
LINE 231: day before. The sight of this person she had always found offensive, and
LINE 232: now, she felt, in view of what she had just learned, it must be even
LINE 233: more so. Never, while this woman lived in the town, would she be able to
LINE 234: throw the veil of forgetfulness over this blot upon her father's memory.
LINE 235: As the day wore on, Mrs. Carteret grew still less at ease. To herself,
LINE 236: marriage was a serious thing,--to a right-thinking woman the most
LINE 237: serious concern of life. A marriage certificate, rightfully procured,
LINE 238: was scarcely less solemn, so far as it went, than the Bible itself. Her
LINE 239: own she cherished as the apple of her eye. It was the evidence of her
LINE 240: wifehood, the seal of her child's legitimacy, her patent of
LINE 241: nobility,--the token of her own and her child's claim to social place
LINE 242: and consideration. She had burned this pretended marriage certificate
LINE 243: because it meant nothing. Nevertheless, she could not ignore the
LINE 244: knowledge of another such marriage, of which every one in the town
LINE 245: knew,--a celebrated case, indeed, where a white man, of a family quite
LINE 246: as prominent as her father's, had married a colored woman during the
LINE 247: military occupation of the state just after the civil war. The legality
LINE 248: of the marriage had never been questioned. It had been fully consummated
LINE 249: by twenty years of subsequent cohabitation. No amount of social
LINE 250: persecution had ever shaken the position of the husband. With an iron
LINE 251: will he had stayed on in the town, a living protest against the
LINE 252: established customs of the South, so rudely interrupted for a few short
LINE 253: years; and, though his children were negroes, though he had never
LINE 254: appeared in public with his wife, no one had ever questioned the
LINE 255: validity of his marriage or the legitimacy of his offspring.
LINE 256: The marriage certificate which Mrs. Carteret had burned dated from the
LINE 257: period of the military occupation. Hence Mrs. Carteret, who was a good
LINE 258: woman, and would not have done a dishonest thing, felt decidedly
LINE 259: uncomfortable. She had destroyed the marriage certificate, but its ghost
LINE 260: still haunted her.
LINE 261: Major Carteret, having just eaten a good dinner, was in a very agreeable
LINE 262: humor when, that same evening, his wife brought up again the subject of
LINE 263: their previous discussion.
LINE 264: "Phil," she asked, "Aunt Polly told me that once, long before my father
LINE 265: died, when she went to remonstrate with him for keeping that Woman in
LINE 266: the house, he threatened to marry Julia if Aunt Polly ever said another
LINE 267: word to him about the matter. Suppose he _had_ married her, and had then
LINE 268: left a will,--would the marriage have made any difference, so far as the
LINE 269: will was concerned?"
LINE 270: Major Carteret laughed. "Your Aunt Polly," he said, "was a remarkable
LINE 271: woman, with a wonderful imagination, which seems to have grown more
LINE 272: vivid as her memory and judgment weakened. Why should your father marry
LINE 273: his negro housemaid? Mr. Merkell was never rated as a fool,--he had one
LINE 274: of the clearest heads in Wellington. I saw him only a day or two before
LINE 275: he died, and I could swear before any court in Christendom that he was
LINE 276: of sound mind and memory to the last. These notions of your aunt were
LINE 277: mere delusions. Your father was never capable of such a folly."
LINE 278: "Of course I am only supposing a case," returned Olivia. "Imagining such
LINE 279: a case, just for the argument, would the marriage have been legal?"
LINE 280: "That would depend. If he had married her during the military
LINE 281: occupation, or over in South Carolina, the marriage would have been
LINE 282: legally valid, though morally and socially outrageous."
LINE 283: "And if he had died afterwards, leaving a will?"
LINE 284: "The will would have controlled the disposition of his estate, in all
LINE 285: probability."
LINE 286: "Suppose he had left no will?"
LINE 287: "You are getting the matter down pretty fine, my dear! The woman would
LINE 288: have taken one third of the real estate for life, and could have lived
LINE 289: in the homestead until she died. She would also have had half the other
LINE 290: property,--the money and goods and furniture, everything except the
LINE 291: land,--and the negro child would have shared with you the balance of the
LINE 292: estate. That, I believe, is according to the law of descent and
LINE 293: distribution."
LINE 294: Mrs. Carteret lapsed into a troubled silence. Her father _had_ married
LINE 295: the woman. In her heart she had no doubt of the validity of the
LINE 296: marriage, so far as the law was concerned; if one marriage of such a
LINE 297: kind would stand, another contracted under similar conditions was
LINE 298: equally as good. If the marriage had been valid, Julia's child had been
LINE 299: legitimate. The will she had burned gave this sister of hers--she
LINE 300: shuddered at the word--but a small part of the estate. Under the law,
LINE 301: which intervened now that there was no will, the property should have
LINE 302: been equally divided. If the woman had been white,--but the woman had
LINE 303: _not_ been white, and the same rule of moral conduct did not, _could_
LINE 304: not, in the very nature of things, apply, as between white people! For,
LINE 305: if this were not so, slavery had been, not merely an economic mistake,
LINE 306: but a great crime against humanity. If it had been such a crime, as for
LINE 307: a moment she dimly perceived it might have been, then through the long
LINE 308: centuries there had been piled up a catalogue of wrong and outrage
LINE 309: which, if the law of compensation be a law of nature, must some time,
LINE 310: somewhere, in some way, be atoned for. She herself had not escaped the
LINE 311: penalty, of which, she realized, this burden placed upon her conscience
LINE 312: was but another installment.
LINE 313: If she should make known the facts she had learned, it would mean
LINE 314: what?--a division of her father's estate, a recognition of the legality
LINE 315: of her father's relations with Julia. Such a stain upon her father's
LINE 316: memory would be infinitely worse than if he had _not_ married her. To
LINE 317: have lived with her without marriage was a social misdemeanor, at which
LINE 318: society in the old days had winked, or at most had frowned. To have
LINE 319: married her was to have committed the unpardonable social sin. Such a
LINE 320: scandal Mrs. Carteret could not have endured. Should she seek to make
LINE 321: restitution, it would necessarily involve the disclosure of at least
LINE 322: some of the facts. Had she not destroyed the will, she might have
LINE 323: compromised with her conscience by producing it and acting upon its
LINE 324: terms, which had been so stated as not to disclose the marriage. This
LINE 325: was now rendered impossible by her own impulsive act; she could not
LINE 326: mention the will at all, without admitting that she had destroyed it.
LINE 327: Mrs. Carteret found herself in what might be called, vulgarly, a moral
LINE 328: "pocket." She could, of course, remain silent. Mrs. Carteret was a good
LINE 329: woman, according to her lights, with a cultivated conscience, to which
LINE 330: she had always looked as her mentor and infallible guide.
LINE 331: Hence Mrs. Carteret, after this painful discovery, remained for a long
LINE 332: time ill at ease,--so disturbed, indeed, that her mind reacted upon her
LINE 333: nerves, which had never been strong; and her nervousness affected her
LINE 334: strength, which had never been great, until Carteret, whose love for her
LINE 335: had been deepened and strengthened by the advent of his son, became
LINE 336: alarmed for her health, and spoke very seriously to Dr. Price concerning
LINE 337: it.
