LINE 1: Carteret fished from the depths of the waste-basket and handed to the
LINE 2: general an eighteen by twenty-four sheet, poorly printed on cheap paper,
LINE 3: with a "patent" inside, a number of advertisements of proprietary
LINE 4: medicines, quack doctors, and fortune-tellers, and two or three columns
LINE 5: of editorial and local news. Candor compels the admission that it was
LINE 6: not an impressive sheet in any respect, except when regarded as the
LINE 7: first local effort of a struggling people to make public expression of
LINE 8: their life and aspirations. From this point of view it did not speak at
LINE 9: all badly for a class to whom, a generation before, newspapers, books,
LINE 10: and learning had been forbidden fruit.
LINE 11: "It's an elegant specimen of journalism, isn't it?" laughed the general,
LINE 12: airily. "Listen to this 'ad':--
LINE 13: "'Kinky, curly hair made straight by one application of our specific.
LINE 14: Our face bleach will turn the skin of a black or brown person four or
LINE 15: five shades lighter, and of a mulatto perfectly white. When you get the
LINE 16: color you wish, stop using the preparation.'
LINE 17: "Just look at those heads!--'Before using' and 'After using.' We'd
LINE 18: better hurry, or there'll be no negroes to disfranchise! If they don't
LINE 19: stop till they get the color they desire, and the stuff works according
LINE 20: to contract, they'll all be white. Ah! what have we here? This looks as
LINE 21: though it might be serious." Opening the sheet the general read aloud
LINE 22: an editorial article, to which Carteret listened intently, his
LINE 23: indignation increasing in strength from the first word to the last,
LINE 24: while McBane's face grew darkly purple with anger.
LINE 25: The article was a frank and somewhat bold discussion of lynching and its
LINE 26: causes. It denied that most lynchings were for the offense most
LINE 27: generally charged as their justification, and declared that, even of
LINE 28: those seemingly traced to this cause, many were not for crimes at all,
LINE 29: but for voluntary acts which might naturally be expected to follow from
LINE 30: the miscegenation laws by which it was sought, in all the Southern
LINE 31: States, to destroy liberty of contract, and, for the purpose of
LINE 32: maintaining a fanciful purity of race, to make crimes of marriages to
LINE 33: which neither nature nor religion nor the laws of other states
LINE 34: interposed any insurmountable barrier. Such an article in a Northern
LINE 35: newspaper would have attracted no special attention, and might merely
LINE 36: have furnished food to an occasional reader for serious thought upon a
LINE 37: subject not exactly agreeable; but coming from a colored man, in a
LINE 38: Southern city, it was an indictment of the laws and social system of the
LINE 39: South that could not fail of creating a profound sensation.
LINE 40: "Infamous--infamous!" exclaimed Carteret, his voice trembling with
LINE 41: emotion. "The paper should be suppressed immediately."
LINE 42: "The impudent nigger ought to be horsewhipped and run out of town,"
LINE 43: growled McBane.
LINE 44: "Gentlemen," said the general soothingly, after the first burst of
LINE 45: indignation had subsided, "I believe we can find a more effective use
LINE 46: for this article, which, by the way, will not bear too close
LINE 47: analysis,--there's some truth in it, at least there's an argument."
LINE 48: "That is not the point," interrupted Carteret.
LINE 49: "No," interjected McBane with an oath, "that ain't at all the point.
LINE 50: Truth or not, no damn nigger has any right to say it."
LINE 51: "This article," said Carteret, "violates an unwritten law of the South.
LINE 52: If we are to tolerate this race of weaklings among us, until they are
LINE 53: eliminated by the stress of competition, it must be upon terms which we
LINE 54: lay down. One of our conditions is violated by this article, in which
LINE 55: our wisdom is assailed, and our women made the subject of offensive
LINE 56: comment. We must make known our disapproval."
LINE 57: "I say lynch the nigger, break up the press, and burn down the newspaper
LINE 58: office," McBane responded promptly.
LINE 59: "Gentlemen," interposed the general, "would you mind suspending the
LINE 60: discussion for a moment, while I mind Jerry across the street? I think I
LINE 61: can then suggest a better plan."
LINE 62: Carteret rang the bell for Jerry, who answered promptly. He had been
LINE 63: expecting such a call ever since the gentlemen had gone in.
LINE 64: "Jerry," said the general, "step across to Brown's and tell him to send
LINE 65: me three Calhoun cocktails. Wait for them,--here's the money."
LINE 66: "Yas, suh," replied Jerry, taking the proffered coin.
LINE 67: "And make has'e, charcoal," added McBane, "for we're gettin' damn dry."
LINE 68: A momentary cloud of annoyance darkened Carteret's brow. McBane had
LINE 69: always grated upon his aristocratic susceptibilities. The captain was an
LINE 70: upstart, a product of the democratic idea operating upon the poor white
LINE 71: man, the descendant of the indentured bondservant and the socially
LINE 72: unfit. He had wealth and energy, however, and it was necessary to make
LINE 73: use of him; but the example of such men was a strong incentive to
LINE 74: Carteret in his campaign against the negro. It was distasteful enough to
LINE 75: rub elbows with an illiterate and vulgar white man of no ancestry,--the
LINE 76: risk of similar contact with negroes was to be avoided at any cost. He
LINE 77: could hardly expect McBane to be a gentleman, but when among men of that
LINE 78: class he might at least try to imitate their manners. A gentleman did
LINE 79: not order his own servants around offensively, to say nothing of
LINE 80: another's.
LINE 81: The general had observed Carteret's annoyance, and remarked pleasantly
LINE 82: while they waited for the servant's return:--
LINE 83: "Jerry, now, is a very good negro. He's not one of your new negroes,
LINE 84: who think themselves as good as white men, and want to run the
LINE 85: government. Jerry knows his place,--he is respectful, humble, obedient,
LINE 86: and content with the face and place assigned to him by nature."
LINE 87: "Yes, he's one of the best of 'em," sneered McBane. "He'll call any man
LINE 88: 'master' for a quarter, or 'God' for half a dollar; for a dollar he'll
LINE 89: grovel at your feet, and for a cast-off coat you can buy an option on
LINE 90: his immortal soul,--if he has one! I've handled niggers for ten years,
LINE 91: and I know 'em from the ground up. They're all alike,--they're a scrub
LINE 92: race, an affliction to the country, and the quicker we're rid of 'em
LINE 93: all the better."
LINE 94: Carteret had nothing to say by way of dissent. McBane's sentiments, in
LINE 95: their last analysis, were much the same as his, though he would have
LINE 96: expressed them less brutally. "The negro," observed the general,
LINE 97: daintily flicking the ash from his cigar, "is all right in his place and
LINE 98: very useful to the community. We lived on his labor for quite a long
LINE 99: time, and lived very well. Nevertheless we are better off without
LINE 100: slavery, for we can get more out of the free negro, and with less
LINE 101: responsibility. I really do not see how we could get along without the
LINE 102: negroes. If they were all like Jerry, we'd have no trouble with them."
LINE 103: Having procured the drinks, Jerry, the momentary subject of the race
LINE 104: discussion which goes on eternally in the South, was making his way back
LINE 105: across the street, somewhat disturbed in mind.
LINE 106: "O Lawd!" he groaned, "I never troubles trouble till trouble troubles
LINE 107: me; but w'en I got dem drinks befo', Gin'l Belmont gimme half a dollar
LINE 108: an' tol' me ter keep de change. Dis time he didn' say nothin' 'bout de
LINE 109: change. I s'pose he jes' fergot erbout it, but w'at is a po' nigger
LINE 110: gwine ter do w'en he has ter conten' wid w'ite folks's fergitfulniss? I
LINE 111: don' see no way but ter do some fergittin' myse'f. I'll jes' stan'
LINE 112: outside de do' here till dey gits so wrop' up in deir talk dat dey won'
LINE 113: 'member nothin' e'se, an' den at de right minute I'll ban' de glasses
LINE 114: 'roun, an' moa' lackly de gin'l 'll fergit all 'bout de change."
LINE 115: While Jerry stood outside, the conversation within was plainly audible,
LINE 116: and some inkling of its purport filtered through his mind.
LINE 117: "Now, gentlemen," the general was saying, "here's my plan. That
LINE 118: editorial in the negro newspaper is good campaign matter, but we should
LINE 119: reserve it until it will be most effective. Suppose we just stick it in
LINE 120: a pigeon-hole, and let the editor,--what's his name?"
LINE 121: "The nigger's name is Barber," replied McBane. "I'd like to have him
LINE 122: under me for a month or two; he'd write no more editorials."
LINE 123: "Let Barber have all the rope he wants," resumed the general, "and
LINE 124: he'll be sure to hang himself. In the mean time we will continue to work
LINE 125: up public opinion,--we can use this letter privately for that
LINE 126: purpose,--and when the state campaign opens we'll print the editorial,
LINE 127: with suitable comment, scatter it broadcast throughout the state, fire
LINE 128: the Southern heart, organize the white people on the color line, have a
LINE 129: little demonstration with red shirts and shotguns, scare the negroes
LINE 130: into fits, win the state for white supremacy, and teach our colored
LINE 131: fellow citizens that we are tired of negro domination and have put an
LINE 132: end to it forever. The Afro-American Banner will doubtless die about the
LINE 133: same time."
LINE 134: "And so will the editor!" exclaimed McBane ferociously; "I'll see to
LINE 135: that. But I wonder where that nigger is with them cocktails? I'm so
LINE 136: thirsty I could swallow blue blazes."
LINE 137: "Here's yo' drinks, gin'l," announced Jerry, entering with the glasses
LINE 138: on a tray.
LINE 139: The gentlemen exchanged compliments and imbibed--McBane at a gulp,
LINE 140: Carteret with more deliberation, leaving about half the contents of his
LINE 141: glass.
LINE 142: The general drank slowly, with every sign of appreciation. "If the
LINE 143: illustrious statesman," he observed, "whose name this mixture bears, had
LINE 144: done nothing more than invent it, his fame would still deserve to go
LINE 145: thundering down the endless ages."
LINE 146: "It ain't bad liquor," assented McBane, smacking his lips.
LINE 147: Jerry received the empty glasses on the tray and left the room. He had
LINE 148: scarcely gained the hall when the general called him back.
LINE 149: "O Lawd!" groaned Jerry, "he's gwine ter ax me fer de change. Yas, suh,
LINE 150: yas, suh; comin', gin'l, comin', suh!"
LINE 151: "You may keep the change, Jerry," said the general.
LINE 152: Jerry's face grew radiant at this announcement. "Yas, suh, gin'l; thank
LINE 153: y', suh; much obleedzed, suh. I wuz jus' gwine ter fetch it in, suh,
LINE 154: w'en I had put de tray down. Thank y', suh, truly, suh!"
LINE 155: Jerry backed and bowed himself out into the hall.
LINE 156: "Dat wuz a close shave," he muttered, as he swallowed the remaining
LINE 157: contents of Major Carteret's glass. "I 'lowed dem twenty cents wuz gone
LINE 158: dat time,--an' whar I wuz gwine ter git de money ter take my gal ter de
LINE 159: chu'ch festibal ter-night, de Lawd only knows!--'less'n I borried it
LINE 160: offn Mr. Ellis, an' I owes him sixty cents a'ready. But I wonduh w'at
LINE 161: dem w'ite folks in dere is up ter? Dere's one thing sho',--dey're
LINE 162: gwine ter git after de niggers some way er 'nuther, an' w'en dey does,
LINE 163: whar is Jerry gwine ter be? Dat's de mos' impo'tantes' question. I'm
LINE 164: gwine ter look at dat newspaper dey be'n talkin' 'bout, an' 'less'n my
LINE 165: min' changes might'ly, I'm gwine ter keep my mouf shet an' stan' in wid
LINE 166: de Angry-Saxon race,--ez dey calls deyse'ves nowadays,--an' keep on de
LINE 167: right side er my bread an' meat. Wat nigger ever give me twenty cents in
LINE 168: all my bawn days?"
LINE 169: "By the way, major," said the general, who lingered behind McBane as
LINE 170: they were leaving, "is Miss Clara's marriage definitely settled upon?"
LINE 171: "Well, general, not exactly; but it's the understanding that they will
LINE 172: marry when they are old enough."
LINE 173: "I was merely thinking," the general went on, "that if I were you I'd
LINE 174: speak to Tom about cards and liquor. He gives more time to both than a
LINE 175: young man can afford. I'm speaking in his interest and in Miss
LINE 176: Clara's,--we of the old families ought to stand together."
LINE 177: "Thank you, general, for the hint. I'll act upon it."
LINE 178: This political conference was fruitful in results. Acting upon the plans
LINE 179: there laid out, McBane traveled extensively through the state, working
LINE 180: up sentiment in favor of the new movement. He possessed a certain
LINE 181: forceful eloquence; and white supremacy was so obviously the divine
LINE 182: intention that he had merely to affirm the doctrine in order to secure
LINE 183: adherents.
LINE 184: General Belmont, whose business required him to spend much of the winter
LINE 185: in Washington and New York, lost no opportunity to get the ear of
LINE 186: lawmakers, editors, and other leaders of national opinion, and to
LINE 187: impress upon them, with persuasive eloquence, the impossibility of
LINE 188: maintaining existing conditions, and the tremendous blunder which had
LINE 189: been made in conferring the franchise upon the emancipated race.
LINE 190: Carteret conducted the press campaign, and held out to the Republicans
LINE 191: of the North the glittering hope that, with the elimination of the negro
LINE 192: vote, and a proper deference to Southern feeling, a strong white
LINE 193: Republican party might be built up in the New South. How well the bait
LINE 194: took is a matter of history,--but the promised result is still in the
LINE 195: future. The disfranchisement of the negro has merely changed the form of
LINE 196: the same old problem. The negro had no vote before the rebellion, and
LINE 197: few other rights, and yet the negro question was, for a century, the
LINE 198: pivot of American politics. It plunged the nation into a bloody war,
LINE 199: and it will trouble the American government and the American conscience
LINE 200: until a sustained attempt is made to settle it upon principles of
LINE 201: justice and equity.
LINE 202: The personal ambitions entertained by the leaders of this movement are
LINE 203: but slightly involved in this story. McBane's aims have been touched
LINE 204: upon elsewhere. The general would have accepted the nomination for
LINE 205: governor of the state, with a vision of a senatorship in the future.
LINE 206: Carteret hoped to vindicate the supremacy of his race, and make the
LINE 207: state fit for his son to live in, and, incidentally, he would not refuse
LINE 208: any office, worthy of his dignity, which a grateful people might thrust
LINE 209: upon him.
LINE 210: So powerful a combination of bigot, self-seeking demagogue, and astute
LINE 211: politician was fraught with grave menace to the peace of the state and
LINE 212: the liberties of the people,--by which is meant the whole people, and
LINE 213: not any one class, sought to be built up at the expense of another.
