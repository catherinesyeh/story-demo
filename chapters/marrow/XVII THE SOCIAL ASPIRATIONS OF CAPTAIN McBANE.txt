LINE 1: It was only eleven o'clock, and Delamere, not being at all sleepy, and
LINE 2: feeling somewhat out of sorts as the combined results of his afternoon's
LINE 3: debauch and the snubbing he had received at Clara's hands, directed the
LINE 4: major's coachman, who had taken charge of the trap upon its arrival, to
LINE 5: drive him to the St. James Hotel before returning the horses to the
LINE 6: stable. First, however, the coachman left Ellis at his boarding-house,
LINE 7: which was near by. The two young men parted with as scant courtesy as
LINE 8: was possible without an open rupture.
LINE 9: Delamere hoped to find at the hotel some form of distraction to fill in
LINE 10: an hour or two before going home. Ill fortune favored him by placing in
LINE 11: his way the burly form of Captain George McBane, who was sitting in an
LINE 12: armchair alone, smoking a midnight cigar, under the hotel balcony. Upon
LINE 13: Delamere's making known his desire for amusement, the captain proposed a
LINE 14: small game of poker in his own room.
LINE 15: McBane had been waiting for some such convenient opportunity. We have
LINE 16: already seen that the captain was desirous of social recognition, which
LINE 17: he had not yet obtained beyond the superficial acquaintance acquired by
LINE 18: association with men about town. He had determined to assault society in
LINE 19: its citadel by seeking membership in the Clarendon Club, of which most
LINE 20: gentlemen of the best families of the city were members.
LINE 21: The Clarendon Club was a historic institution, and its membership a
LINE 22: social cult, the temple of which was located just off the main street of
LINE 23: the city, in a dignified old colonial mansion which had housed it for
LINE 24: the nearly one hundred years during which it had maintained its
LINE 25: existence unbroken. There had grown up around it many traditions and
LINE 26: special usages. Membership in the Clarendon was the _sine qua non_ of
LINE 27: high social standing, and was conditional upon two of three
LINE 28: things,--birth, wealth, and breeding. Breeding was the prime essential,
LINE 29: but, with rare exceptions, must be backed by either birth or money.
LINE 30: Having decided, therefore, to seek admission into this social arcanum,
LINE 31: the captain, who had either not quite appreciated the standard of the
LINE 32: Clarendon's membership, or had failed to see that he fell beneath it,
LINE 33: looked about for an intermediary through whom to approach the object of
LINE 34: his desire. He had already thought of Tom Delamere in this connection,
LINE 35: having with him such an acquaintance as one forms around a hotel, and
LINE 36: having long ago discovered that Delamere was a young man of
LINE 37: superficially amiable disposition, vicious instincts, lax principles,
LINE 38: and a weak will, and, which was quite as much to the purpose, a member
LINE 39: of the Clarendon Club. Possessing mental characteristics almost entirely
LINE 40: opposite, Delamere and the captain had certain tastes in common, and had
LINE 41: smoked, drunk, and played cards together more than once.
LINE 42: Still more to his purpose, McBane had detected Delamere trying to cheat
LINE 43: him at cards. He had said nothing about this discovery, but had merely
LINE 44: noted it as something which at some future time might prove useful. The
LINE 45: captain had not suffered by Delamere's deviation from the straight line
LINE 46: of honor, for while Tom was as clever with the cards as might be
LINE 47: expected of a young man who had devoted most of his leisure for several
LINE 48: years to handling them, McBane was past master in their manipulation.
LINE 49: During a stormy career he had touched more or less pitch, and had
LINE 50: escaped few sorts of defilement.
LINE 51: The appearance of Delamere at a late hour, unaccompanied, and wearing
LINE 52: upon his countenance an expression in which the captain read aright the
LINE 53: craving for mental and physical excitement, gave him the opportunity for
LINE 54: which he had been looking. McBane was not the man to lose an
LINE 55: opportunity, nor did Delamere require a second invitation. Neither was
LINE 56: it necessary, during the progress of the game, for the captain to press
LINE 57: upon his guest the contents of the decanter which stood upon the table
LINE 58: within convenient reach.
LINE 59: The captain permitted Delamere to win from him several small amounts,
LINE 60: after which he gradually increased the stakes and turned the tables.
LINE 61: Delamere, with every instinct of a gamester, was no more a match for
LINE 62: McBane in self-control than in skill. When the young man had lost all
LINE 63: his money, the captain expressed his entire willingness to accept notes
LINE 64: of hand, for which he happened to have convenient blanks in his
LINE 65: apartment.
LINE 66: When Delamere, flushed with excitement and wine, rose from the gaming
LINE 67: table at two o'clock, he was vaguely conscious that he owed McBane a
LINE 68: considerable sum, but could not have stated how much. His opponent, who
LINE 69: was entirely cool and collected, ran his eye carelessly over the bits of
LINE 70: paper to which Delamere had attached his signature. "Just one thousand
LINE 71: dollars even," he remarked.
LINE 72: The announcement of this total had as sobering an effect upon Delamere
LINE 73: as though he had been suddenly deluged with a shower of cold water. For
LINE 74: a moment he caught his breath. He had not a dollar in the world with
LINE 75: which to pay this sum. His only source of income was an allowance from
LINE 76: his grandfather, the monthly installment of which, drawn that very day,
LINE 77: he had just lost to McBane, before starting in upon the notes of hand.
LINE 78: "I'll give you your revenge another time," said McBane, as they rose.
LINE 79: "Luck is against you to-night, and I'm unwilling to take advantage of a
LINE 80: clever young fellow like you. Meantime," he added, tossing the notes of
LINE 81: hand carelessly on a bureau, "don't worry about these bits of paper.
LINE 82: Such small matters shouldn't cut any figure between friends; but if you
LINE 83: are around the hotel to-morrow, I should like to speak to you upon
LINE 84: another subject."
LINE 85: "Very well, captain," returned Tom somewhat ungraciously.
LINE 86: Delamere had been completely beaten with his own weapons. He had tried
LINE 87: desperately to cheat McBane. He knew perfectly well that McBane had
LINE 88: discovered his efforts and had cheated him in turn, for the captain's
LINE 89: play had clearly been gauged to meet his own. The biter had been bit,
LINE 90: and could not complain of the outcome.
LINE 91: The following afternoon McBane met Delamere at the hotel, and bluntly
LINE 92: requested the latter to propose him for membership in the Clarendon
LINE 93: Club.
LINE 94: Delamere was annoyed at this request. His aristocratic gorge rose at the
LINE 95: presumption of this son of an overseer and ex-driver of convicts.
LINE 96: McBane was good enough to win money from, or even to lose money to, but
LINE 97: not good enough to be recognized as a social equal. He would
LINE 98: instinctively have blackballed McBane had he been proposed by some one
LINE 99: else; with what grace could he put himself forward as the sponsor for
LINE 100: this impossible social aspirant? Moreover, it was clearly a vulgar,
LINE 101: cold-blooded attempt on McBane's part to use his power over him for a
LINE 102: personal advantage.
LINE 103: "Well, now, Captain McBane," returned Delamere diplomatically, "I've
LINE 104: never put any one up yet, and it's not regarded as good form for so
LINE 105: young a member as myself to propose candidates. I'd much rather you'd
LINE 106: ask some older man."
LINE 107: "Oh, well," replied McBane, "just as you say, only I thought you had cut
LINE 108: your eye teeth."
LINE 109: Delamere was not pleased with McBane's tone. His remark was not
LINE 110: acquiescent, though couched in terms of assent. There was a sneering
LINE 111: savagery about it, too, that left Delamere uneasy. He was, in a measure,
LINE 112: in McBane's power. He could not pay the thousand dollars, unless it fell
LINE 113: from heaven, or he could win it from some one else. He would not dare go
LINE 114: to his grandfather for help. Mr. Delamere did not even know that his
LINE 115: grandson gambled. He might not have objected, perhaps, to a gentleman's
LINE 116: game, with moderate stakes, but he would certainly, Tom knew very well,
LINE 117: have looked upon a thousand dollars as a preposterous sum to be lost at
LINE 118: cards by a man who had nothing with which to pay it. It was part of Mr.
LINE 119: Delamere's creed that a gentleman should not make debts that he was not
LINE 120: reasonably able to pay.
LINE 121: There was still another difficulty. If he had lost the money to a
LINE 122: gentleman, and it had been his first serious departure from Mr.
LINE 123: Delamere's perfectly well understood standard of honor, Tom might have
LINE 124: risked a confession and thrown himself on his grandfather's mercy; but
LINE 125: he owed other sums here and there, which, to his just now much disturbed
LINE 126: imagination, loomed up in alarming number and amount. He had recently
LINE 127: observed signs of coldness, too, on the part of certain members of the
LINE 128: club. Moreover, like most men with one commanding vice, he was addicted
LINE 129: to several subsidiary forms of iniquity, which in case of a scandal were
LINE 130: more than likely to come to light. He was clearly and most disagreeably
LINE 131: caught in the net of his own hypocrisy. His grandfather believed him a
LINE 132: model of integrity, a pattern of honor; he could not afford to have his
LINE 133: grandfather undeceived.
LINE 134: He thought of old Mrs. Ochiltree. If she were a liberal soul, she could
LINE 135: give him a thousand dollars now, when he needed it, instead of making
LINE 136: him wait until she died, which might not be for ten years or more, for a
LINE 137: legacy which was steadily growing less and might be entirely exhausted
LINE 138: if she lived long enough,--some old people were very tenacious of life!
LINE 139: She was a careless old woman, too, he reflected, and very foolishly kept
LINE 140: her money in the house. Latterly she had been growing weak and childish.
LINE 141: Some day she might be robbed, and then his prospective inheritance from
LINE 142: that source would vanish into thin air!
LINE 143: With regard to this debt to McBane, if he could not pay it, he could at
LINE 144: least gain a long respite by proposing the captain at the club. True, he
LINE 145: would undoubtedly be blackballed, but before this inevitable event his
LINE 146: name must remain posted for several weeks, during which interval McBane
LINE 147: would be conciliatory. On the other hand, to propose McBane would arouse
LINE 148: suspicion of his own motives; it might reach his grandfather's ears, and
LINE 149: lead to a demand for an explanation, which it would be difficult to
LINE 150: make. Clearly, the better plan would be to temporize with McBane, with
LINE 151: the hope that something might intervene to remove this cursed
LINE 152: obligation.
LINE 153: "Suppose, captain," he said affably, "we leave the matter open for a few
LINE 154: days. This is a thing that can't be rushed. I'll feel the pulse of my
LINE 155: friends and yours, and when we get the lay of the land, the affair can
LINE 156: be accomplished much more easily."
LINE 157: "Well, that's better," returned McBane, somewhat mollified,--"if you'll
LINE 158: do that."
LINE 159: "To be sure I will," replied Tom easily, too much relieved to resent, if
LINE 160: not too preoccupied to perceive, the implied doubt of his veracity.
LINE 161: McBane ordered and paid for more drinks, and they parted on amicable
LINE 162: terms.
LINE 163: "We'll let these notes stand for the time being, Tom," said McBane,
LINE 164: with significant emphasis, when they separated.
LINE 165: Delamere winced at the familiarity. He had reached that degree of moral
LINE 166: deterioration where, while principles were of little moment, the
LINE 167: externals of social intercourse possessed an exaggerated importance.
LINE 168: McBane had never before been so personal.
LINE 169: He had addressed the young aristocrat first as "Mr. Delamere," then, as
LINE 170: their acquaintance advanced, as "Delamere." He had now reached the
LINE 171: abbreviated Christian name stage of familiarity. There was no lower
LINE 172: depth to which Tom could sink, unless McBane should invent a nickname by
LINE 173: which to address him. He did not like McBane's manner,--it was
LINE 174: characterized by a veiled insolence which was exceedingly offensive. He
LINE 175: would go over to the club and try his luck with some honest
LINE 176: player,--perhaps something might turn up to relieve him from his
LINE 177: embarrassment.
LINE 178: He put his hand in his pocket mechanically,--and found it empty! In the
LINE 179: present state of his credit, he could hardly play without money.
LINE 180: A thought struck him. Leaving the hotel, he hastened home, where he
LINE 181: found Sandy dusting his famous suit of clothes on the back piazza. Mr.
LINE 182: Delamere was not at home, having departed for Belleview about two
LINE 183: o'clock, leaving Sandy to follow him in the morning.
LINE 184: "Hello, Sandy," exclaimed Tom, with an assumed jocularity which he was
LINE 185: very far from feeling, "what are you doing with those gorgeous
LINE 186: garments?"
LINE 187: "I'm a-dustin' of 'em, Mistuh Tom, dat's w'at I'm a-doin'. Dere's
LINE 188: somethin' wrong 'bout dese clo's er mine--I don' never seem ter be able
LINE 189: ter keep 'em clean no mo'. Ef I b'lieved in dem ole-timey sayin's, I'd
LINE 190: 'low dere wuz a witch come here eve'y night an' tuk 'em out an' wo' 'em,
LINE 191: er tuk me out an' rid me in 'em. Dere wuz somethin' wrong 'bout dat
LINE 192: cakewalk business, too, dat I ain' never unde'stood an' don' know how
LINE 193: ter 'count fer, 'less dere wuz some kin' er dev'lishness goin' on dat
LINE 194: don' show on de su'face."
LINE 195: "Sandy," asked Tom irrelevantly, "have you any money in the house?"
LINE 196: "Yas, suh, I got de money Mars John give me ter git dem things ter take
LINE 197: out ter Belleview in de mawnin."
LINE 198: "I mean money of your own."
LINE 199: "I got a qua'ter ter buy terbacker wid," returned Sandy cautiously.
LINE 200: "Is that all? Haven't you some saved up?"
LINE 201: "Well, yas, Mistuh Tom," returned Sandy, with evident reluctance, "dere's
LINE 202: a few dollahs put away in my bureau drawer fer a rainy day,--not
LINE 203: much, suh."
LINE 204: "I'm a little short this afternoon, Sandy, and need some money right
LINE 205: away. Grandfather isn't here, so I can't get any from him. Let me take
LINE 206: what you have for a day or two, Sandy, and I'll return it with good
LINE 207: interest."
LINE 208: "Now, Mistuh Tom," said Sandy seriously, "I don' min' lettin' you take
LINE 209: my money, but I hopes you ain' gwine ter use it fer none er dem
LINE 210: rakehelly gwines-on er yo'n,--gamblin' an' bettin' an' so fo'th. Yo'
LINE 211: grandaddy 'll fin' out 'bout you yit, ef you don' min' yo' P's an' Q's.
LINE 212: I does my bes' ter keep yo' misdoin's f'm 'im, an' sense I b'en tu'ned
LINE 213: out er de chu'ch--thoo no fault er my own, God knows!--I've tol' lies
LINE 214: 'nuff 'bout you ter sink a ship. But it ain't right, Mistuh Tom, it
LINE 215: ain't right! an' I only does it fer de sake er de fam'ly honuh, dat Mars
LINE 216: John sets so much sto' by, an' ter save his feelin's; fer de doctuh says
LINE 217: he mus'n' git ixcited 'bout nothin', er it mought bring on another
LINE 218: stroke."
LINE 219: "That's right, Sandy," replied Tom approvingly; "but the family honor is
LINE 220: as safe in my hands as in grandfather's own, and I'm going to use the
LINE 221: money for an excellent purpose, in fact to relieve a case of genuine
LINE 222: distress; and I'll hand it back to you in a day or two,--perhaps
LINE 223: to-morrow. Fetch me the money, Sandy,--that's a good darky!"
LINE 224: "All right, Mistuh Tom, you shill have de money; but I wants ter tell
LINE 225: you, suh, dat in all de yeahs I has wo'ked fer yo' gran'daddy, he has
LINE 226: never called me a 'darky' ter my face, suh. Co'se I knows dere's w'ite
LINE 227: folks an' black folks,--but dere's manners, suh, dere's manners, an'
LINE 228: gent'emen oughter be de ones ter use 'em, suh, ef dey ain't ter be
LINE 229: fergot enti'ely!"
LINE 230: "There, there, Sandy," returned Tom in a conciliatory tone, "I beg your
LINE 231: pardon! I've been associating with some Northern white folks at the
LINE 232: hotel, and picked up the word from them. You're a high-toned colored
LINE 233: gentleman, Sandy,--the finest one on the footstool."
LINE 234: Still muttering to himself, Sandy retired to his own room, which was in
LINE 235: the house, so that he might be always near his master. He soon returned
LINE 236: with a time-stained leather pocket-book and a coarse-knit cotton sock,
LINE 237: from which two receptacles he painfully extracted a number of bills and
LINE 238: coins.
LINE 239: "You count dat, Mistuh Tom, so I'll know how much I'm lettin' you have."
LINE 240: "This isn't worth anything," said Tom, pushing aside one roll of bills.
LINE 241: "It's Confederate money."
LINE 242: "So it is, suh. It ain't wuth nothin' now; but it has be'n money, an'
LINE 243: who kin tell but what it mought be money agin? De rest er dem bills is
LINE 244: greenbacks,--dey'll pass all right, I reckon."
LINE 245: The good money amounted to about fifty dollars, which Delamere thrust
LINE 246: eagerly into his pocket.
LINE 247: "You won't say anything to grandfather about this, will you, Sandy," he
LINE 248: said, as he turned away.
LINE 249: "No, suh, co'se I won't! Does I ever tell 'im 'bout yo' gwines-on? Ef I
LINE 250: did," he added to himself, as the young man disappeared down the street,
LINE 251: "I wouldn' have time ter do nothin' e'se ha'dly. I don' know whether
LINE 252: I'll ever see dat money agin er no, do' I 'magine de ole gent'eman
LINE 253: wouldn' lemme lose it ef he knowed. But I ain' gwine ter tell him,
LINE 254: whether I git my money back er no, fer he is jes' so wrop' up in dat boy
LINE 255: dat I b'lieve it'd jes' break his hea't ter fin' out how he's be'n
LINE 256: gwine on. Doctuh Price has tol' me not ter let de ole gent'eman git
LINE 257: ixcited, er e'se dere's no tellin' w'at mought happen. He's be'n good
LINE 258: ter me, he has, an' I'm gwine ter take keer er him,--dat's w'at I is,
LINE 259: ez long ez I has de chance."
LINE 260: * * * * *
LINE 261: Delamere went directly to the club, and soon lounged into the card-room,
LINE 262: where several of the members were engaged in play. He sauntered here and
LINE 263: there, too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice that the
LINE 264: greetings he received were less cordial than those usually exchanged
LINE 265: between the members of a small and select social club. Finally, when
LINE 266: Augustus, commonly and more appropriately called "Gus," Davidson came
LINE 267: into the room, Tom stepped toward him.
LINE 268: "Will you take a hand in a game, Gus?"
LINE 269: "Don't care if I do," said the other. "Let's sit over here."
LINE 270: Davidson led the way to a table near the fireplace, near which stood a
LINE 271: tall screen, which at times occupied various places in the room.
LINE 272: Davidson took the seat opposite the fireplace, leaving Delamere with his
LINE 273: back to the screen.
LINE 274: Delamere staked half of Sandy's money, and lost. He staked the rest, and
LINE 275: determined to win, because he could not afford to lose. He had just
LINE 276: reached out his hand to gather in the stakes, when he was charged with
LINE 277: cheating at cards, of which two members, who had quietly entered the
LINE 278: room and posted themselves behind the screen, had secured specific
LINE 279: proof. A meeting of the membership committee was hastily summoned, it
LINE 280: being an hour at which most of them might be found at the club. To avoid
LINE 281: a scandal, and to save the feelings of a prominent family, Delamere was
LINE 282: given an opportunity to resign quietly from the club, on condition that
LINE 283: he paid all his gambling debts within three days, and took an oath never
LINE 284: to play cards again for money. This latter condition was made at the
LINE 285: suggestion of an elderly member, who apparently believed that a man who
LINE 286: would cheat at cards would stick at perjury.
LINE 287: Delamere acquiesced very promptly. The taking of the oath was easy. The
LINE 288: payment of some fifteen hundred dollars of debts was a different matter.
LINE 289: He went away from the club thoughtfully, and it may be said, in full
LINE 290: justice to a past which was far from immaculate, that in his present
LINE 291: thoughts he touched a depth of scoundrelism far beyond anything of which
LINE 292: he had as yet deemed himself capable. When a man of good position, of
LINE 293: whom much is expected, takes to evil courses, his progress is apt to
LINE 294: resemble that of a well-bred woman who has started on the downward
LINE 295: path,--the pace is all the swifter because of the distance which must be
LINE 296: traversed to reach the bottom. Delamere had made rapid headway; having
LINE 297: hitherto played with sin, his servant had now become his master, and
LINE 298: held him in an iron grip.
