LINE 1: Wellington soon resumed its wonted calm, and in a few weeks the intended
LINE 2: lynching was only a memory. The robbery and assault, however, still
LINE 3: remained a mystery to all but a chosen few. The affair had been dropped
LINE 4: as absolutely as though it had never occurred. No colored man ever
LINE 5: learned the reason of this sudden change of front, and Sandy Campbell's
LINE 6: loyalty to his old employer's memory kept him silent. Tom Delamere did
LINE 7: not offer to retain Sandy in his service, though he presented him with
LINE 8: most of the old gentleman's wardrobe. It is only justice to Tom to state
LINE 9: that up to this time he had not been informed of the contents of his
LINE 10: grandfather's latest will. Major Carteret gave Sandy employment as
LINE 11: butler, thus making a sort of vicarious atonement, on the part of the
LINE 12: white race, of which the major felt himself in a way the embodiment, for
LINE 13: the risk to which Sandy had been subjected.
LINE 14: Shortly after these events Sandy was restored to the bosom of the
LINE 15: church, and, enfolded by its sheltering arms, was no longer tempted to
LINE 16: stray from the path of rectitude, but became even a more rigid Methodist
LINE 17: than before his recent troubles.
LINE 18: Tom Delamere did not call upon Clara again in the character of a lover.
LINE 19: Of course they could not help meeting, from time to time, but he never
LINE 20: dared presume upon their former relations. Indeed, the social
LINE 21: atmosphere of Wellington remained so frigid toward Delamere that he left
LINE 22: town, and did not return for several months.
LINE 23: Ellis was aware that Delamere had been thrown over, but a certain
LINE 24: delicacy restrained him from following up immediately the advantage
LINE 25: which the absence of his former rival gave him. It seemed to him, with
LINE 26: the quixotry of a clean, pure mind, that Clara would pass through a
LINE 27: period of mourning for her lost illusion, and that it would be
LINE 28: indelicate, for the time being, to approach her with a lover's
LINE 29: attentions. The work of the office had been unusually heavy of late. The
LINE 30: major, deeply absorbed in politics, left the detail work of the paper to
LINE 31: Ellis. Into the intimate counsels of the revolutionary committee Ellis
LINE 32: had not been admitted, nor would he have desired to be. He knew, of
LINE 33: course, in a general way, the results that it was sought to achieve; and
LINE 34: while he did not see their necessity, he deferred to the views of older
LINE 35: men, and was satisfied to remain in ignorance of anything which he might
LINE 36: disapprove. Moreover, his own personal affairs occupied his mind to an
LINE 37: extent that made politics or any other subject a matter of minor
LINE 38: importance.
LINE 39: As for Dr. Miller, he never learned of Mr. Delamere's good intentions
LINE 40: toward his institution, but regretted the old gentleman's death as the
LINE 41: loss of a sincere friend and well-wisher of his race in their unequal
LINE 42: struggle.
LINE 43: Despite the untiring zeal of Carteret and his associates, the campaign
LINE 44: for the restriction of the suffrage, which was to form the basis of a
LINE 45: permanent white supremacy, had seemed to languish for a while after the
LINE 46: Ochiltree affair. The lull, however, was only temporary, and more
LINE 47: apparent than real, for the forces adverse to the negro were merely
LINE 48: gathering strength for a more vigorous assault. While little was said in
LINE 49: Wellington, public sentiment all over the country became every day more
LINE 50: favorable to the views of the conspirators. The nation was rushing
LINE 51: forward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and world-dominion,
LINE 52: before the exigencies of which mere abstract ethical theories must not
LINE 53: be permitted to stand. The same argument that justified the conquest of
LINE 54: an inferior nation could not be denied to those who sought the
LINE 55: suppression of an inferior race. In the South, an obscure jealousy of
LINE 56: the negro's progress, an obscure fear of the very equality so
LINE 57: contemptuously denied, furnished a rich soil for successful agitation.
LINE 58: Statistics of crime, ingeniously manipulated, were made to present a
LINE 59: fearful showing against the negro. Vital statistics were made to prove
LINE 60: that he had degenerated from an imaginary standard of physical
LINE 61: excellence which had existed under the benign influence of slavery.
LINE 62: Constant lynchings emphasized his impotence, and bred everywhere a
LINE 63: growing contempt for his rights.
LINE 64: At the North, a new Pharaoh had risen, who knew not Israel,--a new
LINE 65: generation, who knew little of the fierce passions which had played
LINE 66: around the negro in a past epoch, and derived their opinions of him from
LINE 67: the "coon song" and the police reports. Those of his old friends who
LINE 68: survived were disappointed that he had not flown with clipped wings;
LINE 69: that he had not in one generation of limited opportunity attained the
LINE 70: level of the whites. The whole race question seemed to have reached a
LINE 71: sort of _impasse_, a blind alley, of which no one could see the outlet.
LINE 72: The negro had become a target at which any one might try a shot.
LINE 73: Schoolboys gravely debated the question as to whether or not the negro
LINE 74: should exercise the franchise. The pessimist gave him up in despair;
LINE 75: while the optimist, smilingly confident that everything would come out
LINE 76: all right in the end, also turned aside and went his buoyant way to more
LINE 77: pleasing themes.
LINE 78: For a time there were white men in the state who opposed any reactionary
LINE 79: step unless it were of general application. They were conscientious men,
LINE 80: who had learned the ten commandments and wished to do right; but this
LINE 81: class was a small minority, and their objections were soon silenced by
LINE 82: the all-powerful race argument. Selfishness is the most constant of
LINE 83: human motives. Patriotism, humanity, or the love of God may lead to
LINE 84: sporadic outbursts which sweep away the heaped-up wrongs of centuries;
LINE 85: but they languish at times, while the love of self works on ceaselessly,
LINE 86: unwearyingly, burrowing always at the very roots of life, and heaping up
LINE 87: fresh wrongs for other centuries to sweep away. The state was at the
LINE 88: mercy of venal and self-seeking politicians, bent upon regaining their
LINE 89: ascendency at any cost, stultifying their own minds by vague sophistries
LINE 90: and high-sounding phrases, which deceived none but those who wished to
LINE 91: be deceived, and these but imperfectly; and dulling the public
LINE 92: conscience by a loud clamor in which the calm voice of truth was for the
LINE 93: moment silenced. So the cause went on.
LINE 94: Carteret, as spokesman of the campaign, and sincerest of all its
LINE 95: leaders, performed prodigies of labor. The Morning Chronicle proclaimed,
LINE 96: in season and out, the doctrine of "White Supremacy." Leaving the paper
LINE 97: in charge of Ellis, the major made a tour of the state, rousing the
LINE 98: white people of the better class to an appreciation of the terrible
LINE 99: danger which confronted them in the possibility that a few negroes might
LINE 100: hold a few offices or dictate the terms upon which white men should fill
LINE 101: them. Difficulties were explained away. The provisions of the Federal
LINE 102: Constitution, it was maintained, must yield to the "higher law," and if
LINE 103: the Constitution could neither be altered nor bent to this end, means
LINE 104: must be found to circumvent it.
LINE 105: The device finally hit upon for disfranchising the colored people in
LINE 106: this particular state was the notorious "grandfather clause." After
LINE 107: providing various restrictions of the suffrage, based upon education,
LINE 108: character, and property, which it was deemed would in effect
LINE 109: disfranchise the colored race, an exception was made in favor of all
LINE 110: citizens whose fathers or grandfathers had been entitled to vote prior
LINE 111: to 1867. Since none but white men could vote prior to 1867, this
LINE 112: exception obviously took in the poor and ignorant whites, while the same
LINE 113: class of negroes were excluded.
LINE 114: It was ingenious, but it was not fair. In due time a constitutional
LINE 115: convention was called, in which the above scheme was adopted and
LINE 116: submitted to a vote of the people for ratification. The campaign was
LINE 117: fought on the color line. Many white Republicans, deluded with the hope
LINE 118: that by the elimination of the negro vote their party might receive
LINE 119: accessions from the Democratic ranks, went over to the white party. By
LINE 120: fraud in one place, by terrorism in another, and everywhere by the
LINE 121: resistless moral force of the united whites, the negroes were reduced to
LINE 122: the apathy of despair, their few white allies demoralized, and the
LINE 123: amendment adopted by a large majority. The negroes were taught that
LINE 124: this is a white man's country, and that the sooner they made up their
LINE 125: minds to this fact, the better for all concerned. The white people would
LINE 126: be good to them so long as they behaved themselves and kept their place.
LINE 127: As theoretical equals,--practical equality being forever out of the
LINE 128: question, either by nature or by law,--there could have been nothing but
LINE 129: strife between them, in which the weaker party would invariably have
LINE 130: suffered most.
LINE 131: Some colored men accepted the situation thus outlined, if not as
LINE 132: desirable, at least as inevitable. Most of them, however, had little
LINE 133: faith in this condescending friendliness which was to take the place of
LINE 134: constitutional rights. They knew they had been treated unfairly; that
LINE 135: their enemies had prevailed against them; that their whilom friends had
LINE 136: stood passively by and seen them undone. Many of the most enterprising
LINE 137: and progressive left the state, and those who remain still labor under a
LINE 138: sense of wrong and outrage which renders them distinctly less valuable
LINE 139: as citizens.
LINE 140: The great steal was made, but the thieves did not turn honest,--the
LINE 141: scheme still shows the mark of the burglar's tools. Sins, like chickens,
LINE 142: come home to roost. The South paid a fearful price for the wrong of
LINE 143: negro slavery; in some form or other it will doubtless reap the fruits
LINE 144: of this later iniquity.
LINE 145: Drastic as were these "reforms," the results of which we have
LINE 146: anticipated somewhat, since the new Constitution was not to take effect
LINE 147: immediately, they moved all too slowly for the little coterie of
LINE 148: Wellington conspirators, whose ambitions and needs urged them to prompt
LINE 149: action. Under the new Constitution it would be two full years before the
LINE 150: "nigger amendment" became effective, and meanwhile the Wellington
LINE 151: district would remain hopelessly Republican. The committee decided,
LINE 152: about two months before the fall election, that an active local campaign
LINE 153: must be carried on, with a view to discourage the negroes from attending
LINE 154: the polls on election day.
LINE 155: The question came up for discussion one forenoon in a meeting at the
LINE 156: office of the Morning Chronicle, at which all of the "Big Three" were
LINE 157: present.
LINE 158: "Something must be done," declared McBane, "and that damn quick. Too
LINE 159: many white people are saying that it will be better to wait until the
LINE 160: amendment goes into effect. That would mean to leave the niggers in
LINE 161: charge of this town for two years after the state has declared for white
LINE 162: supremacy! I'm opposed to leaving it in their hands one hour,--them's
LINE 163: my sentiments!"
LINE 164: This proved to be the general opinion, and the discussion turned to the
LINE 165: subject of ways and means.
LINE 166: "What became of that editorial in the nigger paper?" inquired the
LINE 167: general in his blandest tones, cleverly directing a smoke ring toward
LINE 168: the ceiling. "It lost some of its point back there, when we came near
LINE 169: lynching that nigger; but now that that has blown over, why wouldn't it
LINE 170: be a good thing to bring into play at the present juncture? Let's read
LINE 171: it over again."
LINE 172: Carteret extracted the paper from the pigeon-hole where he had placed it
LINE 173: some months before. The article was read aloud with emphasis and
LINE 174: discussed phrase by phrase. Of its wording there could be little
LINE 175: criticism,--it was temperately and even cautiously phrased. As
LINE 176: suggested by the general, the Ochiltree affair had proved that it was
LINE 177: not devoid of truth. Its great offensiveness lay in its boldness: that a
LINE 178: negro should publish in a newspaper what white people would scarcely
LINE 179: acknowledge to themselves in secret was much as though a Russian
LINE 180: _moujik_ or a German peasant should rush into print to question the
LINE 181: divine right of the Lord's Anointed. The article was racial
LINE 182: _lèse-majesté_ in the most aggravated form. A peg was needed upon which
LINE 183: to hang a _coup d'état_, and this editorial offered the requisite
LINE 184: opportunity. It was unanimously decided to republish the obnoxious
LINE 185: article, with comment adapted to fire the inflammable Southern heart and
LINE 186: rouse it against any further self-assertion of the negroes in politics
LINE 187: or elsewhere.
LINE 188: "The time is ripe!" exclaimed McBane. "In a month we can have the
LINE 189: niggers so scared that they won't dare stick their heads out of doors on
LINE 190: 'lection day."
LINE 191: "I wonder," observed the general thoughtfully, after this conclusion had
LINE 192: been reached, "if we couldn't have Jerry fetch us some liquor?"
LINE 193: Jerry appeared in response to the usual summons. The general gave him
LINE 194: the money, and ordered three Calhoun cocktails. When Jerry returned with
LINE 195: the glasses on a tray, the general observed him with pointed curiosity.
LINE 196: "What, in h--ll is the matter with you, Jerry? Your black face is
LINE 197: splotched with brown and yellow patches, and your hair shines as though
LINE 198: you had fallen head-foremost into a firkin of butter. What's the matter
LINE 199: with you?"
LINE 200: Jerry seemed much embarrassed by this inquiry.
LINE 201: "Nothin', suh, nothin'," he stammered. "It's--it's jes' somethin' I
LINE 202: be'n puttin' on my hair, suh, ter improve de quality, suh."
LINE 203: "Jerry," returned the general, bending a solemn look upon the porter,
LINE 204: "you have been playing with edged tools, and your days are numbered. You
LINE 205: have been reading the Afro-American Banner."
LINE 206: He shook open the paper, which he had retained in his hand, and read
LINE 207: from one of the advertisements:--
LINE 208: "'Kinky, curly hair made straight in two applications. Dark skins
LINE 209: lightened two shades; mulattoes turned perfectly white.'
LINE 210: "This stuff is rank poison, Jerry," continued the general with a mock
LINE 211: solemnity which did not impose upon Jerry, who nevertheless listened
LINE 212: with an air of great alarm. He suspected that the general was making fun
LINE 213: of him; but he also knew that the general would like to think that Jerry
LINE 214: believed him in earnest; and to please the white folks was Jerry's
LINE 215: consistent aim in life. "I can see the signs of decay in your face, and
LINE 216: your hair will all fall out in a week or two at the latest,--mark my
LINE 217: words!"
LINE 218: McBane had listened to this pleasantry with a sardonic sneer. It was a
LINE 219: waste of valuable time. To Carteret it seemed in doubtful taste. These
LINE 220: grotesque advertisements had their tragic side. They were proof that the
LINE 221: negroes had read the handwriting on the wall. These pitiful attempts to
LINE 222: change their physical characteristics were an acknowledgment, on their
LINE 223: own part, that the negro was doomed, and that the white man was to
LINE 224: inherit the earth and hold all other races under his heel. For, as the
LINE 225: months had passed, Carteret's thoughts, centring more and more upon the
LINE 226: negro, had led him farther and farther, until now he was firmly
LINE 227: convinced that there was no permanent place for the negro in the United
LINE 228: States, if indeed anywhere in the world, except under the ground. More
LINE 229: pathetic even than Jerry's efforts to escape from the universal doom of
LINE 230: his race was his ignorance that even if he could, by some strange
LINE 231: alchemy, bleach his skin and straighten his hair, there would still
LINE 232: remain, underneath it all, only the unbleached darky,--the ass in the
LINE 233: lion's skin.
LINE 234: When the general had finished his facetious lecture, Jerry backed out of
LINE 235: the room shamefacedly, though affecting a greater confusion than he
LINE 236: really felt. Jerry had not reasoned so closely as Carteret, but he had
LINE 237: realized that it was a distinct advantage to be white,--an advantage
LINE 238: which white people had utilized to secure all the best things in the
LINE 239: world; and he had entertained the vague hope that by changing his
LINE 240: complexion he might share this prerogative. While he suspected the
LINE 241: general's sincerity, he nevertheless felt a little apprehensive lest the
LINE 242: general's prediction about the effects of the face-bleach and other
LINE 243: preparations might prove true,--the general was a white gentleman and
LINE 244: ought to know,--and decided to abandon their use.
LINE 245: This purpose was strengthened by his next interview with the major. When
LINE 246: Carteret summoned him, an hour later, after the other gentlemen had
LINE 247: taken their leave, Jerry had washed his head thoroughly and there
LINE 248: remained no trace of the pomade. An attempt to darken the lighter spots
LINE 249: in his cuticle by the application of printer's ink had not proved
LINE 250: equally successful,--the retouching left the spots as much too dark as
LINE 251: they had formerly been too light.
LINE 252: "Jerry," said Carteret sternly, "when I hired you to work for the
LINE 253: Chronicle, you were black. The word 'negro' means 'black.' The best
LINE 254: negro is a black negro, of the pure type, as it came from the hand of
LINE 255: God. If you wish to get along well with the white people, the blacker
LINE 256: you are the better,--white people do not like negroes who want to be
LINE 257: white. A man should be content to remain as God made him and where God
LINE 258: placed him. So no more of this nonsense. Are you going to vote at the
LINE 259: next election?"
LINE 260: "What would you 'vise me ter do, suh?" asked Jerry cautiously.
LINE 261: "I do not advise you. You ought to have sense enough to see where your
LINE 262: own interests lie. I put it to you whether you cannot trust yourself
LINE 263: more safely in the hands of white gentlemen, who are your true friends,
LINE 264: than in the hands of ignorant and purchasable negroes and unscrupulous
LINE 265: white scoundrels?"
LINE 266: "Dere's no doubt about it, suh," assented Jerry, with a vehemence
LINE 267: proportioned to his desire to get back into favor. "I ain' gwine ter
LINE 268: have nothin' ter do wid de 'lection, suh! Ef I don' vote, I kin keep my
LINE 269: job, can't I, suh?"
LINE 270: The major eyed Jerry with an air of supreme disgust. What could be
LINE 271: expected of a race so utterly devoid of tact? It seemed as though this
LINE 272: negro thought a white gentleman might want to bribe him to remain away
LINE 273: from the polls; and the negro's willingness to accept the imaginary
LINE 274: bribe demonstrated the venal nature of the colored race,--its entire
LINE 275: lack of moral principle!
LINE 276: "You will retain your place, Jerry," he said severely, "so long as you
LINE 277: perform your duties to my satisfaction and behave yourself properly."
LINE 278: With this grandiloquent subterfuge Carteret turned to his next article
LINE 279: on white supremacy. Jerry did not delude himself with any fine-spun
LINE 280: sophistry. He knew perfectly well that he held his job upon the
LINE 281: condition that he stayed away from the polls at the approaching
LINE 282: election. Jerry was a fool--
LINE 283: "The world of fools hath such a store,
LINE 284: That he who would not see an ass,
LINE 285: Must stay at home and shut his door
LINE 286: And break his looking-glass."
LINE 287: But while no one may be entirely wise, there are degrees of folly, and
LINE 288: Jerry was not all kinds of a fool.
