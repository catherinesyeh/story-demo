LINE 1: As a stone dropped into a pool of water sets in motion a series of
LINE 2: concentric circles which disturb the whole mass in varying degree, so
LINE 3: Mrs. Ochiltree's enigmatical remark had started in her niece's mind a
LINE 4: disturbing train of thought. Had her words, Mrs. Carteret asked herself,
LINE 5: any serious meaning, or were they the mere empty babblings of a clouded
LINE 6: intellect?
LINE 7: "William," she said to the coachman when they reached Mrs. Ochiltree's
LINE 8: house, "you may tie the horse and help us out. I shall be here a little
LINE 9: while."
LINE 10: William helped the ladies down, assisted Mrs. Ochiltree into the house,
LINE 11: and then went round to the kitchen. Dinah was an excellent hand at
LINE 12: potato-pone and other culinary delicacies dear to the Southern heart,
LINE 13: and William was a welcome visitor in her domain.
LINE 14: "Now, Aunt Polly," said Mrs. Carteret resolutely, as soon as they were
LINE 15: alone, "I want to know what you meant by what you said about my father
LINE 16: and Julia, and this--this child of hers?"
LINE 17: The old woman smiled cunningly, but her expression soon changed to one
LINE 18: more grave.
LINE 19: "Why do you want to know?" she asked suspiciously. "You've got the
LINE 20: land, the houses, and the money. You've nothing to complain of. Enjoy
LINE 21: yourself, and be thankful!"
LINE 22: "I'm thankful to God," returned Olivia, "for all his good gifts,--and
LINE 23: He has blessed me abundantly,--but why should I be thankful to _you_ for
LINE 24: the property my father left me?"
LINE 25: "Why should you be thankful to me?" rejoined Mrs. Ochiltree with
LINE 26: querulous indignation. "You'd better ask why _shouldn't_ you be
LINE 27: thankful to me. What have I not done for you?"
LINE 28: "Yes, Aunt Polly, I know you've done a great deal. You reared me in
LINE 29: your own house when I had been cast out of my father's; you have been a
LINE 30: second mother to me, and I am very grateful,--you can never say that I
LINE 31: have not shown my gratitude. But if you have done anything else for me,
LINE 32: I wish to know it. Why should I thank you for my inheritance?"
LINE 33: "Why should you thank me? Well, because I drove that woman and her brat
LINE 34: away."
LINE 35: "But she had no right to stay, Aunt Polly, after father died. Of course
LINE 36: she had no moral right before, but it was his house, and he could keep
LINE 37: her there if he chose. But after his death she surely had no right."
LINE 38: "Perhaps not so surely as you think,--if she had not been a negro. Had
LINE 39: she been white, there might have been a difference. When I told her to
LINE 40: go, she said"--
LINE 41: "What did she say, Aunt Polly," demanded Olivia eagerly.
LINE 42: It seemed for a moment as though Mrs. Ochiltree would speak no further:
LINE 43: but her once strong will, now weakened by her bodily infirmities,
LINE 44: yielded to the influence of her niece's imperious demand.
LINE 45: "I'll tell you the whole story," she said, "and then you'll know what
LINE 46: I did for you and yours." Mrs. Ochiltree's eyes assumed an
LINE 47: introspective expression, and her story, as it advanced, became as
LINE 48: keenly dramatic as though memory had thrown aside the veil of
LINE 49: intervening years and carried her back directly to the events which she
LINE 50: now described.
LINE 51: "Your father," she said, "while living with that woman, left home one
LINE 52: morning the picture of health. Five minutes later he tottered into the
LINE 53: house groaning with pain, stricken unto death by the hand of a just God,
LINE 54: as a punishment for his sins."
LINE 55: Olivia gave a start of indignation, but restrained herself.
LINE 56: "I was at once informed of what had happened, for I had means of knowing
LINE 57: all that took place in the household. Old Jane--she was younger
LINE 58: then--had come with you to my house; but her daughter remained, and
LINE 59: through her I learned all that went on.
LINE 60: "I hastened immediately to the house, entered without knocking, and
LINE 61: approached Mr. Merkell's bedroom, which was on the lower floor and
LINE 62: opened into the hall. The door was ajar, and as I stood there for a
LINE 63: moment I heard your father's voice.
LINE 64: "'Listen, Julia,' he was saying. 'I shall not live until the doctor
LINE 65: comes. But I wish you to know, dear Julia!'--he called her 'dear
LINE 66: Julia!'--'before I die, that I have kept my promise. You did me one
LINE 67: great service, Julia,--you saved me from Polly Ochiltree!' Yes, Olivia,
LINE 68: that is what he said! 'You have served me faithfully and well, and I owe
LINE 69: you a great deal, which I have tried to pay.'
LINE 70: "'Oh, Mr. Merkell, dear Mr. Merkell,' cried the hypocritical hussy,
LINE 71: falling to her knees by his bedside, and shedding her crocodile tears,
LINE 72: 'you owe me nothing. You have done more for me than I could ever repay.
LINE 73: You will not die and leave me,--no, no, it cannot be!'
LINE 74: "'Yes, I am going to die,--I am dying now, Julia. But listen,--compose
LINE 75: yourself and listen, for this is a more important matter. Take the keys
LINE 76: from under my pillow, open the desk in the next room, look in the second
LINE 77: drawer on the right, and you will find an envelope containing three
LINE 78: papers: one of them is yours, one is the paper I promised to make, and
LINE 79: the third is a letter which I wrote last night. As soon as the breath
LINE 80: has left my body, deliver the envelope to the address indorsed upon it.
LINE 81: Do not delay one moment, or you may live to regret it. Say nothing until
LINE 82: you have delivered the package, and then be guided by the advice which
LINE 83: you receive,--it will come from a friend of mine who will not see you
LINE 84: wronged.'
LINE 85: "I slipped away from the door without making my presence known and
LINE 86: entered, by a door from the hall, the room adjoining the one where Mr.
LINE 87: Merkell lay. A moment later there was a loud scream. Returning quickly
LINE 88: to the hall, I entered Mr. Merkell's room as though just arrived.
LINE 89: "'How is Mr. Merkell?' I demanded, as I crossed the threshold.
LINE 90: "'He is dead,' sobbed the woman, without lifting her head,--she had
LINE 91: fallen on her knees by the bedside. She had good cause to weep, for my
LINE 92: time had come.
LINE 93: "'Get up,' I said. 'You have no right here. You pollute Mr. Merkell's
LINE 94: dead body by your touch. Leave the house immediately,--your day is
LINE 95: over!'
LINE 96: "'I will not!' she cried, rising to her feet and facing me with
LINE 97: brazen-faced impudence. 'I have a right to stay,--he has given me the
LINE 98: right!'
LINE 99: "'Ha, ha!' I laughed. 'Mr. Merkell is dead, and I am mistress here
LINE 100: henceforth. Go, and go at once,--do you hear?'
LINE 101: "'I hear, but I shall not heed. I can prove my rights! I shall not
LINE 102: leave!'
LINE 103: "'Very well,' I replied, 'we shall see. The law will decide.'
LINE 104: "I left the room, but did not leave the house. On the contrary, I
LINE 105: concealed myself where I could see what took place in the room adjoining
LINE 106: the death-chamber.
LINE 107: "She entered the room a moment later, with her child on one arm and the
LINE 108: keys in the other hand. Placing the child on the floor, she put the key
LINE 109: in the lock, and seemed surprised to find the desk already unfastened.
LINE 110: She opened the desk, picked up a roll of money and a ladies' watch,
LINE 111: which first caught her eye, and was reaching toward the drawer upon the
LINE 112: right, when I interrupted her:--
LINE 113: "'Well, thief, are you trying to strip the house before you leave it?'
LINE 114: "She gave an involuntary cry, clasped one hand to her bosom and with the
LINE 115: other caught up her child, and stood like a wild beast at bay.
LINE 116: "'I am not a thief,' she panted. 'The things are mine!'
LINE 117: "'You lie,' I replied. 'You have no right to them,--no more right than
LINE 118: you have to remain in this house!'
LINE 119: "'I have a right,' she persisted, 'and I can prove it!'
LINE 120: "She turned toward the desk, seized the drawer, and drew it open. Never
LINE 121: shall I forget her look,--never shall I forget that moment; it was the
LINE 122: happiest of my life. The drawer was empty!
LINE 123: "Pale as death she turned and faced me.
LINE 124: "'The papers!' she shrieked, 'the papers! _You_ have stolen them!'
LINE 125: "'Papers?' I laughed, 'what papers? Do you take me for a thief, like
LINE 126: yourself?'
LINE 127: "'There were papers here,' she cried, 'only a minute since. They are
LINE 128: mine,--give them back to me!'
LINE 129: "'Listen, woman,' I said sternly, 'you are lying--or dreaming. My
LINE 130: brother-in-law's papers are doubtless in his safe at his office, where
LINE 131: they ought to be. As for the rest,--you are a thief.'
LINE 132: "'I am not,' she screamed; 'I am his wife. He married me, and the papers
LINE 133: that were in the desk will prove it.'
LINE 134: "'Listen,' I exclaimed, when she had finished,--'listen carefully, and
LINE 135: take heed to what I say. You are a liar. You have no proofs,--there
LINE 136: never were any proofs of what you say, because it never happened,--it is
LINE 137: absurd upon the face of it. Not one person in Wellington would believe
LINE 138: it. Why should he marry you? He did not need to! You are merely
LINE 139: lying,--you are not even self-deceived. If he had really married you,
LINE 140: you would have made it known long ago. That you did not is proof that
LINE 141: your story is false.'
LINE 142: "She was hit so hard that she trembled and sank into a chair. But I had
LINE 143: no mercy--she had saved your father from _me_--'dear Julia,' indeed!
LINE 144: "'Stand up,' I ordered. 'Do not dare to sit down in my presence. I have
LINE 145: you on the hip, my lady, and will teach you your place.'
LINE 146: "She struggled to her feet, and stood supporting herself with one hand
LINE 147: on the chair. I could have killed her, Olivia! She had been my father's
LINE 148: slave; if it had been before the war, I would have had her whipped to
LINE 149: death.
LINE 150: "'You are a thief,' I said, 'and of that there _are_ proofs. I have
LINE 151: caught you in the act. The watch in your bosom is my own, the money
LINE 152: belongs to Mr. Merkell's estate, which belongs to my niece, his daughter
LINE 153: Olivia. I saw you steal them. My word is worth yours a hundred times
LINE 154: over, for I am a lady, and you are--what? And now hear me: if ever you
LINE 155: breathe to a living soul one word of this preposterous story, I will
LINE 156: charge you with the theft, and have you sent to the penitentiary. Your
LINE 157: child will be taken from you, and you shall never see it again. I will
LINE 158: give you now just ten minutes to take your brat and your rags out of
LINE 159: this house forever. But before you go, put down your plunder there upon
LINE 160: the desk!'
LINE 161: "She laid down the money and the watch, and a few minutes later left the
LINE 162: house with the child in her arms.
LINE 163: "And now, Olivia, you know how I saved your estate, and why you should
LINE 164: be grateful to me."
LINE 165: Olivia had listened to her aunt's story with intense interest. Having
LINE 166: perceived the old woman's mood, and fearful lest any interruption might
LINE 167: break the flow of her narrative, she had with an effort kept back the
LINE 168: one question which had been hovering upon her lips, but which could now
LINE 169: no longer be withheld.
LINE 170: "What became of the papers, Aunt Polly?"
LINE 171: "Ha, ha!" chuckled Mrs. Ochiltree with a cunning look, "did I not tell
LINE 172: you that she found no papers?"
LINE 173: A change had come over Mrs. Ochiltree's face, marking the reaction from
LINE 174: her burst of energy. Her eyes were half closed, and she was muttering
LINE 175: incoherently. Olivia made some slight effort to arouse her, but in vain,
LINE 176: and realizing the futility of any further attempt to extract information
LINE 177: from her aunt at this time, she called William and drove homeward.
