LINE 1: The iron bolt rattled in the lock, the door of a cell swung open, and
LINE 2: when Mr. Delamere had entered was quickly closed again.
LINE 3: "Well, Sandy!"
LINE 4: "Oh, Mars John! Is you fell from hebben ter he'p me out er here? I
LINE 5: prayed de Lawd ter sen' you, an' He answered my prayer, an' here you is,
LINE 6: Mars John,--here you is! Oh, Mars John, git me out er dis place!"
LINE 7: "Tut, tut, Sandy!" answered his master; "of course I'll get you out.
LINE 8: That's what I've come for. How in the world did such a mistake ever
LINE 9: happen? You would no more commit such a crime than I would!"
LINE 10: "No, suh, 'deed I wouldn', an' you know I wouldn'! I wouldn' want ter
LINE 11: bring no disgrace on de fam'ly dat raise' me, ner ter make no trouble
LINE 12: fer you, suh; but here I is, suh, lock' up in jail, an' folks talkin'
LINE 13: 'bout hangin' me fer somethin' dat never entered my min', suh. I swea'
LINE 14: ter God I never thought er sech a thing!"
LINE 15: "Of course you didn't, Sandy," returned Mr. Delamere soothingly; "and
LINE 16: now the next thing, and the simplest thing, is to get you out of this.
LINE 17: I'll speak to the officers, and at the preliminary hearing to-morrow I'll
LINE 18: tell them all about you, and they will let you go. You won't mind
LINE 19: spending one night in jail for your sins."
LINE 20: "No, suh, ef I wuz sho' I'd be 'lowed ter spen' it here. But dey say dey
LINE 21: 're gwine ter lynch me ternight,--I kin hear 'em talkin' f'm de winders
LINE 22: er de cell, suh."
LINE 23: "Well, _I_ say, Sandy, that they shall do no such thing! Lynch a man
LINE 24: brought up by a Delamere, for a crime of which he is innocent?
LINE 25: Preposterous! I'll speak to the authorities and see that you are
LINE 26: properly protected until this mystery is unraveled. If Tom had been
LINE 27: here, he would have had you out before now, Sandy. My grandson is a
LINE 28: genuine Delamere, is he not, Sandy?"
LINE 29: "Yas, suh, yas, suh," returned Sandy, with a lack of enthusiasm which he
LINE 30: tried to conceal from his master. "An' I s'pose ef he hadn' gone
LINE 31: fishin' so soon dis mawnin', he'd 'a' be'n lookin' after me, suh."
LINE 32: "It has been my love for him and your care of me, Sandy," said the old
LINE 33: gentleman tremulously, "that have kept me alive so long; but now explain
LINE 34: to me everything concerning this distressing matter, and I shall then be
LINE 35: able to state your case to better advantage."
LINE 36: "Well, suh," returned Sandy, "I mought's well tell de whole tale an' not
LINE 37: hol' nothin' back. I wuz kind er lonesome las' night, an' sence I be'n
LINE 38: tu'ned outen de chu'ch on account er dat cakewalk I didn' go ter, so
LINE 39: he'p me God! I didn' feel like gwine ter prayer-meetin', so I went
LINE 40: roun' ter see Solomon Williams, an' he wa'n't home, an' den I walk' down
LINE 41: street an' met Josh Green, an' he ax' me inter Sam Taylor's place, an' I
LINE 42: sot roun' dere wid Josh till 'bout 'leven o'clock, w'en I sta'ted back
LINE 43: home. I went straight ter de house, suh, an' went ter bed an' ter sleep
LINE 44: widout sayin' a wo'd ter a single soul excep' Mistuh Tom, who wuz
LINE 45: settin' up readin' a book w'en I come in. I wish I may drap dead in my
LINE 46: tracks, suh, ef dat ain't de God's truf, suh, eve'y wo'd of it!"
LINE 47: "I believe every word of it, Sandy; now tell me about the clothes that
LINE 48: you are said to have been found cleaning, and the suspicious articles
LINE 49: that were found in your room?"
LINE 50: "Dat's w'at beats me, Mars John," replied Sandy, shaking his head
LINE 51: mournfully. "Wen I lef home las' night after supper, my clo's wuz all
LINE 52: put erway in de closet in my room, folded up on de she'f ter keep de
LINE 53: moths out. Dey wuz my good clo's,--de blue coat dat you wo' ter de
LINE 54: weddin' fo'ty years ago, an' dem dere plaid pants I gun Mistuh Cohen fo'
LINE 55: dollars fer three years ago; an' w'en I looked in my closet dis mawnin',
LINE 56: suh, befo' I got ready ter sta't fer Belleview, dere wuz my clo's layin'
LINE 57: on de flo', all muddy an' crumple' up, des lack somebody had wo' 'em in
LINE 58: a fight! Somebody e'se had wo' my clo's,--er e'se dere'd be'n some
LINE 59: witchcraf, er some sort er devilment gwine on dat I can't make out, suh,
LINE 60: ter save my soul!"
LINE 61: "There was no witchcraft, Sandy, but that there was some deviltry might
LINE 62: well be. Now, what other negro, who might have been mistaken for you,
LINE 63: could have taken your clothes? Surely no one about the house?"
LINE 64: "No, suh, no, suh. It couldn't 'a' be'n Jeff, fer he wuz at Belleview
LINE 65: wid you; an' it couldn't 'a' be'n Billy, fer he wuz too little ter wear
LINE 66: my clo's; an' it couldn't 'a' be'n Sally, fer she's a 'oman. It's a
LINE 67: myst'ry ter me, suh!"
LINE 68: "Have you no enemies? Is there any one in Wellington whom you imagine
LINE 69: would like to do you an injury?"
LINE 70: "Not a livin' soul dat I knows of, suh. I've be'n tu'ned out'n de
LINE 71: chu'ch, but I don' know who my enemy is dere, er ef it wuz all a
LINE 72: mistake, like dis yer jailin' is; but de Debbil is in dis somewhar, Mars
LINE 73: John,--an' I got my reasons fer sayin' so."
LINE 74: "What do you mean, Sandy?"
LINE 75: Sandy related his experience of the preceding evening: how he had seen
LINE 76: the apparition preceding him to the house, and how he had questioned Tom
LINE 77: upon the subject.
LINE 78: "There's some mystery here, Sandy," said Mr. Delamere reflectively.
LINE 79: "Have you told me all, now, upon your honor? I am trying to save your
LINE 80: life, Sandy, and I must be able to trust your word implicitly. You must
LINE 81: tell me every circumstance; a very little and seemingly unimportant bit
LINE 82: of evidence may sometimes determine the issue of a great lawsuit. There
LINE 83: is one thing especially, Sandy: where did you get the gold which was
LINE 84: found in your trunk?"
LINE 85: Sandy's face lit up with hopefulness.
LINE 86: "Why, Mars John, I kin 'splain dat part easy. Dat wuz money I had lent
LINE 87: out, an' I got back f'm--But no, suh, I promise' not ter tell."
LINE 88: "Circumstances absolve you from your promise, Sandy. Your life is of
LINE 89: more value to you than any other thing. If you will explain where you
LINE 90: got the gold, and the silk purse that contained it, which is said to be
LINE 91: Mrs. Ochiltree's, you will be back home before night."
LINE 92: Old Mr. Delamere's faculties, which had been waning somewhat in sympathy
LINE 93: with his health, were stirred to unusual acuteness by his servant's
LINE 94: danger. He was watching Sandy with all the awakened instincts of the
LINE 95: trial lawyer. He could see clearly enough that, in beginning to account
LINE 96: for the possession of the gold, Sandy had started off with his
LINE 97: explanation in all sincerity. At the mention of the silk purse, however,
LINE 98: his face had blanched to an ashen gray, and the words had frozen upon
LINE 99: his lips.
LINE 100: A less discerning observer might have taken these things as signs of
LINE 101: guilt, but not so Mr. Delamere.
LINE 102: "Well, Sandy," said his master encouragingly, "go on. You got the gold
LINE 103: from"--
LINE 104: Sandy remained silent. He had had a great shock, and had taken a great
LINE 105: resolution.
LINE 106: "Mars John," he asked dreamily, "you don' b'lieve dat I done dis thing?"
LINE 107: "Certainly not, Sandy, else why should I be here?"
LINE 108: "An' nothin' wouldn' make you b'lieve it, suh?"
LINE 109: "No, Sandy,--I could not believe it of you. I've known you too long and
LINE 110: too well."
LINE 111: "An' you wouldn' b'lieve it, not even ef I wouldn' say one wo'd mo'
LINE 112: about it?"
LINE 113: "No, Sandy, I believe you no more capable of this crime than I would
LINE 114: be,--or my grandson, Tom. I wish Tom were here, that he might help me
LINE 115: overcome your stubbornness; but you'll not be so foolish, so absurdly
LINE 116: foolish, Sandy, as to keep silent and risk your life merely to shield
LINE 117: some one else, when by speaking you might clear up this mystery and be
LINE 118: restored at once to liberty. Just tell me where you got the gold," added
LINE 119: the old gentleman persuasively. "Come, now, Sandy, that's a good
LINE 120: fellow!"
LINE 121: "Mars John," asked Sandy softly, "w'en my daddy, 'way back yander befo'
LINE 122: de wah, wuz about ter be sol' away f'm his wife an' child'en, you
LINE 123: bought him an' dem, an' kep' us all on yo' place tergether, didn't you,
LINE 124: suh?"
LINE 125: "Yes, Sandy, and he was a faithful servant, and proved worthy of all I
LINE 126: did for him."
LINE 127: "And w'en he had wo'ked fer you ten years, suh, you sot 'im free?"
LINE 128: "Yes, Sandy, he had earned his freedom."
LINE 129: "An' w'en de wah broke out, an' my folks wuz scattered, an' I didn'
LINE 130: have nothin' ter do ner nowhar ter go, you kep' me on yo' place, and
LINE 131: tuck me ter wait on you, suh, didn't you?"
LINE 132: "Yes, Sandy, and you have been a good servant and a good friend; but
LINE 133: tell me now about this gold, and I'll go and get you out of this, right
LINE 134: away, for I need you, Sandy, and you'll not be of any use to me shut up
LINE 135: here!"
LINE 136: "Jes' hol' on a minute befo' you go, Mars John; fer ef dem people
LINE 137: outside should git holt er me befo' you _does_ git me out er here, I may
LINE 138: never see you no mo', suh, in dis worl'. W'en Mars Billy McLean shot me
LINE 139: by mistake, w'ile we wuz out huntin' dat day, who wuz it boun' up my
LINE 140: woun's an' kep' me from bleedin' ter def, an' kyar'ed me two miles on
LINE 141: his own shoulders ter a doctuh?"
LINE 142: "Yes, Sandy, and when black Sally ran away with your young mistress and
LINE 143: Tom, when Tom was a baby, who stopped the runaway, and saved their lives
LINE 144: at the risk of his own?"
LINE 145: "Dat wa'n't nothin', suh; anybody could 'a' done dat, w'at wuz strong
LINE 146: ernuff an' swif' ernuff. You is be'n good ter me, suh, all dese years,
LINE 147: an' I've tried ter do my duty by you, suh, an' by Mistuh Tom, who wuz
LINE 148: yo' own gran'son, an' de las' one er de fam'ly."
LINE 149: "Yes, you have, Sandy, and when I am gone, which will not be very long,
LINE 150: Tom will take care of you, and see that you never want. But we are
LINE 151: wasting valuable time, Sandy, in these old reminiscences. Let us get back
LINE 152: to the present. Tell me about the gold, now, so that I may at once look
LINE 153: after your safety. It may not even be necessary for you to remain here
LINE 154: all night."
LINE 155: "Jes' one wo'd mo', Mars John, befo' you go! I know you're gwine ter do
LINE 156: de bes' you kin fer me, an' I'm sorry I can't he'p you no mo' wid it;
LINE 157: but ef dere should be any accident, er ef you _can't_ git me out er
LINE 158: here, don' bother yo' min' 'bout it no mo', suh, an' don' git yo'se'f
LINE 159: ixcited, fer you know de doctuh says, suh, dat you can't stan'
LINE 160: ixcitement; but jes' leave me in de han's er de Lawd, suh,--_He'll_ look
LINE 161: after me, here er hereafter. I know I've fell f'm grace mo' d'n once,
LINE 162: but I've done made my peace wid Him in dis here jail-house, suh, an' I
LINE 163: ain't 'feared ter die--ef I haf ter. I ain' got no wife ner child'n ter
LINE 164: mo'n fer me, an' I'll die knowin' dat I've done my duty ter dem dat
LINE 165: hi'ed me, an' trusted me, an' had claims on me. Fer I wuz raise' by a
LINE 166: Delamere, suh, an' all de ole Delameres wuz gent'emen, an' deir
LINE 167: principles spread ter de niggers 'round 'em, suh; an' ef I has ter die
LINE 168: fer somethin' I didn' do,--I kin die, suh, like a gent'eman! But ez fer
LINE 169: dat gol', suh, I ain' gwine ter say one wo'd mo' 'bout it ter nobody in
LINE 170: dis worl'!"
LINE 171: Nothing could shake Sandy's determination. Mr. Delamere argued,
LINE 172: expostulated, but all in vain. Sandy would not speak.
LINE 173: More and more confident of some mystery, which would come out in time,
LINE 174: if properly investigated, Mr. Delamere, strangely beset by a vague
LINE 175: sense of discomfort over and beyond that occasioned by his servant's
LINE 176: danger, hurried away upon his errand of mercy. He felt less confident of
LINE 177: the outcome than when he had entered the jail, but was quite as much
LINE 178: resolved that no effort should be spared to secure protection for Sandy
LINE 179: until there had been full opportunity for the truth to become known.
LINE 180: "Take good care of your prisoner, sheriff," he said sternly, as he was
LINE 181: conducted to the door. "He will not be long in your custody, and I shall
LINE 182: see that you are held strictly accountable for his safety."
LINE 183: "I'll do what I can, sir," replied the sheriff in an even tone and
LINE 184: seemingly not greatly impressed by this warning. "If the prisoner is
LINE 185: taken from me, it will be because the force that comes for him is too
LINE 186: strong for resistance."
LINE 187: "There should be no force too strong for an honest man in your position
LINE 188: to resist,--whether successfully or not is beyond the question. The
LINE 189: officer who is intimidated by threats, or by his own fears, is recreant
LINE 190: to his duty, and no better than the mob which threatens him. But you
LINE 191: will have no such test, Mr. Wemyss! I shall see to it myself that there
LINE 192: is no violence!"
