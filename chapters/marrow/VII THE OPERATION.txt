LINE 1: Dr. Price was not entirely at ease in his mind as the two doctors drove
LINE 2: rapidly from the hotel to Major Carteret's. Himself a liberal man, from
LINE 3: his point of view, he saw no reason why a colored doctor might not
LINE 4: operate upon a white male child,--there are fine distinctions in the
LINE 5: application of the color line,--but several other physicians had been
LINE 6: invited, some of whom were men of old-fashioned notions, who might not
LINE 7: relish such an innovation.
LINE 8: This, however, was but a small difficulty compared with what might be
LINE 9: feared from Major Carteret himself. For he knew Carteret's unrelenting
LINE 10: hostility to anything that savored of recognition of the negro as the
LINE 11: equal of white men. It was traditional in Wellington that no colored
LINE 12: person had ever entered the front door of the Carteret residence, and
LINE 13: that the luckless individual who once presented himself there upon
LINE 14: alleged business and resented being ordered to the back door had been
LINE 15: unceremoniously thrown over the piazza railing into a rather thorny
LINE 16: clump of rosebushes below. If Miller were going as a servant, to hold a
LINE 17: basin or a sponge, there would be no difficulty; but as a surgeon--well,
LINE 18: he wouldn't borrow trouble. Under the circumstances the major might
LINE 19: yield a point.
LINE 20: But as they neared the house the major's unyielding disposition loomed
LINE 21: up formidably. Perhaps if the matter were properly presented to Dr.
LINE 22: Burns, he might consent to withdraw the invitation. It was not yet too,
LINE 23: late to send Miller a note.
LINE 24: "By the way, Dr. Burns," he said, "I'm very friendly to Dr. Miller, and
LINE 25: should personally like to have him with us to-night. But--I ought to
LINE 26: have told you this before, but I couldn't very well do so, on such
LINE 27: short notice, in Miller's presence--we are a conservative people, and
LINE 28: our local customs are not very flexible. We jog along in much the same
LINE 29: old way our fathers did. I'm not at all sure that Major Carteret or the
LINE 30: other gentlemen would consent to the presence of a negro doctor."
LINE 31: "I think you misjudge your own people," returned Dr. Burns, "they are
LINE 32: broader than you think. We have our prejudices against the negro at the
LINE 33: North, but we do not let them stand in the way of anything that _we_
LINE 34: want. At any rate, it is too late now, and I will accept the
LINE 35: responsibility. If the question is raised, I will attend to it. When I
LINE 36: am performing an operation I must be _aut Caesar, aut nullus_."
LINE 37: Dr. Price was not reassured, but he had done his duty and felt the
LINE 38: reward of virtue. If there should be trouble, he would not be
LINE 39: responsible. Moreover, there was a large fee at stake, and Dr. Burns was
LINE 40: not likely to prove too obdurate.
LINE 41: They were soon at Carteret's, where they found assembled the several
LINE 42: physicians invited by Dr. Price. These were successively introduced as
LINE 43: Drs. Dudley, Hooper, and Ashe, all of whom were gentlemen of good
LINE 44: standing, socially and in their profession, and considered it a high
LINE 45: privilege to witness so delicate an operation at the hands of so eminent
LINE 46: a member of their profession.
LINE 47: Major Carteret entered the room and was duly presented to the famous
LINE 48: specialist. Carteret's anxious look lightened somewhat at sight of the
LINE 49: array of talent present. It suggested, of course, the gravity of the
LINE 50: impending event, but gave assurance of all the skill and care which
LINE 51: science could afford.
LINE 52: Dr. Burns was shown to the nursery, from which he returned in five
LINE 53: minutes.
LINE 54: "The case is ready," he announced. "Are the gentlemen all present?"
LINE 55: "I believe so," answered Dr. Price quickly.
LINE 56: Miller had not yet arrived. Perhaps, thought Dr. Price, a happy
LINE 57: accident, or some imperative call, had detained him. This would be
LINE 58: fortunate indeed. Dr. Burns's square jaw had a very determined look. It
LINE 59: would be a pity if any acrimonious discussion should arise on the eve of
LINE 60: a delicate operation. If the clock on the mantel would only move faster,
LINE 61: the question might never come up.
LINE 62: "I don't see Dr. Miller," observed Dr. Burns, looking around the room.
LINE 63: "I asked him to come at eight. There are ten minutes yet."
LINE 64: Major Carteret looked up with a sudden frown.
LINE 65: "May I ask to whom you refer?" he inquired, in an ominous tone.
LINE 66: The other gentlemen showed signs of interest, not to say emotion. Dr.
LINE 67: Price smiled quizzically.
LINE 68: "Dr. Miller, of your city. He was one of my favorite pupils. He is also
LINE 69: a graduate of the Vienna hospitals, and a surgeon of unusual skill. I
LINE 70: have asked him to assist in the operation."
LINE 71: Every eye was turned toward Carteret, whose crimsoned face had set in a
LINE 72: look of grim determination.
LINE 73: "The person to whom you refer is a negro, I believe?" he said.
LINE 74: "He is a colored man, certainly," returned Dr. Burns, "though one would
LINE 75: never think of his color after knowing him well."
LINE 76: "I do not know, sir," returned Carteret, with an effort at self-control,
LINE 77: "what the customs of Philadelphia or Vienna may be; but in the South we
LINE 78: do not call negro doctors to attend white patients. I could not permit a
LINE 79: negro to enter my house upon such an errand."
LINE 80: "I am here, sir," replied Dr. Burns with spirit, "to perform a certain
LINE 81: operation. Since I assume the responsibility, the case must be under my
LINE 82: entire control. Otherwise I cannot operate."
LINE 83: "Gentlemen," interposed Dr. Price, smoothly, "I beg of you both--this is
LINE 84: a matter for calm discussion, and any asperity is to be deplored. The
LINE 85: life at stake here should not be imperiled by any consideration of minor
LINE 86: importance."
LINE 87: "Your humanity does you credit, sir," retorted Dr. Burns. "But other
LINE 88: matters, too, are important. I have invited this gentleman here. My
LINE 89: professional honor is involved, and I merely invoke my rights to
LINE 90: maintain it. It is a matter of principle, which ought not to give way to
LINE 91: a mere prejudice."
LINE 92: "That also states the case for Major Carteret," rejoined Dr. Price,
LINE 93: suavely. "He has certain principles,--call them prejudices, if you
LINE 94: like,--certain inflexible rules of conduct by which he regulates his
LINE 95: life. One of these, which he shares with us all in some degree, forbids
LINE 96: the recognition of the negro as a social equal."
LINE 97: "I do not know what Miller's social value may be," replied Dr. Burns,
LINE 98: stoutly, "or whether you gain or lose by your attitude toward him. I
LINE 99: have invited him here in a strictly professional capacity, with which
LINE 100: his color is not at all concerned."
LINE 101: "Dr. Burns does not quite appreciate Major Carteret's point of view,"
LINE 102: said Dr. Price. "This is not with him an unimportant matter, or a mere
LINE 103: question of prejudice, or even of personal taste. It is a sacred
LINE 104: principle, lying at the very root of our social order, involving the
LINE 105: purity and prestige of our race. You Northern gentlemen do not quite
LINE 106: appreciate our situation; if you lived here a year or two you would act
LINE 107: as we do. Of course," he added, diplomatically, "if there were no
LINE 108: alternative--if Dr. Burns were willing to put Dr. Miller's presence on
LINE 109: the ground of imperative necessity"--
LINE 110: "I do nothing of the kind, sir," retorted Dr. Burns with some heat. "I
LINE 111: have not come all the way from Philadelphia to undertake an operation
LINE 112: which I cannot perform without the aid of some particular physician. I
LINE 113: merely stand upon my professional rights."
LINE 114: Carteret was deeply agitated. The operation must not be deferred; his
LINE 115: child's life might be endangered by delay. If the negro's presence were
LINE 116: indispensable he would even submit to it, though in order to avoid so
LINE 117: painful a necessity, he would rather humble himself to the Northern
LINE 118: doctor. The latter course involved merely a personal sacrifice--the
LINE 119: former a vital principle. Perhaps there was another way of escape.
LINE 120: Miller's presence could not but be distasteful to Mrs. Carteret for
LINE 121: other reasons. Miller's wife was the living evidence of a painful
LINE 122: episode in Mrs. Carteret's family, which the doctor's presence would
LINE 123: inevitably recall. Once before, Mrs. Carteret's life had been endangered
LINE 124: by encountering, at a time of great nervous strain, this ill-born
LINE 125: sister and her child. She was even now upon the verge of collapse at the
LINE 126: prospect of her child's suffering, and should be protected from the
LINE 127: intrusion of any idea which might add to her distress.
LINE 128: "Dr. Burns," he said, with the suave courtesy which was part of his
LINE 129: inheritance, "I beg your pardon for my heat, and throw myself upon your
LINE 130: magnanimity, as between white men"--
LINE 131: "I am a gentleman, sir, before I am a white man," interposed Dr. Burns,
LINE 132: slightly mollified, however, by Carteret's change of manner.
LINE 133: "The terms should be synonymous," Carteret could not refrain from
LINE 134: saying. "As between white men, and gentlemen, I say to you, frankly,
LINE 135: that there are vital, personal reasons, apart from Dr. Miller's color,
LINE 136: why his presence in this house would be distasteful. With this
LINE 137: statement, sir, I throw myself upon your mercy. My child's life is worth
LINE 138: more to me than any earthly thing, and I must be governed by your
LINE 139: decision."
LINE 140: Dr. Burns was plainly wavering. The clock moved with provoking slowness.
LINE 141: Miller would be there in five minutes.
LINE 142: "May I speak with you privately a moment, doctor?" asked Dr. Price.
LINE 143: They withdrew from the room and were engaged in conversation for a few
LINE 144: moments. Dr. Burns finally yielded.
LINE 145: "I shall nevertheless feel humiliated when I meet Miller again," he
LINE 146: said, "but of course if there is a personal question involved, that
LINE 147: alters the situation. Had it been merely a matter of color, I should
LINE 148: have maintained my position. As things stand, I wash my hands of the
LINE 149: whole affair, so far as Miller is concerned, like Pontius Pilate--yes,
LINE 150: indeed, sir, I feel very much like that individual."
LINE 151: "I'll explain the matter to Miller," returned Dr. Price, amiably, "and
LINE 152: make it all right with him. We Southern people understand the negroes
LINE 153: better than you do, sir. Why should we not? They have been constantly
LINE 154: under our interested observation for several hundred years. You feel
LINE 155: this vastly more than Miller will. He knows the feeling of the white
LINE 156: people, and is accustomed to it. He wishes to live and do business here,
LINE 157: and is quite too shrewd to antagonize his neighbors or come where he is
LINE 158: not wanted. He is in fact too much of a gentleman to do so."
LINE 159: "I shall leave the explanation to you entirely," rejoined Dr. Burns, as
LINE 160: they reëntered the other room.
LINE 161: Carteret led the way to the nursery, where the operation was to take
LINE 162: place. Dr. Price lingered for a moment. Miller was not likely to be
LINE 163: behind the hour, if he came at all, and it would be well to head him off
LINE 164: before the operation began.
LINE 165: Scarcely had the rest left the room when the doorbell sounded, and a
LINE 166: servant announced Dr. Miller.
LINE 167: Dr. Price stepped into the hall and met Miller face to face.
LINE 168: He had meant to state the situation to Miller frankly, but now that the
LINE 169: moment had come he wavered. He was a fine physician, but he shrank from
LINE 170: strenuous responsibilities. It had been easy to theorize about the
LINE 171: negro; it was more difficult to look this man in the eyes--whom at this
LINE 172: moment he felt to be as essentially a gentleman as himself--and tell him
LINE 173: the humiliating truth.
LINE 174: As a physician his method was to ease pain--he would rather take the
LINE 175: risk of losing a patient from the use of an anaesthetic than from the
LINE 176: shock of an operation. He liked Miller, wished him well, and would not
LINE 177: wittingly wound his feelings. He really thought him too much of a
LINE 178: gentleman for the town, in view of the restrictions with which he must
LINE 179: inevitably be hampered. There was something melancholy, to a cultivated
LINE 180: mind, about a sensitive, educated man who happened to be off color. Such
LINE 181: a person was a sort of social misfit, an odd quantity, educated out of
LINE 182: his own class, with no possible hope of entrance into that above it. He
LINE 183: felt quite sure that if he had been in Miller's place, he would never
LINE 184: have settled in the South--he would have moved to Europe, or to the West
LINE 185: Indies, or some Central or South American state where questions of color
LINE 186: were not regarded as vitally important.
LINE 187: Dr. Price did not like to lie, even to a negro. To a man of his own
LINE 188: caste, his word was his bond. If it were painful to lie, it would be
LINE 189: humiliating to be found out. The principle of _noblesse oblige_ was also
LINE 190: involved in the matter. His claim of superiority to the colored doctor
LINE 191: rested fundamentally upon the fact that he was white and Miller was not;
LINE 192: and yet this superiority, for which he could claim no credit, since he
LINE 193: had not made himself, was the very breath of his nostrils,--he would not
LINE 194: have changed places with the other for wealth untold; and as a
LINE 195: gentleman, he would not care to have another gentleman, even a colored
LINE 196: man, catch him in a lie. Of this, however, there was scarcely any
LINE 197: danger. A word to the other surgeons would insure their corroboration of
LINE 198: whatever he might tell Miller. No one of them would willingly wound Dr.
LINE 199: Miller or embarrass Dr. Price; indeed, they need not know that Miller
LINE 200: had come in time for the operation.
LINE 201: "I'm sorry, Miller," he said with apparent regret, "but we were here
LINE 202: ahead of time, and the case took a turn which would admit of no delay,
LINE 203: so the gentlemen went in. Dr. Burns is with the patient now, and asked
LINE 204: me to explain why we did not wait for you."
LINE 205: "I'm sorry too," returned Miller, regretfully, but nothing doubting. He
LINE 206: was well aware that in such cases danger might attend upon delay. He had
LINE 207: lost his chance, through no fault of his own or of any one else.
LINE 208: "I hope that all is well?" he said, hesitatingly, not sure whether he
LINE 209: would be asked to remain.
LINE 210: "All is well, so far. Step round to my office in the morning, Miller, or
LINE 211: come in when you're passing, and I'll tell you the details."
LINE 212: This was tantamount to a dismissal, so Miller took his leave. Descending
LINE 213: the doorsteps, he stood for a moment, undecided whether to return home
LINE 214: or to go to the hotel and await the return of Dr. Burns, when he heard
LINE 215: his name called from the house in a low tone.
LINE 216: "Oh, doctuh!"
LINE 217: He stepped back toward the door, outside of which stood the colored
LINE 218: servant who had just let him out.
LINE 219: "Dat's all a lie, doctuh," he whispered, "'bout de operation bein'
LINE 220: already pe'fo'med. Dey-all had jes' gone in de minute befo' you
LINE 221: come--Doctuh Price hadn' even got out 'n de room. Dey be'n quollin'
LINE 222: 'bout you fer de las' ha'f hour. Majah Ca'te'et say he wouldn' have
LINE 223: you, an' de No'then doctuh say he wouldn't do nothin' widout you, an'
LINE 224: Doctuh Price he j'ined in on bofe sides, an' dey had it hot an' heavy,
LINE 225: nip an' tuck, till bimeby Majah Ca'te'et up an' say it wa'n't altogether
LINE 226: yo' color he objected to, an' wid dat de No'then doctuh give in. He's
LINE 227: a fine man, suh, but dey wuz too much fer 'im!"
LINE 228: "Thank you, Sam, I'm much obliged," returned Miller mechanically. "One
LINE 229: likes to know the truth."
LINE 230: Truth, it has been said, is mighty, and must prevail; but it sometimes
LINE 231: leaves a bad taste in the mouth. In the ordinary course of events Miller
LINE 232: would not have anticipated such an invitation, and for that reason had
LINE 233: appreciated it all the more. The rebuff came with a corresponding shock.
LINE 234: He had the heart of a man, the sensibilities of a cultivated gentleman;
LINE 235: the one was sore, the other deeply wounded. He was not altogether sure,
LINE 236: upon reflection, whether he blamed Dr. Price very much for the amiable
LINE 237: lie, which had been meant to spare his feelings, or thanked Sam a great
LINE 238: deal for the unpalatable truth.
LINE 239: Janet met him at the door. "How is the baby?" she asked excitedly.
LINE 240: "Dr. Price says he is doing well."
LINE 241: "What is the matter, Will, and why are you back so soon?"
LINE 242: He would have spared her the story, but she was a woman, and would have
LINE 243: it. He was wounded, too, and wanted sympathy, of which Janet was an
LINE 244: exhaustless fountain. So he told her what had happened. She comforted
LINE 245: him after the manner of a loving woman, and felt righteously indignant
LINE 246: toward her sister's husband, who had thus been instrumental in the
LINE 247: humiliation of her own. Her anger did not embrace her sister, and yet
LINE 248: she felt obscurely that their unacknowledged relationship had been the
LINE 249: malignant force which had given her husband pain, and defeated his
LINE 250: honorable ambition. When Dr. Price entered the nursery, Dr. Burns was
LINE 251: leaning attentively over the operating table. The implements needed for
LINE 252: the operation were all in readiness--the knives, the basin, the sponge,
LINE 253: the materials for dressing the wound--all the ghastly paraphernalia of
LINE 254: vivisection.
LINE 255: Mrs. Carteret had been banished to another room, where Clara vainly
LINE 256: attempted to soothe her. Old Mammy Jane, still burdened by her fears,
LINE 257: fervently prayed the good Lord to spare the life of the sweet little
LINE 258: grandson of her dear old mistress.
LINE 259: Dr. Burns had placed his ear to the child's chest, which had been bared
LINE 260: for the incision. Dr. Price stood ready to administer the anaesthetic.
LINE 261: Little Dodie looked up with a faint expression of wonder, as if dimly
LINE 262: conscious of some unusual event. The major shivered at the thought of
LINE 263: what the child must undergo.
LINE 264: "There's a change in his breathing," said Dr. Burns, lifting his head.
LINE 265: "The whistling noise is less pronounced, and he breathes easier. The
LINE 266: obstruction seems to have shifted."
LINE 267: Applying his ear again to the child's throat, he listened for a moment
LINE 268: intently, and then picking the baby up from the table, gave it a couple
LINE 269: of sharp claps between the shoulders. Simultaneously a small object shot
LINE 270: out from the child's mouth, struck Dr. Price in the neighborhood of his
LINE 271: waistband, and then rattled lightly against the floor. Whereupon the
LINE 272: baby, as though conscious of his narrow escape, smiled and gurgled, and
LINE 273: reaching upward clutched the doctor's whiskers with his little hand,
LINE 274: which, according to old Jane, had a stronger grip than any other
LINE 275: infant's in Wellington.
