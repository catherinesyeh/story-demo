LINE 1: To go back a little, for several days after his child's birth Major
LINE 2: Carteret's chief interest in life had been confined to the four walls of
LINE 3: the chamber where his pale wife lay upon her bed of pain, and those of
LINE 4: the adjoining room where an old black woman crooned lovingly over a
LINE 5: little white infant. A new element had been added to the major's
LINE 6: consciousness, broadening the scope and deepening the strength of his
LINE 7: affections. He did not love Olivia the less, for maternity had crowned
LINE 8: her wifehood with an added glory; but side by side with this old and
LINE 9: tried attachment was a new passion, stirring up dormant hopes and
LINE 10: kindling new desires. His regret had been more than personal at the
LINE 11: thought that with himself an old name should be lost to the State; and
LINE 12: now all the old pride of race, class, and family welled up anew, and
LINE 13: swelled and quickened the current of his life.
LINE 14: Upon the major's first appearance at the office, which took place the
LINE 15: second day after the child's birth, he opened a box of cigars in honor
LINE 16: of the event. The word had been passed around by Ellis, and the whole
LINE 17: office force, including reporters, compositors, and pressmen, came in to
LINE 18: congratulate the major and smoke at his expense. Even Jerry, the colored
LINE 19: porter,--Mammy Jane's grandson and therefore a protégé of the
LINE 20: family,--presented himself among the rest, or rather, after the rest.
LINE 21: The major shook hands with them all except Jerry, though he acknowledged
LINE 22: the porter's congratulations with a kind nod and put a good cigar into
LINE 23: his outstretched palm, for which Jerry thanked him without manifesting
LINE 24: any consciousness of the omission. He was quite aware that under
LINE 25: ordinary circumstances the major would not have shaken hands with white
LINE 26: workingmen, to say nothing of negroes; and he had merely hoped that in
LINE 27: the pleasurable distraction of the moment the major might also overlook
LINE 28: the distinction of color. Jerry's hope had been shattered, though not
LINE 29: rudely; for the major had spoken pleasantly and the cigar was a good
LINE 30: one. Mr. Ellis had once shaken hands with Jerry,--but Mr. Ellis was a
LINE 31: young man, whose Quaker father had never owned any slaves, and he could
LINE 32: not be expected to have as much pride as one of the best "quality,"
LINE 33: whose families had possessed land and negroes for time out of mind. On
LINE 34: the whole, Jerry preferred the careless nod of the editor-in-chief to
LINE 35: the more familiar greeting of the subaltern.
LINE 36: Having finished this pleasant ceremony, which left him with a
LINE 37: comfortable sense of his new dignity, the major turned to his desk. It
LINE 38: had been much neglected during the week, and more than one matter
LINE 39: claimed his attention; but as typical of the new trend of his thoughts,
LINE 40: the first subject he took up was one bearing upon the future of his son.
LINE 41: Quite obviously the career of a Carteret must not be left to chance,--it
LINE 42: must be planned and worked out with a due sense of the value of good
LINE 43: blood.
LINE 44: There lay upon his desk a letter from a well-known promoter, offering
LINE 45: the major an investment which promised large returns, though several
LINE 46: years must elapse before the enterprise could be put upon a paying
LINE 47: basis. The element of time, however, was not immediately important. The
LINE 48: Morning Chronicle provided him an ample income. The money available for
LINE 49: this investment was part of his wife's patrimony. It was invested in a
LINE 50: local cotton mill, which was paying ten per cent., but this was a
LINE 51: beggarly return compared with the immense profits promised by the
LINE 52: offered investment,--profits which would enable his son, upon reaching
LINE 53: manhood, to take a place in the world commensurate with the dignity of
LINE 54: his ancestors, one of whom, only a few generations removed, had owned an
LINE 55: estate of ninety thousand acres of land and six thousand slaves.
LINE 56: This letter having been disposed of by an answer accepting the offer,
LINE 57: the major took up his pen to write an editorial. Public affairs in the
LINE 58: state were not going to his satisfaction. At the last state election his
LINE 59: own party, after an almost unbroken rule of twenty years, had been
LINE 60: defeated by the so-called "Fusion" ticket, a combination of Republicans
LINE 61: and Populists. A clean sweep had been made of the offices in the state,
LINE 62: which were now filled by new men. Many of the smaller places had gone to
LINE 63: colored men, their people having voted almost solidly for the Fusion
LINE 64: ticket. In spite of the fact that the population of Wellington was two
LINE 65: thirds colored, this state of things was gall and wormwood to the
LINE 66: defeated party, of which the Morning Chronicle was the acknowledged
LINE 67: organ. Major Carteret shared this feeling. Only this very morning, while
LINE 68: passing the city hall, on his way to the office, he had seen the steps
LINE 69: of that noble building disfigured by a fringe of job-hunting negroes,
LINE 70: for all the world--to use a local simile--like a string of buzzards
LINE 71: sitting on a rail, awaiting their opportunity to batten upon the
LINE 72: helpless corpse of a moribund city.
LINE 73: Taking for his theme the unfitness of the negro to participate in
LINE 74: government,--an unfitness due to his limited education, his lack of
LINE 75: experience, his criminal tendencies, and more especially to his hopeless
LINE 76: mental and physical inferiority to the white race,--the major had
LINE 77: demonstrated, it seemed to him clearly enough, that the ballot in the
LINE 78: hands of the negro was a menace to the commonwealth. He had argued, with
LINE 79: entire conviction, that the white and black races could never attain
LINE 80: social and political harmony by commingling their blood; he had proved
LINE 81: by several historical parallels that no two unassimilable races could
LINE 82: ever live together except in the relation of superior and inferior; and
LINE 83: he was just dipping his gold pen into the ink to indite his conclusions
LINE 84: from the premises thus established, when Jerry, the porter, announced
LINE 85: two visitors.
LINE 86: "Gin'l Belmont an' Cap'n McBane would like ter see you, suh."
LINE 87: "Show them in, Jerry."
LINE 88: The man who entered first upon this invitation was a dapper little
LINE 89: gentleman with light-blue eyes and a Vandyke beard. He wore a frock
LINE 90: coat, patent leather shoes, and a Panama hat. There were crow's-feet
LINE 91: about his eyes, which twinkled with a hard and, at times, humorous
LINE 92: shrewdness. He had sloping shoulders, small hands and feet, and walked
LINE 93: with the leisurely step characteristic of those who have been reared
LINE 94: under hot suns.
LINE 95: Carteret gave his hand cordially to the gentleman thus described.
LINE 96: "How do you do, Captain McBane," he said, turning to the second visitor.
LINE 97: The individual thus addressed was strikingly different in appearance
LINE 98: from his companion. His broad shoulders, burly form, square jaw, and
LINE 99: heavy chin betokened strength, energy, and unscrupulousness. With the
LINE 100: exception of a small, bristling mustache, his face was clean shaven,
LINE 101: with here and there a speck of dried blood due to a carelessly or
LINE 102: unskillfully handled razor. A single deep-set gray eye was shadowed by a
LINE 103: beetling brow, over which a crop of coarse black hair, slightly streaked
LINE 104: with gray, fell almost low enough to mingle with his black, bushy
LINE 105: eyebrows. His coat had not been brushed for several days, if one might
LINE 106: judge from the accumulation of dandruff upon the collar, and his
LINE 107: shirt-front, in the middle of which blazed a showy diamond, was
LINE 108: plentifully stained with tobacco juice. He wore a large slouch hat,
LINE 109: which, upon entering the office, he removed and held in his hand.
LINE 110: Having greeted this person with an unconscious but quite perceptible
LINE 111: diminution of the warmth with which he had welcomed the other, the major
LINE 112: looked around the room for seats for his visitors, and perceiving only
LINE 113: one chair, piled with exchanges, and a broken stool propped against the
LINE 114: wall, pushed a button, which rang a bell in the hall, summoning the
LINE 115: colored porter to his presence.
LINE 116: "Jerry," said the editor when his servant appeared, "bring a couple of
LINE 117: chairs for these gentlemen."
LINE 118: While they stood waiting, the visitors congratulated the major on the
LINE 119: birth of his child, which had been announced in the Morning Chronicle,
LINE 120: and which the prominence of the family made in some degree a matter of
LINE 121: public interest.
LINE 122: "And now that you have a son, major," remarked the gentleman first
LINE 123: described, as he lit one of the major's cigars, "you'll be all the more
LINE 124: interested in doing something to make this town fit to live in, which is
LINE 125: what we came up to talk about. Things are in an awful condition! A negro
LINE 126: justice of the peace has opened an office on Market Street, and only
LINE 127: yesterday summoned a white man to appear before him. Negro lawyers get
LINE 128: most of the business in the criminal court. Last evening a group of
LINE 129: young white ladies, going quietly along the street arm-in-arm, were
LINE 130: forced off the sidewalk by a crowd of negro girls. Coming down the
LINE 131: street just now, I saw a spectacle of social equality and negro
LINE 132: domination that made my blood boil with indignation,--a white and a
LINE 133: black convict, chained together, crossing the city in charge of a negro
LINE 134: officer! We cannot stand that sort of thing, Carteret,--it is the last
LINE 135: straw! Something must be done, and that quickly!"
LINE 136: The major thrilled with responsive emotion. There was something
LINE 137: prophetic in this opportune visit. The matter was not only in his own
LINE 138: thoughts, but in the air; it was the spontaneous revulsion of white men
LINE 139: against the rule of an inferior race. These were the very men, above all
LINE 140: others in the town, to join him in a movement to change these degrading
LINE 141: conditions.
LINE 142: General Belmont, the smaller of the two, was a man of good family, a
LINE 143: lawyer by profession, and took an active part in state and local
LINE 144: politics. Aristocratic by birth and instinct, and a former owner of
LINE 145: slaves, his conception of the obligations and rights of his caste was
LINE 146: nevertheless somewhat lower than that of the narrower but more sincere
LINE 147: Carteret. In serious affairs Carteret desired the approval of his
LINE 148: conscience, even if he had to trick that docile organ into
LINE 149: acquiescence. This was not difficult to do in politics, for he believed
LINE 150: in the divine right of white men and gentlemen, as his ancestors had
LINE 151: believed in and died for the divine right of kings. General Belmont was
LINE 152: not without a gentleman's distaste for meanness, but he permitted no
LINE 153: fine scruples to stand in the way of success. He had once been minister,
LINE 154: under a Democratic administration, to a small Central American state.
LINE 155: Political rivals had characterized him as a tricky demagogue, which may
LINE 156: of course have been a libel. He had an amiable disposition, possessed
LINE 157: the gift of eloquence, and was a prime social favorite.
LINE 158: Captain George McBane had sprung from the poor-white class, to which,
LINE 159: even more than to the slaves, the abolition of slavery had opened the
LINE 160: door of opportunity. No longer overshadowed by a slaveholding caste,
LINE 161: some of this class had rapidly pushed themselves forward. Some had made
LINE 162: honorable records. Others, foremost in negro-baiting and election
LINE 163: frauds, had done the dirty work of politics, as their fathers had done
LINE 164: that of slavery, seeking their reward at first in minor offices,--for
LINE 165: which men of gentler breeding did not care,--until their ambition began
LINE 166: to reach out for higher honors.
LINE 167: Of this class McBane--whose captaincy, by the way, was merely a polite
LINE 168: fiction--had been one of the most successful. He had held, until
LINE 169: recently, as the reward of questionable political services, a contract
LINE 170: with the State for its convict labor, from which in a few years he had
LINE 171: realized a fortune. But the methods which made his contract profitable
LINE 172: had not commended themselves to humane people, and charges of cruelty
LINE 173: and worse had been preferred against him. He was rich enough to escape
LINE 174: serious consequences from the investigation which followed, but when the
LINE 175: Fusion ticket carried the state he lost his contract, and the system of
LINE 176: convict labor was abolished. Since then McBane had devoted himself to
LINE 177: politics: he was ambitious for greater wealth, for office, and for
LINE 178: social recognition. A man of few words and self-engrossed, he seldom
LINE 179: spoke of his aspirations except where speech might favor them,
LINE 180: preferring to seek his ends by secret "deals" and combinations rather
LINE 181: than to challenge criticism and provoke rivalry by more open methods.
LINE 182: At sight, therefore, of these two men, with whose careers and characters
LINE 183: he was entirely familiar, Carteret felt sweep over his mind the
LINE 184: conviction that now was the time and these the instruments with which to
LINE 185: undertake the redemption of the state from the evil fate which had
LINE 186: befallen it.
LINE 187: Jerry, the porter, who had gone downstairs to the counting-room to find
LINE 188: two whole chairs, now entered with one in each hand. He set a chair for
LINE 189: the general, who gave him an amiable nod, to which Jerry responded with
LINE 190: a bow and a scrape. Captain McBane made no acknowledgment, but fixed
LINE 191: Jerry so fiercely with his single eye that upon placing the chair Jerry
LINE 192: made his escape from the room as rapidly as possible.
LINE 193: "I don' like dat Cap'n McBane," he muttered, upon reaching the hall.
LINE 194: "Dey says he got dat eye knock' out tryin' ter whip a cullud 'oman, when
LINE 195: he wuz a boy, an' dat he ain' never had no use fer niggers
LINE 196: sence,--'cep'n' fer what he could make outen 'em wid his convic' labor
LINE 197: contrac's. His daddy wuz a' overseer befo' 'im, an' it come nachul fer
LINE 198: him ter be a nigger-driver. I don' want dat one eye er his'n restin' on
LINE 199: me no longer 'n I kin he'p, an' I don' know how I'm gwine ter like dis
LINE 200: job ef he's gwine ter be comin' roun' here. He ain' nothin' but po'
LINE 201: w'ite trash nohow; but Lawd! Lawd! look at de money he's got,--livin'
LINE 202: at de hotel, wearin' di'mon's, an' colloguin' wid de bes' quality er dis
LINE 203: town! 'Pears ter me de bottom rail is gittin' mighty close ter de top.
LINE 204: Well, I s'pose it all comes f'm bein' w'ite. I wush ter Gawd I wuz
LINE 205: w'ite!"
LINE 206: After this fervent aspiration, having nothing else to do for the time
LINE 207: being, except to remain within call, and having caught a few words of
LINE 208: the conversation as he went in with the chairs, Jerry, who possessed a
LINE 209: certain amount of curiosity, placed close to the wall the broken stool
LINE 210: upon which he sat while waiting in the hall, and applied his ear to a
LINE 211: hole in the plastering of the hallway. There was a similar defect in the
LINE 212: inner wall, between the same two pieces of studding, and while this
LINE 213: inner opening was not exactly opposite the outer, Jerry was enabled,
LINE 214: through the two, to catch in a more or less fragmentary way what was
LINE 215: going on within.
LINE 216: He could hear the major, now and then, use the word "negro," and
LINE 217: McBane's deep voice was quite audible when he referred, it seemed to
LINE 218: Jerry with alarming frequency, to "the damned niggers," while the
LINE 219: general's suave tones now and then pronounced the word "niggro,"--a sort
LINE 220: of compromise between ethnology and the vernacular. That the gentlemen
LINE 221: were talking politics seemed quite likely, for gentlemen generally
LINE 222: talked politics when they met at the Chronicle office. Jerry could hear
LINE 223: the words "vote," "franchise," "eliminate," "constitution," and other
LINE 224: expressions which marked the general tenor of the talk, though he could
LINE 225: not follow it all,--partly because he could not hear everything
LINE 226: distinctly, and partly because of certain limitations which nature had
LINE 227: placed in the way of Jerry's understanding anything very difficult or
LINE 228: abstruse.
LINE 229: He had gathered enough, however, to realize, in a vague way, that
LINE 230: something serious was on foot, involving his own race, when a bell
LINE 231: sounded over his head, at which he sprang up hastily and entered the
LINE 232: room where the gentlemen were talking.
LINE 233: "Jerry," said the major, "wait on Captain McBane."
LINE 234: "Yas, suh," responded Jerry, turning toward the captain, whose eye he
LINE 235: carefully avoided meeting directly.
LINE 236: "Take that half a dollar, boy," ordered McBane, "an' go 'cross the
LINE 237: street to Mr. Sykes's, and tell him to send me three whiskies. Bring
LINE 238: back the change, and make has'e."
LINE 239: The captain tossed the half dollar at Jerry, who, looking to one side,
LINE 240: of course missed it. He picked the money up, however, and backed out of
LINE 241: the room. Jerry did not like Captain McBane, to begin with, and it was
LINE 242: clear that the captain was no gentleman, or he would not have thrown the
LINE 243: money at him. Considering the source, Jerry might have overlooked this
LINE 244: discourtesy had it not been coupled with the remark about the change,
LINE 245: which seemed to him in very poor taste.
LINE 246: Returning in a few minutes with three glasses on a tray, he passed them
LINE 247: round, handed Captain McBane his change, and retired to the hall.
LINE 248: "Gentlemen," exclaimed the captain, lifting his glass, "I propose a
LINE 249: toast: 'No nigger domination.'"
LINE 250: "Amen!" said the others, and three glasses were solemnly drained.
LINE 251: "Major," observed the general, smacking his lips, "_I_ should like to
LINE 252: use Jerry for a moment, if you will permit me."
LINE 253: Jerry appeared promptly at the sound of the bell. He had remained
LINE 254: conveniently near,--calls of this sort were apt to come in sequence.
LINE 255: "Jerry," said the general, handing Jerry half a dollar, "go over to Mr.
LINE 256: Brown's,--I get my liquor there,--and tell them to send me three glasses
LINE 257: of my special mixture. And, Jerry,--you may keep the change!"
LINE 258: "Thank y', gin'l, thank y', marster," replied Jerry, with unctuous
LINE 259: gratitude, bending almost double as he backed out of the room.
LINE 260: "Dat's a gent'eman, a rale ole-time gent'eman," he said to himself when
LINE 261: he had closed the door. "But dere's somethin' gwine on in dere,--dere
LINE 262: sho' is! 'No nigger damnation!' Dat soun's all right,--I'm sho' dere
LINE 263: ain' no nigger I knows w'at wants damnation, do' dere's lots of 'em w'at
LINE 264: deserves it; but ef dat one-eyed Cap'n McBane got anything ter do wid
LINE 265: it, w'atever it is, it don' mean no good fer de niggers,--damnation'd
LINE 266: be better fer 'em dan dat Cap'n McBane! He looks at a nigger lack he
LINE 267: could jes' eat 'im alive."
LINE 268: "This mixture, gentlemen," observed the general when Jerry had returned
LINE 269: with the glasses, "was originally compounded by no less a person than
LINE 270: the great John C. Calhoun himself, who confided the recipe to my father
LINE 271: over the convivial board. In this nectar of the gods, gentlemen, I drink
LINE 272: with you to 'White Supremacy!'"
LINE 273: "White Supremacy everywhere!" added McBane with fervor.
LINE 274: "Now and forever!" concluded Carteret solemnly.
LINE 275: When the visitors, half an hour later, had taken their departure,
LINE 276: Carteret, inspired by the theme, and in less degree by the famous
LINE 277: mixture of the immortal Calhoun, turned to his desk and finished, at a
LINE 278: white heat, his famous editorial in which he sounded the tocsin of a new
LINE 279: crusade.
LINE 280: At noon, when the editor, having laid down his pen, was leaving the
LINE 281: office, he passed Jerry in the hall without a word or a nod. The major
LINE 282: wore a rapt look, which Jerry observed with a vague uneasiness.
LINE 283: "He looks jes' lack he wuz walkin' in his sleep," muttered Jerry
LINE 284: uneasily. "Dere's somethin' up, sho 's you bawn! 'No nigger damnation!'
LINE 285: Anybody'd 'low dey wuz all gwine ter heaven; but I knows better! W'en a
LINE 286: passel er w'ite folks gits ter talkin' 'bout de niggers lack dem in
LINE 287: yander, it's mo' lackly dey're gwine ter ketch somethin' e'se dan
LINE 288: heaven! I got ter keep my eyes open an' keep up wid w'at's happenin'. Ef
LINE 289: dere's gwine ter be anudder flood 'roun' here, I wants ter git in de
LINE 290: ark wid de w'ite folks,--I may haf ter be anudder Ham, an' sta't de
LINE 291: cullud race all over ag'in."
