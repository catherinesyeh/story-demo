LINE 1: The party under Josh's leadership moved off down the road. Miller, while
LINE 2: entirely convinced that he had acted wisely in declining to accompany
LINE 3: them, was yet conscious of a distinct feeling of shame and envy that he,
LINE 4: too, did not feel impelled to throw away his life in a hopeless
LINE 5: struggle.
LINE 6: Watson left the buggy and disappeared by a path at the roadside. Miller
LINE 7: drove rapidly forward. After entering the town, he passed several small
LINE 8: parties of white men, but escaped scrutiny by sitting well back in his
LINE 9: buggy, the presumption being that a well-dressed man with a good horse
LINE 10: and buggy was white. Torn with anxiety, he reached home at about four
LINE 11: o'clock. Driving the horse into the yard, he sprang down from the buggy
LINE 12: and hastened to the house, which he found locked, front and rear.
LINE 13: A repeated rapping brought no response. At length he broke a window, and
LINE 14: entered the house like a thief.
LINE 15: "Janet, Janet!" he called in alarm, "where are you? It is only
LINE 16: I,--Will!"
LINE 17: There was no reply. He ran from room to room, only to find them all
LINE 18: empty. Again he called his wife's name, and was about rushing from the
LINE 19: house, when a muffled voice came faintly to his ear,--
LINE 20: "Is dat you, Doctuh Miller?"
LINE 21: "Yes. Who are you, and where are my wife and child?"
LINE 22: He was looking around in perplexity, when the door of a low closet under
LINE 23: the kitchen sink was opened from within, and a woolly head was
LINE 24: cautiously protruded.
LINE 25: "Are you _sho'_ dat's you, doctuh?"
LINE 26: "Yes, Sally; where are"--
LINE 27: "An' not some w'ite man come ter bu'n down de house an' kill all de
LINE 28: niggers?"
LINE 29: "No, Sally, it's me all right. Where is my wife? Where is my child?"
LINE 30: "Dey went over ter see Mis' Butler 'long 'bout two o'clock, befo' dis
LINE 31: fuss broke out, suh. Oh, Lawdy, Lawdy, suh! Is all de cullud folks be'n
LINE 32: killt 'cep'n' me an' you, suh? Fer de Lawd's sake, suh, you won' let 'em
LINE 33: kill me, will you, suh? I'll wuk fer you fer nuthin', suh, all my bawn
LINE 34: days, ef you'll save my life, suh!"
LINE 35: "Calm yourself, Sally. You'll be safe enough if you stay right here, I
LINE 36: 'we no doubt. They'll not harm women,--of that I'm sure enough,
LINE 37: although I haven't yet got the bearings of this deplorable affair. Stay
LINE 38: here and look after the house. I must find my wife and child!"
LINE 39: The distance across the city to the home of the Mrs. Butler whom his
LINE 40: wife had gone to visit was exactly one mile. Though Miller had a good
LINE 41: horse in front of him, he was two hours in reaching his destination.
LINE 42: Never will the picture of that ride fade from his memory. In his dreams
LINE 43: he repeats it night after night, and sees the sights that wounded his
LINE 44: eyes, and feels the thoughts--the haunting spirits of the thoughts--that
LINE 45: tore his heart as he rode through hell to find those whom he was
LINE 46: seeking. For a short distance he saw nothing, and made rapid progress.
LINE 47: As he turned the first corner, his horse shied at the dead body of a
LINE 48: negro, lying huddled up in the collapse which marks sudden death. What
LINE 49: Miller shuddered at was not so much the thought of death, to the sight
LINE 50: of which his profession had accustomed him, as the suggestion of what it
LINE 51: signified. He had taken with allowance the wild statement of the fleeing
LINE 52: fugitives. Watson, too, had been greatly excited, and Josh Green's group
LINE 53: were desperate men, as much liable to be misled by their courage as the
LINE 54: others by their fears; but here was proof that murder had been
LINE 55: done,--and his wife and children were in the town. Distant shouts, and
LINE 56: the sound of firearms, increased his alarm. He struck his horse with the
LINE 57: whip, and dashed on toward the heart of the city, which he must traverse
LINE 58: in order to reach Janet and the child.
LINE 59: At the next corner lay the body of another man, with the red blood
LINE 60: oozing from a ghastly wound in the forehead. The negroes seemed to have
LINE 61: been killed, as the band plays in circus parades, at the street
LINE 62: intersections, where the example would be most effective. Miller, with a
LINE 63: wild leap of the heart, had barely passed this gruesome spectacle, when
LINE 64: a sharp voice commanded him to halt, and emphasized the order by
LINE 65: covering him with a revolver. Forgetting the prudence he had preached to
LINE 66: others, he had raised his whip to strike the horse, when several hands
LINE 67: seized the bridle.
LINE 68: "Come down, you damn fool," growled an authoritative voice. "Don't you
LINE 69: see we're in earnest? Do you want to get killed?"
LINE 70: "Why should I come down?" asked Miller. "Because we've ordered you to
LINE 71: come down! This is the white people's day, and when they order, a nigger
LINE 72: must obey. We're going to search you for weapons."
LINE 73: "Search away. You'll find nothing but a case of surgeon's tools, which
LINE 74: I'm more than likely to need before this day is over, from all
LINE 75: indications."
LINE 76: "No matter; we'll make sure of it! That's what we're here for. Come
LINE 77: down, if you don't want to be pulled down!"
LINE 78: Miller stepped down from his buggy. His interlocutor, who made no effort
LINE 79: at disguise, was a clerk in a dry-goods store where Miller bought most
LINE 80: of his family and hospital supplies. He made no sign of recognition,
LINE 81: however, and Miller claimed no acquaintance. This man, who had for
LINE 82: several years emptied Miller's pockets in the course of more or less
LINE 83: legitimate trade, now went through them, aided by another man, more
LINE 84: rapidly than ever before, the searchers convincing themselves that
LINE 85: Miller carried no deadly weapon upon his person. Meanwhile, a third
LINE 86: ransacked the buggy with like result. Miller recognized several others
LINE 87: of the party, who made not the slightest attempt at disguise, though no
LINE 88: names were called by any one.
LINE 89: "Where are you going?" demanded the leader.
LINE 90: "I am looking for my wife and child," replied Miller.
LINE 91: "Well, run along, and keep them out of the streets when you find them;
LINE 92: and keep your hands out of this affair, if you wish to live in this
LINE 93: town, which from now on will be a white man's town, as you niggers will
LINE 94: be pretty firmly convinced before night."
LINE 95: Miller drove on as swiftly as might be. At the next corner he was
LINE 96: stopped again. In the white man who held him up, Miller recognized a
LINE 97: neighbor of his own. After a short detention and a perfunctory search,
LINE 98: the white man remarked apologetically:--
LINE 99: "Sorry to have had to trouble you, doctuh, but them's the o'ders. It
LINE 100: ain't men like you that we're after, but the vicious and criminal class
LINE 101: of niggers."
LINE 102: Miller smiled bitterly as he urged his horse forward. He was quite well
LINE 103: aware that the virtuous citizen who had stopped him had only a few weeks
LINE 104: before finished a term in the penitentiary, to which he had been
LINE 105: sentenced for stealing. Miller knew that he could have bought all the
LINE 106: man owned for fifty dollars, and his soul for as much more.
LINE 107: A few rods farther on, he came near running over the body of a wounded
LINE 108: man who lay groaning by the wayside. Every professional instinct urged
LINE 109: him to stop and offer aid to the sufferer; but the uncertainty
LINE 110: concerning his wife and child proved a stronger motive and urged him
LINE 111: resistlessly forward. Here and there the ominous sound of firearms was
LINE 112: audible. He might have thought this merely a part of the show, like the
LINE 113: "powder play" of the Arabs, but for the bloody confirmation of its
LINE 114: earnestness which had already assailed his vision. Somewhere in this
LINE 115: seething caldron of unrestrained passions were his wife and child, and
LINE 116: he must hurry on.
LINE 117: His progress was painfully slow. Three times he was stopped and
LINE 118: searched. More than once his way was barred, and he was ordered to turn
LINE 119: back, each such occasion requiring a detour which consumed many minutes.
LINE 120: The man who last stopped him was a well-known Jewish merchant. A
LINE 121: Jew--God of Moses!--had so far forgotten twenty centuries of history as
LINE 122: to join in the persecution of another oppressed race! When almost
LINE 123: reduced to despair by these innumerable delays, he perceived, coming
LINE 124: toward him, Mr. Ellis, the sub-editor of the Morning Chronicle. Miller
LINE 125: had just been stopped and questioned again, and Ellis came up as he was
LINE 126: starting once more upon his endless ride.
LINE 127: "Dr. Miller," said Ellis kindly, "it is dangerous for you on the
LINE 128: streets. Why tempt the danger?"
LINE 129: "I am looking for my wife and child," returned Miller in desperation.
LINE 130: "They are somewhere in this town,--I don't know where,--and I must find
LINE 131: them."
LINE 132: Ellis had been horror-stricken by the tragedy of the afternoon, the
LINE 133: wholly superfluous slaughter of a harmless people, whom a show of force
LINE 134: would have been quite sufficient to overawe. Elaborate explanations were
LINE 135: afterwards given for these murders, which were said, perhaps truthfully,
LINE 136: not to have been premeditated, and many regrets were expressed. The
LINE 137: young man had been surprised, quite as much as the negroes themselves,
LINE 138: at the ferocity displayed. His own thoughts and feelings were attuned to
LINE 139: anything but slaughter. Only that morning he had received a perfumed
LINE 140: note, calling his attention to what the writer described as a very noble
LINE 141: deed of his, and requesting him to call that evening and receive the
LINE 142: writer's thanks. Had he known that Miss Pemberton, several weeks after
LINE 143: their visit to the Sound, had driven out again to the hotel and made
LINE 144: some inquiries among the servants, he might have understood better the
LINE 145: meaning of this missive. When Miller spoke of his wife and child, some
LINE 146: subtle thread of suggestion coupled the note with Miller's plight.
LINE 147: "I'll go with you, Dr. Miller," he said, "if you'll permit me. In my
LINE 148: company you will not be disturbed."
LINE 149: He took a seat in Miller's buggy, after which it was not molested.
LINE 150: Neither of them spoke. Miller was sick at heart; he could have wept with
LINE 151: grief, even had the welfare of his own dear ones not been involved in
LINE 152: this regrettable affair. With prophetic instinct he foresaw the hatreds
LINE 153: to which this day would give birth; the long years of constraint and
LINE 154: distrust which would still further widen the breach between two peoples
LINE 155: whom fate had thrown together in one community.
LINE 156: There was nothing for Ellis to say. In his heart he could not defend the
LINE 157: deeds of this day. The petty annoyances which the whites had felt at the
LINE 158: spectacle of a few negroes in office; the not unnatural resentment of a
LINE 159: proud people at what had seemed to them a presumptuous freedom of speech
LINE 160: and lack of deference on the part of their inferiors,--these things,
LINE 161: which he knew were to be made the excuse for overturning the city
LINE 162: government, he realized full well were no sort of justification for the
LINE 163: wholesale murder or other horrors which might well ensue before the day
LINE 164: was done. He could not approve the acts of his own people; neither could
LINE 165: he, to a negro, condemn them. Hence he was silent.
LINE 166: "Thank you, Mr. Ellis," exclaimed Miller, when they had reached the
LINE 167: house where he expected to find his wife. "This is the place where I was
LINE 168: going. I am--under a great obligation to you."
LINE 169: "Not at all, Dr. Miller. I need not tell you how much I regret this
LINE 170: deplorable affair."
LINE 171: Ellis went back down the street. Fastening his horse to the fence,
LINE 172: Miller sprang forward to find his wife and child. They would certainly
LINE 173: be there, for no colored woman would be foolhardy enough to venture on
LINE 174: the streets after the riot had broken out.
LINE 175: As he drew nearer, he felt a sudden apprehension. The house seemed
LINE 176: strangely silent and deserted. The doors were closed, and the Venetian
LINE 177: blinds shut tightly. Even a dog which had appeared slunk timidly back
LINE 178: under the house, instead of barking vociferously according to the usual
LINE 179: habit of his kind.
