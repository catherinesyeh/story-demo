LINE 1: Late one afternoon a handsome trap, drawn by two spirited bays, drove up
LINE 2: to Carteret's gate. Three places were taken by Mrs. Carteret, Clara, and
LINE 3: the major, leaving the fourth seat vacant.
LINE 4: "I've asked Ellis to drive out with us," said the major, as he took the
LINE 5: lines from the colored man who had the trap in charge. "We'll go by the
LINE 6: office and pick him up."
LINE 7: Clara frowned, but perceiving Mrs. Carteret's eye fixed upon her,
LINE 8: restrained any further expression of annoyance.
LINE 9: The major's liking for Ellis had increased within the year. The young
LINE 10: man was not only a good journalist, but possessed sufficient cleverness
LINE 11: and tact to make him excellent company. The major was fond of argument,
LINE 12: but extremely tenacious of his own opinions. Ellis handled the foils of
LINE 13: discussion with just the requisite skill to draw out the major,
LINE 14: permitting himself to be vanquished, not too easily, but, as it were,
LINE 15: inevitably, by the major's incontrovertible arguments.
LINE 16: Olivia had long suspected Ellis of feeling a more than friendly interest
LINE 17: in Clara. Herself partial to Tom, she had more than once thought it
LINE 18: hardly fair to Delamere, or even to Clara, who was young and
LINE 19: impressionable, to have another young man constantly about the house.
LINE 20: True, there had seemed to be no great danger, for Ellis had neither the
LINE 21: family nor the means to make him a suitable match for the major's
LINE 22: sister; nor had Clara made any secret of her dislike for Ellis, or of
LINE 23: her resentment for his supposed depreciation of Delamere. Mrs. Carteret
LINE 24: was inclined to a more just and reasonable view of Ellis's conduct in
LINE 25: this matter, but nevertheless did not deem it wise to undeceive Clara.
LINE 26: Dislike was a stout barrier, which remorse might have broken down. The
LINE 27: major, absorbed in schemes of empire and dreams of his child's future,
LINE 28: had not become cognizant of the affair. His wife, out of friendship for
LINE 29: Tom, had refrained from mentioning it; while the major, with a delicate
LINE 30: regard for Clara's feelings, had said nothing at home in regard to his
LINE 31: interview with her lover.
LINE 32: At the Chronicle office Ellis took the front seat beside the major.
LINE 33: After leaving the city pavements, they bowled along merrily over an
LINE 34: excellent toll-road, built of oyster shells from the neighboring sound,
LINE 35: stopping at intervals to pay toll to the gate-keepers, most of whom were
LINE 36: white women with tallow complexions and snuff-stained lips,--the
LINE 37: traditional "poor-white." For part of the way the road was bordered with
LINE 38: a growth of scrub oak and pine, interspersed with stretches of cleared
LINE 39: land, white with the opening cotton or yellow with ripening corn. To the
LINE 40: right, along the distant river-bank, were visible here and there groups
LINE 41: of turpentine pines, though most of this growth had for some years been
LINE 42: exhausted. Twenty years before, Wellington had been the world's greatest
LINE 43: shipping port for naval stores. But as the turpentine industry had moved
LINE 44: southward, leaving a trail of devastated forests in its rear, the city
LINE 45: had fallen to a poor fifth or sixth place in this trade, relying now
LINE 46: almost entirely upon cotton for its export business.
LINE 47: Occasionally our party passed a person, or a group of persons,--mostly
LINE 48: negroes approximating the pure type, for those of lighter color grew
LINE 49: noticeably scarcer as the town was left behind. Now and then one of
LINE 50: these would salute the party respectfully, while others glanced at them
LINE 51: indifferently or turned away. There would have seemed, to a stranger, a
LINE 52: lack, of spontaneous friendliness between the people of these two races,
LINE 53: as though each felt that it had no part or lot in the other's life. At
LINE 54: one point the carriage drew near a party of colored folks who were
LINE 55: laughing and jesting among themselves with great glee. Paying no
LINE 56: attention to the white people, they continued to laugh and shout
LINE 57: boisterously as the carriage swept by.
LINE 58: Major Carteret's countenance wore an angry look.
LINE 59: "The negroes around this town are becoming absolutely insufferable," he
LINE 60: averred. "They are sadly in need of a lesson in manners."
LINE 61: Half an hour later they neared another group, who were also making
LINE 62: merry. As the carriage approached, they became mute and silent as the
LINE 63: grave until the major's party had passed.
LINE 64: "The negroes are a sullen race," remarked the major thoughtfully. "They
LINE 65: will learn their lesson in a rude school, and perhaps much sooner than
LINE 66: they dream. By the way," he added, turning to the ladies, "what was the
LINE 67: arrangement with Tom? Was he to come out this evening?"
LINE 68: "He came out early in the afternoon," replied Clara, "to go a-fishing.
LINE 69: He is to join us at the hotel."
LINE 70: After an hour's drive they reached the hotel, in front of which
LINE 71: stretched the beach, white and inviting, along the shallow sound. Mrs.
LINE 72: Carteret and Clara found seats on the veranda. Having turned the trap
LINE 73: over to a hostler, the major joined a group of gentlemen, among whom was
LINE 74: General Belmont, and was soon deep in the discussion of the standing
LINE 75: problem of how best to keep the negroes down.
LINE 76: Ellis remained by the ladies. Clara seemed restless and ill at ease.
LINE 77: Half an hour elapsed and Delamere had not appeared.
LINE 78: "I wonder where Tom is," said Mrs. Carteret.
LINE 79: "I guess he hasn't come in yet from fishing," said Clara. "I wish he
LINE 80: would come. It's lonesome here. Mr. Ellis, would you mind looking about
LINE 81: the hotel and seeing if there's any one here that we know?"
LINE 82: For Ellis the party was already one too large. He had accepted this
LINE 83: invitation eagerly, hoping to make friends with Clara during the
LINE 84: evening. He had never been able to learn definitely the reason of her
LINE 85: coldness, but had dated it from his meeting with old Mrs. Ochiltree,
LINE 86: with which he felt it was obscurely connected. He had noticed Delamere's
LINE 87: scowling look, too, at their last meeting. Clara's injustice, whatever
LINE 88: its cause, he felt keenly. To Delamere's scowl he had paid little
LINE 89: attention,--he despised Tom so much that, but for his engagement to
LINE 90: Clara, he would have held his opinions in utter contempt.
LINE 91: He had even wished that Clara might make some charge against him,--he
LINE 92: would have preferred that to her attitude of studied indifference, the
LINE 93: only redeeming feature about which was that it _was_ studied, showing
LINE 94: that she, at least, had him in mind. The next best thing, he reasoned,
LINE 95: to having a woman love you, is to have her dislike you violently,--the
LINE 96: main point is that you should be kept in mind, and made the subject of
LINE 97: strong emotions. He thought of the story of Hall Caine's, where the
LINE 98: woman, after years of persecution at the hands of an unwelcome suitor,
LINE 99: is on the point of yielding, out of sheer irresistible admiration for
LINE 100: the man's strength and persistency, when the lover, unaware of his
LINE 101: victory and despairing of success, seizes her in his arms and, springing
LINE 102: into the sea, finds a watery grave for both. The analogy of this case
LINE 103: with his own was, of course, not strong. He did not anticipate any
LINE 104: tragedy in their relations; but he was glad to be thought of upon almost
LINE 105: any terms. He would not have done a mean thing to make her think of him;
LINE 106: but if she did so because of a misconception, which he was given no
LINE 107: opportunity to clear up, while at the same time his conscience absolved
LINE 108: him from evil and gave him the compensating glow of martyrdom, it was at
LINE 109: least better than nothing.
LINE 110: He would, of course, have preferred to be upon a different footing. It
LINE 111: had been a pleasure to have her speak to him during the drive,--they had
LINE 112: exchanged a few trivial remarks in the general conversation. It was a
LINE 113: greater pleasure to have her ask a favor of him,--a pleasure which, in
LINE 114: this instance, was partly offset when he interpreted her request to mean
LINE 115: that he was to look for Tom Delamere. He accepted the situation
LINE 116: gracefully, however, and left the ladies alone.
LINE 117: Knowing Delamere's habits, he first went directly to the bar-room,--the
LINE 118: atmosphere would be congenial, even if he were not drinking. Delamere
LINE 119: was not there. Stepping next into the office, he asked the clerk if
LINE 120: young Mr. Delamere had been at the hotel.
LINE 121: "Yes, sir," returned the man at the desk, "he was here at luncheon, and
LINE 122: then went out fishing in a boat with several other gentlemen. I think
LINE 123: they came back about three o'clock. I'll find out for you."
LINE 124: He rang the bell, to which a colored boy responded.
LINE 125: "Front," said the clerk, "see if young Mr. Delamere's upstairs. Look in
LINE 126: 255 or 256, and let me know at once."
LINE 127: The bell-boy returned in a moment.
LINE 128: "Yas, suh," he reported, with a suppressed grin, "he's in 256, suh. De
LINE 129: do' was open, an' I seed 'im from de hall, suh."
LINE 130: "I wish you'd go up and tell him," said Ellis, "that--What are you
LINE 131: grinning about?" he asked suddenly, noticing the waiter's expression.
LINE 132: "Nothin', suh, nothin' at all, suh," responded the negro, lapsing into
LINE 133: the stolidity of a wooden Indian. "What shall I tell Mr. Delamere, suh?"
LINE 134: "Tell him," resumed Ellis, still watching the boy suspiciously,--"no, I'll
LINE 135: tell him myself."
LINE 136: He ascended the broad stair to the second floor. There was an upper
LINE 137: balcony and a parlor, with a piano for the musically inclined. To reach
LINE 138: these one had to pass along the hall upon which the room mentioned by
LINE 139: the bell-boy opened. Ellis was quite familiar with the hotel. He could
LINE 140: imagine circumstances under which he would not care to speak to
LINE 141: Delamere; he would merely pass through the hall and glance into the room
LINE 142: casually, as any one else might do, and see what the darky downstairs
LINE 143: might have meant by his impudence.
LINE 144: It required but a moment to reach the room. The door was not wide open,
LINE 145: but far enough ajar for him to see what was going on within.
LINE 146: Two young men, members of the fast set at the Clarendon Club, were
LINE 147: playing cards at a small table, near which stood another, decorated with
LINE 148: an array of empty bottles and glasses. Sprawling on a lounge, with
LINE 149: flushed face and disheveled hair, his collar unfastened, his vest
LINE 150: buttoned awry, lay Tom Delamere, breathing stertorously, in what seemed
LINE 151: a drunken sleep. Lest there should be any doubt of the cause of his
LINE 152: condition, the fingers of his right hand had remained clasped
LINE 153: mechanically around the neck of a bottle which lay across his bosom.
LINE 154: Ellis turned away in disgust, and went slowly back to the ladies.
LINE 155: "There seems to be no one here yet," he reported. "We came a little
LINE 156: early for the evening crowd. The clerk says Tom Delamere was here to
LINE 157: luncheon, but he hasn't seen him for several hours."
LINE 158: "He's not a very gallant cavalier," said Mrs. Carteret severely. "He
LINE 159: ought to have been waiting for us."
LINE 160: Clara was clearly disappointed, and made no effort to conceal her
LINE 161: displeasure, leaving Ellis in doubt as to whether or not he were its
LINE 162: object. Perhaps she suspected him of not having made a very thorough
LINE 163: search. Her next remark might have borne such a construction.
LINE 164: "Sister Olivia," she said pettishly, "let's go up to the parlor. I can
LINE 165: play the piano anyway, if there's no one to talk to."
LINE 166: "I find it very comfortable here, Clara," replied her sister placidly.
LINE 167: "Mr. Ellis will go with you. You'll probably find some one in the
LINE 168: parlor, or they'll come when you begin to play."
LINE 169: Clara's expression was not cordial, but she rose as if to go. Ellis was
LINE 170: in a quandary. If she went through the hall, the chances were at least
LINE 171: even that she would see Delamere. He did not care a rap for
LINE 172: Delamere,--if he chose to make a public exhibition of himself, it was
LINE 173: his own affair; but to see him would surely spoil Miss Pemberton's
LINE 174: evening, and, in her frame of mind, might lead to the suspicion that
LINE 175: Ellis had prearranged the exposure. Even if she should not harbor this
LINE 176: unjust thought, she would not love the witness of her discomfiture. We
LINE 177: had rather not meet the persons who have seen, even though they never
LINE 178: mention, the skeletons in our closets. Delamere had disposed of himself
LINE 179: for the evening. Ellis would have a fairer field with Delamere out of
LINE 180: sight and unaccounted for, than with Delamere in evidence in his present
LINE 181: condition.
LINE 182: "Wouldn't you rather take a stroll on the beach, Miss Clara?" he asked,
LINE 183: in the hope of creating a diversion.
LINE 184: "No, I'm going to the parlor. _You_ needn't come, Mr. Ellis, if you'd
LINE 185: rather go down to the beach. I can quite as well go alone."
LINE 186: "I'd rather go with you," he said meekly.
LINE 187: They were moving toward the door opening into the hall, from which the
LINE 188: broad staircase ascended. Ellis, whose thoughts did not always respond
LINE 189: quickly to a sudden emergency, was puzzling his brain as to how he
LINE 190: should save her from any risk of seeing Delamere. Through the side door
LINE 191: leading from the hall into the office, he saw the bell-boy to whom he
LINE 192: had spoken seated on the bench provided for the servants.
LINE 193: "Won't you wait for me just a moment, Miss Clara, while I step into the
LINE 194: office? I'll be with you in an instant."
LINE 195: Clara hesitated.
LINE 196: "Oh, certainly," she replied nonchalantly.
LINE 197: Ellis went direct to the bell-boy. "Sit right where you are," he said,
LINE 198: "and don't move a hair. What is the lady in the hall doing?"
LINE 199: "She's got her back tu'ned this way, suh. I 'spec' she's lookin' at the
LINE 200: picture on the opposite wall, suh."
LINE 201: "All right," whispered Ellis, pressing a coin into the servant's hand.
LINE 202: "I'm going up to the parlor with the lady. You go up ahead of us, and
LINE 203: keep in front of us along the hall. Don't dare to look back. I shall
LINE 204: keep on talking to the lady, so that you can tell by my voice where we
LINE 205: are. When you get to room 256, go in and shut the door behind you:
LINE 206: pretend that you were called,--ask the gentlemen what they want,--tell
LINE 207: any kind of a lie you like,--but keep the door shut until you're sure
LINE 208: we've got by. Do you hear?"
LINE 209: "Yes, suh," replied the negro intelligently.
LINE 210: The plan worked without a hitch. Ellis talked steadily, about the hotel,
LINE 211: the furnishings, all sorts of irrelevant subjects, to which Miss
LINE 212: Pemberton paid little attention. She was angry with Delamere, and took
LINE 213: no pains to conceal her feelings. The bell-boy entered room 256 just
LINE 214: before they reached the door. Ellis had heard loud talking as they
LINE 215: approached, and as they were passing there was a crash of broken glass,
LINE 216: as though some object had been thrown at the door.
LINE 217: "What is the matter there?" exclaimed Clara, quickening her footsteps
LINE 218: and instinctively drawing closer to Ellis.
LINE 219: "Some one dropped a glass, I presume," replied Ellis calmly.
LINE 220: Miss Pemberton glanced at him suspiciously. She was in a decidedly
LINE 221: perverse mood. Seating herself at the piano, she played brilliantly for
LINE 222: a quarter of an hour. Quite a number of couples strolled up to the
LINE 223: parlor, but Delamere was not among them.
LINE 224: "Oh dear!" exclaimed Miss Pemberton, as she let her fingers fall upon
LINE 225: the keys with a discordant crash, after the last note, "I don't see why
LINE 226: we came out here to-night. Let's go back downstairs."
LINE 227: Ellis felt despondent. He had done his utmost to serve and to please
LINE 228: Miss Pemberton, but was not likely, he foresaw, to derive much benefit
LINE 229: from his opportunity. Delamere was evidently as much or more in her
LINE 230: thoughts by reason of his absence than if he had been present. If the
LINE 231: door should have been opened, and she should see him from the hall upon
LINE 232: their return, Ellis could not help it. He took the side next to the
LINE 233: door, however, meaning to hurry past the room so that she might not
LINE 234: recognize Delamere.
LINE 235: Fortunately the door was closed and all quiet within the room. On the
LINE 236: stairway they met the bellboy, rubbing his head with one hand and
LINE 237: holding a bottle of seltzer upon a tray in the other. The boy was well
LINE 238: enough trained to give no sign of recognition, though Ellis guessed the
LINE 239: destination of the bottle.
LINE 240: Ellis hardly knew whether to feel pleased or disappointed at the success
LINE 241: of his manoeuvres. He had spared Miss Pemberton some mortification, but
LINE 242: he had saved Tom Delamere from merited exposure. Clara ought to know the
LINE 243: truth, for her own sake.
LINE 244: On the beach, a few rods away, fires were burning, around which several
LINE 245: merry groups had gathered. The smoke went mostly to one side, but a
LINE 246: slight whiff came now and then to where Mrs. Carteret sat awaiting
LINE 247: them.
LINE 248: "They're roasting oysters," said Mrs. Carteret. "I wish you'd bring me
LINE 249: some, Mr. Ellis."
LINE 250: Ellis strolled down to the beach. A large iron plate, with a turned-up
LINE 251: rim like a great baking-pan, supported by legs which held it off the
LINE 252: ground, was set over a fire built upon the sand. This primitive oven was
LINE 253: heaped with small oysters in the shell, taken from the neighboring
LINE 254: sound, and hauled up to the hotel by a negro whose pony cart stood near
LINE 255: by. A wet coffee-sack of burlaps was spread over the oysters, which,
LINE 256: when steamed sufficiently, were opened by a colored man and served
LINE 257: gratis to all who cared for them.
LINE 258: Ellis secured a couple of plates of oysters, which he brought to Mrs.
LINE 259: Carteret and Clara; they were small, but finely flavored.
LINE 260: Meanwhile Delamere, who possessed a remarkable faculty of recuperation
LINE 261: from the effects of drink, had waked from his sleep, and remembering his
LINE 262: engagement, had exerted himself to overcome the ravages of the
LINE 263: afternoon's debauch. A dash of cold water braced him up somewhat. A
LINE 264: bottle of seltzer and a big cup of strong coffee still further
LINE 265: strengthened his nerves.
LINE 266: When Ellis returned to the veranda, after having taken away the plates,
LINE 267: Delamere had joined the ladies and was explaining the cause of his
LINE 268: absence.
LINE 269: He had been overcome by the heat, he said, while out fishing, and had
LINE 270: been lying down ever since. Perhaps he ought to have sent for a doctor,
LINE 271: but the fellows had looked after him. He hadn't sent word to his friends
LINE 272: because he hadn't wished to spoil their evening.
LINE 273: "That was very considerate of you, Tom," said Mrs. Carteret dryly, "but
LINE 274: you ought to have let us know. We have been worrying about you very
LINE 275: much. Clara has found the evening dreadfully dull."
LINE 276: "Indeed, no, sister Olivia," said the young lady cheerfully, "I've been
LINE 277: having a lovely time. Mr. Ellis and I have been up in the parlor; I
LINE 278: played the piano; and we've been eating oysters and having a most
LINE 279: delightful time. Won't you take me down there to the beach, Mr. Ellis? I
LINE 280: want to see the fires. Come on."
LINE 281: "Can't I go?" asked Tom jealously.
LINE 282: "No, indeed, you mustn't stir a foot! You must not overtax yourself so
LINE 283: soon; it might do you serious injury. Stay here with sister Olivia."
LINE 284: She took Ellis's arm with exaggerated cordiality. Delamere glared after
LINE 285: them angrily. Ellis did not stop to question her motives, but took the
LINE 286: goods the gods provided. With no very great apparent effort, Miss
LINE 287: Pemberton became quite friendly, and they strolled along the beach, in
LINE 288: sight of the hotel, for nearly half an hour. As they were coming up she
LINE 289: asked him abruptly,--
LINE 290: "Mr. Ellis, did you know Tom was in the hotel?"
LINE 291: Ellis was looking across the sound, at the lights of a distant steamer
LINE 292: which was making her way toward the harbor.
LINE 293: "I wonder," he said musingly, as though he had not heard her question,
LINE 294: "if that is the Ocean Belle?"
LINE 295: "And was he really sick?" she demanded.
LINE 296: "She's later than usual this trip," continued Ellis, pursuing his
LINE 297: thought. "She was due about five o'clock."
LINE 298: Miss Pemberton, under cover of the darkness, smiled a fine smile, which
LINE 299: foreboded ill for some one. When they joined the party on the piazza,
LINE 300: the major had come up and was saying that it was time to go. He had
LINE 301: been engaged in conversation, for most of the evening, with General
LINE 302: Belmont and several other gentlemen.
LINE 303: "Here comes the general now. Let me see. There are five of us. The
LINE 304: general has offered me a seat in his buggy, and Tom can go with
LINE 305: you-all."
LINE 306: The general came up and spoke to the ladies. Tom murmured his thanks; it
LINE 307: would enable him to make up a part of the delightful evening he had
LINE 308: missed.
LINE 309: When Mrs. Carteret had taken the rear seat, Clara promptly took the
LINE 310: place beside her. Ellis and Delamere sat in front. When Delamere, who
LINE 311: had offered to drive, took the reins, Ellis saw that his hands were
LINE 312: shaking.
LINE 313: "Give me the lines," he whispered. "Your nerves are unsteady and the
LINE 314: road is not well lighted."
LINE 315: Delamere prudently yielded the reins. He did not like Ellis's tone,
LINE 316: which seemed sneering rather than expressive of sympathy with one who
LINE 317: had been suffering. He wondered if the beggar knew anything about his
LINE 318: illness. Clara had been acting strangely. It would have been just like
LINE 319: Ellis to have slandered him. The upstart had no business with Clara
LINE 320: anyway. He would cheerfully have strangled Ellis, if he could have done
LINE 321: so with safety to himself and no chance of discovery.
LINE 322: The drive homeward through the night was almost a silent journey. Mrs.
LINE 323: Carteret was anxious about her baby. Clara did not speak, except now and
LINE 324: then to Ellis with reference to some object in or near the road.
LINE 325: Occasionally they passed a vehicle in the darkness, sometimes barely
LINE 326: avoiding a collision. Far to the north the sky was lit up with the glow
LINE 327: of a forest fire. The breeze from the Sound was deliciously cool. Soon
LINE 328: the last toll-gate was passed and the lights of the town appeared.
LINE 329: Ellis threw the lines to William, who was waiting, and hastened to help
LINE 330: the ladies out.
LINE 331: "Good-night, Mr. Ellis," said Clara sweetly, as she gave Ellis her hand.
LINE 332: "Thank you for a very pleasant evening. Come up and see us soon."
LINE 333: She ran into the house without a word to Tom.
