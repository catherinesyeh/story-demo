LINE 1: "Stay here beside her, major. I shall not he needed for an hour yet.
LINE 2: Meanwhile I'll go downstairs and snatch a bit of sleep, or talk to old
LINE 3: Jane."
LINE 4: The night was hot and sultry. Though the windows of the chamber were
LINE 5: wide open, and the muslin curtains looped back, not a breath of air was
LINE 6: stirring. Only the shrill chirp of the cicada and the muffled croaking
LINE 7: of the frogs in some distant marsh broke the night silence. The heavy
LINE 8: scent of magnolias, overpowering even the strong smell of drugs in the
LINE 9: sickroom, suggested death and funeral wreaths, sorrow and tears, the
LINE 10: long home, the last sleep. The major shivered with apprehension as the
LINE 11: slender hand which he held in his own contracted nervously and in a
LINE 12: spasm of pain clutched his fingers with a viselike grip.
LINE 13: Major Carteret, though dressed in brown linen, had thrown off his coat
LINE 14: for greater comfort. The stifling heat, in spite of the palm-leaf fan
LINE 15: which he plied mechanically, was scarcely less oppressive than his own
LINE 16: thoughts. Long ago, while yet a mere boy in years, he had come back from
LINE 17: Appomattox to find his family, one of the oldest and proudest in the
LINE 18: state, hopelessly impoverished by the war,--even their ancestral home
LINE 19: swallowed up in the common ruin. His elder brother had sacrificed his
LINE 20: life on the bloody altar of the lost cause, and his father, broken and
LINE 21: chagrined, died not many years later, leaving the major the last of his
LINE 22: line. He had tried in various pursuits to gain a foothold in the new
LINE 23: life, but with indifferent success until he won the hand of Olivia
LINE 24: Merkell, whom he had seen grow from a small girl to glorious womanhood.
LINE 25: With her money he had founded the Morning Chronicle, which he had made
LINE 26: the leading organ of his party and the most influential paper in the
LINE 27: State. The fine old house in which they lived was hers. In this very
LINE 28: room she had first drawn the breath of life; it had been their nuptial
LINE 29: chamber; and here, too, within a few hours, she might die, for it seemed
LINE 30: impossible that one could long endure such frightful agony and live.
LINE 31: One cloud alone had marred the otherwise perfect serenity of their
LINE 32: happiness. Olivia was childless. To have children to perpetuate the name
LINE 33: of which he was so proud, to write it still higher on the roll of
LINE 34: honor, had been his dearest hope. His disappointment had been
LINE 35: proportionately keen. A few months ago this dead hope had revived, and
LINE 36: altered the whole aspect of their lives. But as time went on, his wife's
LINE 37: age had begun to tell upon her, until even Dr. Price, the most cheerful
LINE 38: and optimistic of physicians, had warned him, while hoping for the best,
LINE 39: to be prepared for the worst. To add to the danger, Mrs. Carteret had
LINE 40: only this day suffered from a nervous shock, which, it was feared, had
LINE 41: hastened by several weeks the expected event.
LINE 42: Dr. Price went downstairs to the library, where a dim light was
LINE 43: burning. An old black woman, dressed in a gingham frock, with a red
LINE 44: bandana handkerchief coiled around her head by way of turban, was seated
LINE 45: by an open window. She rose and curtsied as the doctor entered and
LINE 46: dropped into a willow rocking-chair near her own.
LINE 47: "How did this happen, Jane?" he asked in a subdued voice, adding, with
LINE 48: assumed severity, "You ought to have taken better care of your
LINE 49: mistress."
LINE 50: "Now look a-hyuh, Doctuh Price," returned the old woman in an unctuous
LINE 51: whisper, "you don' wanter come talkin' none er yo' foolishness 'bout my
LINE 52: not takin' keer er Mis' 'Livy. _She_ never would 'a' said sech a thing!
LINE 53: Seven er eight mont's ago, w'en she sent fer me, I says ter her, says
LINE 54: I:--
LINE 55: "'Lawd, Lawd, honey! You don' tell me dat after all dese long w'ary
LINE 56: years er waitin' de good Lawd is done heared yo' prayer an' is gwine ter
LINE 57: sen' you de chile you be'n wantin' so long an' so bad? Bless his holy
LINE 58: name! Will I come an' nuss yo' baby? Why, honey, I nussed you, an'
LINE 59: nussed yo' mammy thoo her las' sickness, an' laid her out w'en she died.
LINE 60: I wouldn' _let_ nobody e'se nuss yo' baby; an' mo'over, I'm gwine ter
LINE 61: come an' nuss you too. You're young side er me, Mis' 'Livy, but you're
LINE 62: ove'ly ole ter be havin' yo' fus' baby, an' you'll need somebody roun',
LINE 63: honey, w'at knows all 'bout de fam'ly, an' deir ways an' deir
LINE 64: weaknesses, an' I don' know who dat'd be ef it wa'n't me.'
LINE 65: "''Deed, Mammy Jane,' says she, 'dere ain' nobody e'se I'd have but you.
LINE 66: You kin come ez soon ez you wanter an' stay ez long ez you mineter.'
LINE 67: "An hyuh I is, an' hyuh I'm gwine ter stay. Fer Mis' 'Livy is my ole
LINE 68: mist'ess's daughter, an' my ole mist'ess wuz good ter me, an' dey ain'
LINE 69: none er her folks gwine ter suffer ef ole Jane kin he'p it."
LINE 70: "Your loyalty does you credit, Jane," observed the doctor; "but you
LINE 71: haven't told me yet what happened to Mrs. Carteret to-day. Did the horse
LINE 72: run away, or did she see something that frightened her?"
LINE 73: "No, suh, de hoss didn' git skeered at nothin', but Mis' 'Livy did see
LINE 74: somethin', er somebody; an' it wa'n't no fault er mine ner her'n
LINE 75: neither,--it goes fu'ther back, suh, fu'ther dan dis day er dis year.
LINE 76: Does you 'member de time w'en my ole mist'ess, Mis' 'Livy upstairs's
LINE 77: mammy, died? No? Well, you wuz prob'ly 'way ter school den, studyin' ter
LINE 78: be a doctuh. But I'll tell you all erbout it.
LINE 79: "Wen my ole mist'ess, Mis' 'Liz'beth Merkell,--an' a good mist'ess she
LINE 80: wuz,--tuck sick fer de las' time, her sister Polly--ole Mis' Polly
LINE 81: Ochiltree w'at is now--come ter de house ter he'p nuss her. Mis' 'Livy
LINE 82: upstairs yander wuz erbout six years ole den, de sweetes' little angel
LINE 83: you ever laid eyes on; an' on her dyin' bed Mis' 'Liz'beth ax' Mis'
LINE 84: Polly fer ter stay hyuh an' take keer er her chile, an' Mis' Polly she
LINE 85: promise'. She wuz a widder fer de secon' time, an' didn' have no
LINE 86: child'en, an' could jes' as well come as not.
LINE 87: "But dere wuz trouble after de fune'al, an' it happen' right hyuh in dis
LINE 88: lib'ary. Mars Sam wuz settin' by de table, w'en Mis' Polly come
LINE 89: downstairs, slow an' solemn, an' stood dere in de middle er de flo', all
LINE 90: in black, till Mars Sam sot a cheer fer her.
LINE 91: "'Well, Samuel,' says she, 'now dat we've done all we can fer po'
LINE 92: 'Liz'beth, it only 'mains fer us ter consider Olivia's future.'
LINE 93: "Mars Sam nodded his head, but didn' say nothin'.
LINE 94: "'I don' need ter tell you,' says she,' dat I am willin' ter carry out
LINE 95: de wishes er my dead sister, an' sac'ifice my own comfo't, an' make
LINE 96: myse'f yo' housekeeper an' yo' child's nuss, fer my dear sister's sake.
LINE 97: It wuz her dyin' wish, an' on it I will ac', ef it is also yo'n.'
LINE 98: "Mars Sam didn' want Mis' Polly ter come, suh; fur he didn' like Mis'
LINE 99: Polly. He wuz skeered er Miss Polly."
LINE 100: "I don't wonder," yawned the doctor, "if she was anything like she is
LINE 101: now."
LINE 102: "Wuss, suh, fer she wuz younger, an' stronger. She always would have her
LINE 103: say, no matter 'bout what, an' her own way, no matter who 'posed her.
LINE 104: She had already be'n in de house fer a week, an' Mars Sam knowed ef she
LINE 105: once come ter stay, she'd be de mist'ess of eve'ybody in it an' him
LINE 106: too. But w'at could he do but say yas?
LINE 107: "'Den it is unde'stood, is it,' says Mis' Polly, w'en he had spoke, 'dat
LINE 108: I am ter take cha'ge er de house?'
LINE 109: "'All right, Polly,' says Mars Sam, wid a deep sigh.
LINE 110: "Mis' Polly 'lowed he wuz sighin' fer my po' dead mist'ess, fer she didn'
LINE 111: have no idee er his feelin's to'ds her,--she alluz did 'low dat all
LINE 112: de gent'emen wuz in love wid 'er.
LINE 113: "'You won' fin' much ter do,' Mars Sam went on, 'fer Julia is a good
LINE 114: housekeeper, an' kin ten' ter mos' eve'ything, under yo' d'rections.'
LINE 115: "Mis' Polly stiffen' up like a ramrod. 'It mus' be unde'stood, Samuel,'
LINE 116: says she, 'dat w'en I 'sumes cha'ge er yo' house, dere ain' gwine ter be
LINE 117: no 'vided 'sponsibility; an' as fer dis Julia, me an' her couldn' git
LINE 118: 'long tergether nohow. Ef I stays, Julia goes.'
LINE 119: "Wen Mars Sam beared dat, he felt better, an' 'mence' ter pick up his
LINE 120: courage. Mis' Polly had showed her ban' too plain. My mist'ess hadn'
LINE 121: got col' yit, an' Mis' Polly, who'd be'n a widder fer two years dis
LINE 122: las' time, wuz already fig'rin' on takin' her place fer good, an' she
LINE 123: did n! want no other woman roun' de house dat Mars Sam might take a'
LINE 124: intrus' in.
LINE 125: "'My dear Polly,' says Mars Sam, quite determine', 'I couldn' possibly
LINE 126: sen' Julia 'way. Fac' is, I couldn' git 'long widout Julia. She'd be'n
LINE 127: runnin' dis house like clockwo'k befo' you come, an' I likes her ways.
LINE 128: My dear, dead 'Liz'beth sot a heap er sto' by Julia, an' I'm gwine ter
LINE 129: keep her here fer 'Liz'beth's sake.'
LINE 130: "Mis' Polly's eyes flash' fire.
LINE 131: "'Ah,' says she,' I see--I see! You perfers her housekeepin' ter mine,
LINE 132: indeed! Dat is a fine way ter talk ter a lady! An' a heap er rispec' you
LINE 133: is got fer de mem'ry er my po' dead sister!'
LINE 134: "Mars Sam knowed w'at she 'lowed she seed wa'n't so; but he didn' let
LINE 135: on, fer it only made him de safer. He wuz willin' fer her ter 'magine w'at
LINE 136: she please', jes' so long ez she kep' out er his house an' let him
LINE 137: alone.
LINE 138: "'No, Polly,' says he, gittin' bolder ez she got madder, 'dere ain' no
LINE 139: use talkin'. Nothin' in de worl' would make me part wid Julia.'
LINE 140: "Mis' Polly she r'ared an' she pitch', but Mars Sam helt on like grim
LINE 141: death. Mis' Polly wouldn' give in neither, an' so she fin'lly went
LINE 142: away. Dey made some kind er 'rangement afterwa'ds, an' Miss Polly tuck
LINE 143: Mis' 'Livy ter her own house. Mars Sam paid her bo'd an' 'lowed Mis'
LINE 144: Polly somethin' fer takin' keer er her."
LINE 145: "And Julia stayed?"
LINE 146: "Julia stayed, suh, an' a couple er years later her chile wuz bawn,
LINE 147: right here in dis house."
LINE 148: "But you said," observed the doctor, "that Mrs. Ochiltree was in error
LINE 149: about Julia."
LINE 150: "Yas, suh, so she wuz, w'en my ole mist'ess died. But dis wuz two years
LINE 151: after,--an' w'at has ter be has ter be. Julia had a easy time; she had a
LINE 152: black gal ter wait on her, a buggy to ride in, an' eve'ything she
LINE 153: wanted. Eve'ybody s'posed Mars Sam would give her a house an' lot, er
LINE 154: leave her somethin' in his will. But he died suddenly, and didn' leave
LINE 155: no will, an' Mis' Polly got herse'f 'pinted gyardeen ter young Mis'
LINE 156: 'Livy, an' driv Julia an' her young un out er de house, an' lived here
LINE 157: in dis house wid Mis' 'Livy till Mis' 'Livy ma'ied Majah Carteret."
LINE 158: "And what became of Julia?" asked Dr. Price.
LINE 159: Such relations, the doctor knew very well, had been all too common in
LINE 160: the old slavery days, and not a few of them had been projected into the
LINE 161: new era. Sins, like snakes, die hard. The habits and customs of a people
LINE 162: were not to be changed in a day, nor by the stroke of a pen. As family
LINE 163: physician, and father confessor by brevet, Dr. Price had looked upon
LINE 164: more than one hidden skeleton; and no one in town had had better
LINE 165: opportunities than old Jane for learning the undercurrents in the lives
LINE 166: of the old families.
LINE 167: "Well," resumed Jane, "eve'ybody s'posed, after w'at had happen', dat
LINE 168: Julia'd keep on livin' easy, fer she wuz young an' good-lookin'. But
LINE 169: she didn'. She tried ter make a livin' sewin', but Mis' Polly wouldn'
LINE 170: let de bes' w'ite folks hire her. Den she tuck up washin', but didn' do
LINE 171: no better at dat; an' bimeby she got so discourage' dat she ma'ied a
LINE 172: shif'less yaller man, an' died er consumption soon after,--an' wuz
LINE 173: 'bout ez well off, fer dis man couldn' hardly feed her nohow."
LINE 174: "And the child?"
LINE 175: "One er de No'the'n w'ite lady teachers at de mission school tuck a
LINE 176: likin' ter little Janet, an' put her thoo school, an' den sent her off
LINE 177: ter de No'th fer ter study ter be a school teacher. W'en she come back,
LINE 178: 'stead er teachin' she ma'ied ole Adam Miller's son."
LINE 179: "The rich stevedore's son, Dr. Miller?"
LINE 180: "Yas, suh, dat's de man,--you knows 'im. Dis yer boy wuz jes' gwine
LINE 181: 'way fer ter study ter be a doctuh, an' he ma'ied dis Janet, an' tuck
LINE 182: her 'way wid 'im. Dey went off ter Europe, er Irope, er Orope, er
LINE 183: somewhere er 'nother, 'way off yander, an' come back here las' year an'
LINE 184: sta'ted dis yer horspital an' school fer ter train de black gals fer
LINE 185: nusses."
LINE 186: "He's a very good doctor, Jane, and is doing a useful work. Your
LINE 187: chapter of family history is quite interesting,--I knew part of it
LINE 188: before, in a general way; but you haven't yet told me what brought on
LINE 189: Mrs. Carteret's trouble."
LINE 190: "I'm jes' comin' ter dat dis minute, suh,--w'at I be'n tellin' you is
LINE 191: all a part of it. Dis yer Janet, w'at's Mis' 'Livy's half-sister, is ez
LINE 192: much like her ez ef dey wuz twins. Folks sometimes takes 'em fer one
LINE 193: ernudder,--I s'pose it tickles Janet mos' ter death, but it do make Mis'
LINE 194: 'Livy rippin'. An' den 'way back yander jes' after de wah, w'en de ole
LINE 195: Carteret mansion had ter be sol', Adam Miller bought it, an' dis yer
LINE 196: Janet an' her husban' is be'n livin' in it ever sence ole Adam died,
LINE 197: 'bout a year ago; an' dat makes de majah mad, 'ca'se he don' wanter see
LINE 198: cullud folks livin' in de ole fam'ly mansion w'at he wuz bawn in. An'
LINE 199: mo'over, an' dat's de wust of all, w'iles Mis' 'Livy ain' had no
LINE 200: child'en befo', dis yer sister er her'n is got a fine-lookin' little
LINE 201: yaller boy, w'at favors de fam'ly so dat ef Mis' 'Livy'd see de chile
LINE 202: anywhere, it'd mos' break her heart fer ter think 'bout her not havin'
LINE 203: no child'en herse'f. So ter-day, w'en Mis' 'Livy wuz out ridin' an' met
LINE 204: dis yer Janet wid her boy, an' w'en Mis' 'Livy got ter studyin' 'bout
LINE 205: her own chances, an' how she mought not come thoo safe, she jes' had a
LINE 206: fit er hysterics right dere in de buggy. She wuz mos' home, an' William
LINE 207: got her here, an' you knows de res'."
LINE 208: Major Carteret, from the head of the stairs, called the doctor
LINE 209: anxiously.
LINE 210: "You had better come along up now, Jane," said the doctor.
LINE 211: For two long hours they fought back the grim spectre that stood by the
LINE 212: bedside. The child was born at dawn. Both mother and child, the doctor
LINE 213: said, would live.
LINE 214: "Bless its 'ittle hea't!" exclaimed Mammy Jane, as she held up the tiny
LINE 215: mite, which bore as much resemblance to mature humanity as might be
LINE 216: expected of an infant which had for only a few minutes drawn the breath
LINE 217: of life. "Bless its 'ittle hea't! it's de we'y spit an' image er its
LINE 218: pappy!"
LINE 219: The doctor smiled. The major laughed aloud. Jane's unconscious
LINE 220: witticism, or conscious flattery, whichever it might be, was a welcome
LINE 221: diversion from the tense strain of the last few hours.
LINE 222: "Be that as it may," said Dr. Price cheerfully, "and I'll not dispute
LINE 223: it, the child is a very fine boy,--a very fine boy, indeed! Take care of
LINE 224: it, major," he added with a touch of solemnity, "for your wife can never
LINE 225: bear another."
LINE 226: With the child's first cry a refreshing breeze from the distant ocean
LINE 227: cooled the hot air of the chamber; the heavy odor of the magnolias, with
LINE 228: its mortuary suggestiveness, gave place to the scent of rose and lilac
LINE 229: and honeysuckle. The birds in the garden were singing lustily.
LINE 230: All these sweet and pleasant things found an echo in the major's heart.
LINE 231: He stood by the window, and looking toward the rising sun, breathed a
LINE 232: silent prayer of thanksgiving. All nature seemed to rejoice in sympathy
LINE 233: with his happiness at the fruition of this long-deferred hope, and to
LINE 234: predict for this wonderful child a bright and glorious future.
LINE 235: Old Mammy Jane, however, was not entirely at ease concerning the child.
LINE 236: She had discovered, under its left ear, a small mole, which led her to
LINE 237: fear that the child was born for bad luck. Had the baby been black, or
LINE 238: yellow, or poor-white, Jane would unhesitatingly have named, as his
LINE 239: ultimate fate, a not uncommon form of taking off, usually resultant upon
LINE 240: the infraction of certain laws, or, in these swift modern days, upon too
LINE 241: violent a departure from established social customs. It was manifestly
LINE 242: impossible that a child of such high quality as the grandson of her old
LINE 243: mistress should die by judicial strangulation; but nevertheless the
LINE 244: warning was a serious thing, and not to be lightly disregarded.
LINE 245: Not wishing to be considered as a prophet of evil omen, Jane kept her
LINE 246: own counsel in regard to this significant discovery. But later, after
LINE 247: the child was several days old, she filled a small vial with water in
LINE 248: which the infant had been washed, and took it to a certain wise old
LINE 249: black woman, who lived on the farther edge of the town and was well
LINE 250: known to be versed in witchcraft and conjuration. The conjure woman
LINE 251: added to the contents of the bottle a bit of calamus root, and one of
LINE 252: the cervical vertebrae from the skeleton of a black cat, with several
LINE 253: other mysterious ingredients, the nature of which she did not disclose.
LINE 254: Following instructions given her, Aunt Jane buried the bottle in
LINE 255: Carteret's back yard, one night during the full moon, as a good-luck
LINE 256: charm to ward off evil from the little grandson of her dear mistress, so
LINE 257: long since dead and gone to heaven.
