LINE 1: They named the Carteret baby Theodore Felix. Theodore was a family name,
LINE 2: and had been borne by the eldest son for several generations, the major
LINE 3: himself being a second son. Having thus given the child two beautiful
LINE 4: names, replete with religious and sentimental significance, they called
LINE 5: him--"Dodie."
LINE 6: The baby was christened some six weeks after its birth, by which time
LINE 7: Mrs. Carteret was able to be out. Old Mammy Jane, who had been brought
LINE 8: up in the church, but who, like some better informed people in all ages,
LINE 9: found religion not inconsistent with a strong vein of superstition, felt
LINE 10: her fears for the baby's future much relieved when the rector had made
LINE 11: the sign of the cross and sprinkled little Dodie with the water from the
LINE 12: carved marble font, which had come from England in the reign of King
LINE 13: Charles the Martyr, as the ill-fated son of James I. was known to St.
LINE 14: Andrew's. Upon this special occasion Mammy Jane had been provided with a
LINE 15: seat downstairs among the white people, to her own intense satisfaction,
LINE 16: and to the secret envy of a small colored attendance in the gallery, to
LINE 17: whom she was ostentatiously pointed out by her grandson Jerry, porter at
LINE 18: the Morning Chronicle office, who sat among them in the front row.
LINE 19: On the following Monday evening the major gave a christening party in
LINE 20: honor of this important event. Owing to Mrs. Carteret's still delicate
LINE 21: health, only a small number of intimate friends and family connections
LINE 22: were invited to attend. These were the rector of St. Andrew's; old Mrs.
LINE 23: Polly Ochiltree, the godmother; old Mr. Delamere, a distant relative and
LINE 24: also one of the sponsors; and his grandson, Tom Delamere. The major had
LINE 25: also invited Lee Ellis, his young city editor, for whom he had a great
LINE 26: liking apart from his business value, and who was a frequent visitor at
LINE 27: the house. These, with the family itself, which consisted of the major,
LINE 28: his wife, and his half-sister, Clara Pemberton, a young woman of about
LINE 29: eighteen, made up the eight persons for whom covers were laid.
LINE 30: Ellis was the first to arrive, a tall, loose-limbed young man, with a
LINE 31: slightly freckled face, hair verging on auburn, a firm chin, and honest
LINE 32: gray eyes. He had come half an hour early, and was left alone for a few
LINE 33: minutes in the parlor, a spacious, high-ceilinged room, with large
LINE 34: windows, and fitted up in excellent taste, with stately reminiscences of
LINE 35: a past generation. The walls were hung with figured paper. The ceiling
LINE 36: was whitewashed, and decorated in the middle with a plaster
LINE 37: centre-piece, from which hung a massive chandelier sparkling with
LINE 38: prismatic rays from a hundred crystal pendants. There was a handsome
LINE 39: mantel, set with terra-cotta tiles, on which fauns and satyrs, nymphs
LINE 40: and dryads, disported themselves in idyllic abandon. The furniture was
LINE 41: old, and in keeping with the room.
LINE 42: At seven o'clock a carriage drove up, from which alighted an elderly
LINE 43: gentleman, with white hair and mustache, and bowed somewhat with years.
LINE 44: Short of breath and painfully weak in the legs, he was assisted from the
LINE 45: carriage by a colored man, apparently about forty years old, to whom
LINE 46: short side-whiskers and spectacles imparted an air of sobriety. This
LINE 47: attendant gave his arm respectfully to the old gentleman, who leaned
LINE 48: upon it heavily, but with as little appearance of dependence as
LINE 49: possible. The servant, assuming a similar unconsciousness of the weight
LINE 50: resting upon his arm, assisted the old gentleman carefully up the steps.
LINE 51: "I'm all right now, Sandy," whispered the gentleman as soon as his feet
LINE 52: were planted firmly on the piazza. "You may come back for me at nine
LINE 53: o'clock."
LINE 54: Having taken his hand from his servant's arm, he advanced to meet a lady
LINE 55: who stood in the door awaiting him, a tall, elderly woman, gaunt and
LINE 56: angular of frame, with a mottled face, and high cheekbones partially
LINE 57: covered by bands of hair entirely too black and abundant for a person of
LINE 58: her age, if one might judge from the lines of her mouth, which are
LINE 59: rarely deceptive in such matters.
LINE 60: "Perhaps you'd better not send your man away, Mr. Delamere," observed
LINE 61: the lady, in a high shrill voice, which grated upon the old gentleman's
LINE 62: ears. He was slightly hard of hearing, but, like most deaf people,
LINE 63: resented being screamed at. "You might need him before nine o'clock. One
LINE 64: never knows what may happen after one has had the second stroke. And
LINE 65: moreover, our butler has fallen down the back steps--negroes are so
LINE 66: careless!--and sprained his ankle so that he can't stand. I'd like to
LINE 67: have Sandy stay and wait on the table in Peter's place, if you don't
LINE 68: mind."
LINE 69: "I thank you, Mrs. Ochiltree, for your solicitude," replied Mr.
LINE 70: Delamere, with a shade of annoyance in his voice, "but my health is very
LINE 71: good just at present, and I do not anticipate any catastrophe which will
LINE 72: require my servant's presence before I am ready to go home. But I have
LINE 73: no doubt, madam," he continued, with a courteous inclination, "that
LINE 74: Sandy will be pleased to serve you, if you desire it, to the best of his
LINE 75: poor knowledge."
LINE 76: "I shill be honored, ma'am," assented Sandy, with a bow even deeper than
LINE 77: his master's, "only I'm 'feared I ain't rightly dressed fer ter wait on
LINE 78: table. I wuz only goin' ter pra'r-meetin', an' so I didn' put on my
LINE 79: bes' clo's. Ef Mis' Ochiltree ain' gwine ter need me fer de nex' fifteen
LINE 80: minutes, I kin ride back home in de ca'ige an' dress myse'f suitable fer
LINE 81: de occasion, suh."
LINE 82: "If you think you'll wait on the table any better," said Mrs.
LINE 83: Ochiltree, "you may go along and change your clothes; but hurry back,
LINE 84: for it is seven now, and dinner will soon be served."
LINE 85: Sandy retired with a bow. While descending the steps to the carriage,
LINE 86: which had waited for him, he came face to face with a young man just
LINE 87: entering the house.
LINE 88: "Am I in time for dinner, Sandy?" asked the newcomer.
LINE 89: "Yas, Mistuh Tom, you're in plenty er time. Dinner won't be ready till
LINE 90: _I_ git back, which won' be fer fifteen minutes er so yit."
LINE 91: Throwing away the cigarette which he held between his fingers, the young
LINE 92: man crossed the piazza with a light step, and after a preliminary knock,
LINE 93: for an answer to which he did not wait, entered the house with the air
LINE 94: of one thoroughly at home. The lights in the parlor had been lit, and
LINE 95: Ellis, who sat talking to Major Carteret when the newcomer entered,
LINE 96: covered him with a jealous glance.
LINE 97: Slender and of medium height, with a small head of almost perfect
LINE 98: contour, a symmetrical face, dark almost to swarthiness, black eyes,
LINE 99: which moved somewhat restlessly, curly hair of raven tint, a slight
LINE 100: mustache, small hands and feet, and fashionable attire, Tom Delamere,
LINE 101: the grandson of the old gentleman who had already arrived, was easily
LINE 102: the handsomest young man in Wellington. But no discriminating observer
LINE 103: would have characterized his beauty as manly. It conveyed no impression
LINE 104: of strength, but did possess a certain element, feline rather than
LINE 105: feminine, which subtly negatived the idea of manliness.
LINE 106: He gave his hand to the major, nodded curtly to Ellis, saluted his
LINE 107: grandfather respectfully, and inquired for the ladies.
LINE 108: "Olivia is dressing for dinner," replied the major; "Mrs. Ochiltree is
LINE 109: in the kitchen, struggling with the servants. Clara--Ah, here she comes
LINE 110: now!"
LINE 111: Ellis, whose senses were preternaturally acute where Clara was
LINE 112: concerned, was already looking toward the hall and was the first to see
LINE 113: her. Clad in an evening gown of simple white, to the close-fitting
LINE 114: corsage of which she had fastened a bunch of pink roses, she was to
LINE 115: Ellis a dazzling apparition. To him her erect and well-moulded form was
LINE 116: the embodiment of symmetry, her voice sweet music, her movements the
LINE 117: perfection of grace; and it scarcely needed a lover's imagination to
LINE 118: read in her fair countenance a pure heart and a high spirit,--the
LINE 119: truthfulness that scorns a lie, the pride which is not haughtiness.
LINE 120: There were suggestive depths of tenderness, too, in the curl of her lip,
LINE 121: the droop of her long lashes, the glance of her blue eyes,--depths that
LINE 122: Ellis had long since divined, though he had never yet explored them. She
LINE 123: gave Ellis a friendly nod as she came in, but for the smile with which
LINE 124: she greeted Delamere, Ellis would have given all that he
LINE 125: possessed,--not a great deal, it is true, but what could a man do more?
LINE 126: "You are the last one, Tom," she said reproachfully. "Mr. Ellis has been
LINE 127: here half an hour."
LINE 128: Delamere threw a glance at Ellis which was not exactly friendly. Why
LINE 129: should this fellow always be on hand to emphasize his own shortcomings?
LINE 130: "The rector is not here," answered Tom triumphantly. "You see I am not
LINE 131: the last."
LINE 132: "The rector," replied Clara, "was called out of town at six o'clock this
LINE 133: evening, to visit a dying man, and so cannot be here. You are the last,
LINE 134: Tom, and Mr. Ellis was the first."
LINE 135: Ellis was ruefully aware that this comparison in his favor was the only
LINE 136: visible advantage that he had gained from his early arrival. He had not
LINE 137: seen Miss Pemberton a moment sooner by reason of it. There had been a
LINE 138: certain satisfaction in being in the same house with her, but Delamere
LINE 139: had arrived in time to share or, more correctly, to monopolize, the
LINE 140: sunshine of her presence.
LINE 141: Delamere gave a plausible excuse which won Clara's pardon and another
LINE 142: enchanting smile, which pierced Ellis like a dagger. He knew very well
LINE 143: that Delamere's excuse was a lie. Ellis himself had been ready as early
LINE 144: as six o'clock, but judging this to be too early, had stopped in at the
LINE 145: Clarendon Club for half an hour, to look over the magazines. While
LINE 146: coming out he had glanced into the card-room, where he had seen his
LINE 147: rival deep in a game of cards, from which Delamere had evidently not
LINE 148: been able to tear himself until the last moment. He had accounted for
LINE 149: his lateness by a story quite inconsistent with these facts.
LINE 150: The two young people walked over to a window on the opposite side of
LINE 151: the large room, where they stood talking to one another in low tones.
LINE 152: The major had left the room for a moment. Old Mr. Delamere, who was
LINE 153: watching his grandson and Clara with an indulgent smile, proceeded to
LINE 154: rub salt into Ellis's wounds.
LINE 155: "They make a handsome couple," he observed. "I remember well when her
LINE 156: mother, in her youth an ideally beautiful woman, of an excellent family,
LINE 157: married Daniel Pemberton, who was not of so good a family, but had made
LINE 158: money. The major, who was only a very young man then, disapproved of the
LINE 159: match; he considered that his mother, although a widow and nearly forty,
LINE 160: was marrying beneath her. But he has been a good brother to Clara, and a
LINE 161: careful guardian of her estate. Ah, young gentleman, you cannot
LINE 162: appreciate, except in imagination, what it means, to one standing on the
LINE 163: brink of eternity, to feel sure that he will live on in his children and
LINE 164: his children's children!"
LINE 165: Ellis was appreciating at that moment what it meant, in cold blood, with
LINE 166: no effort of the imagination, to see the girl whom he loved absorbed
LINE 167: completely in another man. She had looked at him only once since Tom
LINE 168: Delamere had entered the room, and then merely to use him as a spur with
LINE 169: which to prick his favored rival.
LINE 170: "Yes, sir," he returned mechanically, "Miss Clara is a beautiful young
LINE 171: lady."
LINE 172: "And Tom is a good boy--a fine boy," returned the old gentleman. "I am
LINE 173: very well pleased with Tom, and shall be entirely happy when I see them
LINE 174: married."
LINE 175: Ellis could not echo this sentiment. The very thought of this marriage
LINE 176: made him miserable. He had always understood that the engagement was
LINE 177: merely tentative, a sort of family understanding, subject to
LINE 178: confirmation after Delamere should have attained his majority, which was
LINE 179: still a year off, and when the major should think Clara old enough to
LINE 180: marry. Ellis saw Delamere with the eye of a jealous rival, and judged
LINE 181: him mercilessly,--whether correctly or not the sequel will show. He did
LINE 182: not at all believe that Tom Delamere would make a fit husband for Clara
LINE 183: Pemberton; but his opinion would have had no weight,--he could hardly
LINE 184: have expressed it without showing his own interest. Moreover, there was
LINE 185: no element of the sneak in Lee Ellis's make-up. The very fact that he
LINE 186: might profit by the other's discomfiture left Delamere secure, so far as
LINE 187: he could be affected by anything that Ellis might say. But Ellis did not
LINE 188: shrink from a fair fight, and though in this one the odds were heavily
LINE 189: against him, yet so long as this engagement remained indefinite, so
LINE 190: long, indeed, as the object of his love was still unwed, he would not
LINE 191: cease to hope. Such a sacrifice as this marriage clearly belonged in the
LINE 192: catalogue of impossibilities. Ellis had not lived long enough to learn
LINE 193: that impossibilities are merely things of which we have not learned, or
LINE 194: which we do not wish to happen.
LINE 195: Sandy returned at the end of a quarter of an hour, and dinner was
LINE 196: announced. Mr. Delamere led the way to the dining-room with Mrs.
LINE 197: Ochiltree. Tom followed with Clara. The major went to the head of the
LINE 198: stairs and came down with Mrs. Carteret upon his arm, her beauty
LINE 199: rendered more delicate by the pallor of her countenance and more
LINE 200: complete by the happiness with which it glowed. Ellis went in alone. In
LINE 201: the rector's absence it was practically a family party which sat down,
LINE 202: with the exception of Ellis, who, as we have seen, would willingly have
LINE 203: placed himself in the same category.
LINE 204: The table was tastefully decorated with flowers, which grew about the
LINE 205: house in lavish profusion. In warm climates nature adorns herself with
LINE 206: true feminine vanity.
LINE 207: "What a beautiful table!" exclaimed Tom, before they were seated.
LINE 208: "The decorations are mine," said Clara proudly. "I cut the flowers and
LINE 209: arranged them all myself."
LINE 210: "Which accounts for the admirable effect," rejoined Tom with a bow,
LINE 211: before Ellis, to whom the same thought had occurred, was able to express
LINE 212: himself. He had always counted himself the least envious of men, but for
LINE 213: this occasion he coveted Tom Delamere's readiness.
LINE 214: "The beauty of the flowers," observed old Mr. Delamere, with sententious
LINE 215: gallantry, "is reflected upon all around them. It is a handsome
LINE 216: company."
LINE 217: Mrs. Ochiltree beamed upon the table with a dry smile.
LINE 218: "I don't perceive any effect that it has upon you or me," she said; "And
LINE 219: as for the young people, 'Handsome is as handsome does.' If Tom here,
LINE 220: for instance, were as good as he looks"--
LINE 221: "You flatter me, Aunt Polly," Tom broke in hastily, anticipating the
LINE 222: crack of the whip; he was familiar with his aunt's conversational
LINE 223: idiosyncrasies.
LINE 224: "If you are as good as you look," continued the old lady, with a cunning
LINE 225: but indulgent smile, "some one has been slandering you."
LINE 226: "Thanks, Aunt Polly! Now you don't flatter me."
LINE 227: "There is Mr. Ellis," Mrs. Ochiltree went on, "who is not half so
LINE 228: good-looking, but is steady as a clock, I dare say."
LINE 229: "Now, Aunt Polly," interposed Mrs. Carteret, "let the gentlemen alone."
LINE 230: "She doesn't mean half what she says," continued Mrs. Carteret
LINE 231: apologetically, "and only talks that way to people whom she likes."
LINE 232: Tom threw Mrs. Carteret a grateful glance. He had been apprehensive,
LINE 233: with the sensitiveness of youth, lest his old great-aunt should make a
LINE 234: fool of him before Clara's family. Nor had he relished the comparison
LINE 235: with Ellis, who was out of place, anyway, in this family party. He had
LINE 236: never liked the fellow, who was too much of a plodder and a prig to make
LINE 237: a suitable associate for a whole-souled, generous-hearted young
LINE 238: gentleman. He tolerated him as a visitor at Carteret's and as a member
LINE 239: of the Clarendon Club, but that was all.
LINE 240: "Mrs. Ochiltree has a characteristic way of disguising her feelings,"
LINE 241: observed old Mr. Delamere, with a touch of sarcasm.
LINE 242: Ellis had merely flushed and felt uncomfortable at the reference to
LINE 243: himself. The compliment to his character hardly offset the reflection
LINE 244: upon his looks. He knew he was not exactly handsome, but it was not
LINE 245: pleasant to have the fact emphasized in the presence of the girl he
LINE 246: loved; he would like at least fair play, and judgment upon the subject
LINE 247: left to the young lady.
LINE 248: Mrs. Ochiltree was quietly enjoying herself. In early life she had been
LINE 249: accustomed to impale fools on epigrams, like flies on pins, to see them
LINE 250: wriggle. But with advancing years she had lost in some measure the
LINE 251: faculty of nice discrimination,--it was pleasant to see her victims
LINE 252: squirm, whether they were fools or friends. Even one's friends, she
LINE 253: argued, were not always wise, and were sometimes the better for being
LINE 254: told the truth. At her niece's table she felt at liberty to speak her
LINE 255: mind, which she invariably did, with a frankness that sometimes bordered
LINE 256: on brutality. She had long ago outgrown the period where ambition or
LINE 257: passion, or its partners, envy and hatred, were springs of action in her
LINE 258: life, and simply retained a mild enjoyment in the exercise of an old
LINE 259: habit, with no active malice whatever. The ruling passion merely grew
LINE 260: stronger as the restraining faculties decreased in vigor.
LINE 261: A diversion was created at this point by the appearance of old Mammy
LINE 262: Jane, dressed in a calico frock, with clean white neckerchief and apron,
LINE 263: carrying the wonderful baby in honor of whose naming this feast had been
LINE 264: given. Though only six weeks old, the little Theodore had grown rapidly,
LINE 265: and Mammy Jane declared was already quite large for his age, and
LINE 266: displayed signs of an unusually precocious intelligence. He was passed
LINE 267: around the table and duly admired. Clara thought his hair was fine.
LINE 268: Ellis inquired about his teeth. Tom put his finger in the baby's fist to
LINE 269: test his grip. Old Mr. Delamere was unable to decide as yet whether he
LINE 270: favored most his father or his mother. The object of these attentions
LINE 271: endured them patiently for several minutes, and then protested with a
LINE 272: vocal vigor which led to his being taken promptly back upstairs.
LINE 273: Whatever fate might be in store for him, he manifested no sign of weak
LINE 274: lungs.
LINE 275: "Sandy," said Mrs. Carteret when the baby had retired, "pass that tray
LINE 276: standing upon the side table, so that we may all see the presents."
LINE 277: Mr. Delamere had brought a silver spoon, and Tom a napkin ring. Ellis
LINE 278: had sent a silver watch; it was a little premature, he admitted, but
LINE 279: the boy would grow to it, and could use it to play with in the mean
LINE 280: time. It had a glass back, so that he might see the wheels go round.
LINE 281: Mrs. Ochiltree's present was an old and yellow ivory rattle, with a
LINE 282: handle which the child could bite while teething, and a knob screwed on
LINE 283: at the end to prevent the handle from slipping through the baby's hand.
LINE 284: "I saw that in your cedar chest, Aunt Polly," said Clara, "when I was a
LINE 285: little girl, and you used to pull the chest out from under your bed to
LINE 286: get me a dime."
LINE 287: "You kept the rattle in the right-hand corner of the chest," said Tom,
LINE 288: "in the box with the red silk purse, from which you took the gold piece
LINE 289: you gave me every Christmas."
LINE 290: A smile shone on Mrs. Ochiltree's severe features at this appreciation,
LINE 291: like a ray of sunlight on a snowbank.
LINE 292: "Aunt Polly's chest is like the widow's cruse," said Mrs. Carteret,
LINE 293: "which was never empty."
LINE 294: "Or Fortunatus's purse, which was always full," added old Mr. Delamere,
LINE 295: who read the Latin poets, and whose allusions were apt to be classical
LINE 296: rather than scriptural.
LINE 297: "It will last me while I live," said Mrs. Ochiltree, adding cautiously,
LINE 298: "but there'll not be a great deal left. It won't take much to support
LINE 299: an old woman for twenty years."
LINE 300: Mr. Delamere's man Sandy had been waiting upon the table with the
LINE 301: decorum of a trained butler, and a gravity all his own. He had changed
LINE 302: his suit of plain gray for a long blue coat with brass buttons, which
LINE 303: dated back to the fashion of a former generation, with which he wore a
LINE 304: pair of plaid trousers of strikingly modern cut and pattern. With his
LINE 305: whiskers, his spectacles, and his solemn air of responsibility, he would
LINE 306: have presented, to one unfamiliar with the negro type, an amusingly
LINE 307: impressive appearance. But there was nothing incongruous about Sandy to
LINE 308: this company, except perhaps to Tom Delamere, who possessed a keen eye
LINE 309: for contrasts and always regarded Sandy, in that particular rig, as a
LINE 310: very comical darkey.
LINE 311: "Is it quite prudent, Mrs. Ochiltree," suggested the major at a moment
LINE 312: when Sandy, having set down the tray, had left the room for a little
LINE 313: while, "to mention, in the presence of the servants, that you keep money
LINE 314: in the house?"
LINE 315: "I beg your pardon, major," observed old Mr. Delamere, with a touch of
LINE 316: stiffness. "The only servant in hearing of the conversation has been my
LINE 317: own; and Sandy is as honest as any man in Wellington."
LINE 318: "You mean, sir," replied Carteret, with a smile, "as honest as any negro
LINE 319: in Wellington."
LINE 320: "I make no exceptions, major," returned the old gentleman, with
LINE 321: emphasis. "I would trust Sandy with my life,--he saved it once at the
LINE 322: risk of his own."
LINE 323: "No doubt," mused the major, "the negro is capable of a certain doglike
LINE 324: fidelity,--I make the comparison in a kindly sense,--a certain personal
LINE 325: devotion which is admirable in itself, and fits him eminently for a
LINE 326: servile career. I should imagine, however, that one could more safely
LINE 327: trust his life with a negro than his portable property."
LINE 328: "Very clever, major! I read your paper, and know that your feeling is
LINE 329: hostile toward the negro, but"--
LINE 330: The major made a gesture of dissent, but remained courteously silent
LINE 331: until Mr. Delamere had finished.
LINE 332: "For my part," the old gentleman went on, "I think they have done very
LINE 333: well, considering what they started from, and their limited
LINE 334: opportunities. There was Adam Miller, for instance, who left a
LINE 335: comfortable estate. His son George carries on the business, and the
LINE 336: younger boy, William, is a good doctor and stands well with his
LINE 337: profession. His hospital is a good thing, and if my estate were clear, I
LINE 338: should like to do something for it."
LINE 339: "You are mistaken, sir, in imagining me hostile to the negro," explained
LINE 340: Carteret. "On the contrary, I am friendly to his best interests. I give
LINE 341: him employment; I pay taxes for schools to educate him, and for
LINE 342: court-houses and jails to keep him in order. I merely object to being
LINE 343: governed by an inferior and servile race."
LINE 344: Mrs. Carteret's face wore a tired expression. This question was her
LINE 345: husband's hobby, and therefore her own nightmare. Moreover, she had her
LINE 346: personal grievance against the negro race, and the names mentioned by
LINE 347: old Mr. Delamere had brought it vividly before her mind. She had no
LINE 348: desire to mar the harmony of the occasion by the discussion of a
LINE 349: distasteful subject.
LINE 350: Mr. Delamere, glancing at his hostess, read something of this thought,
LINE 351: and refused the challenge to further argument.
LINE 352: "I do not believe, major," he said, "that Olivia relishes the topic. I
LINE 353: merely wish to say that Sandy is an exception to any rule which you may
LINE 354: formulate in derogation of the negro. Sandy is a gentleman in ebony!"
LINE 355: Tom could scarcely preserve his gravity at this characterization of old
LINE 356: Sandy, with his ridiculous air of importance, his long blue coat, and
LINE 357: his loud plaid trousers. That suit would make a great costume for a
LINE 358: masquerade. He would borrow it some time,--there was nothing in the
LINE 359: world like it.
LINE 360: "Well, Mr. Delamere," returned the major good-humoredly, "no doubt Sandy
LINE 361: is an exceptionally good negro,--he might well be, for he has had the
LINE 362: benefit of your example all his life,--and we know that he is a faithful
LINE 363: servant. But nevertheless, if I were Mrs. Ochiltree, I should put my
LINE 364: money in the bank. Not all negroes are as honest as Sandy, and an
LINE 365: elderly lady might not prove a match for a burly black burglar."
LINE 366: "Thank you, major," retorted Mrs. Ochiltree, with spirit, "I'm not yet
LINE 367: too old to take care of myself. That cedar chest has been my bank for
LINE 368: forty years, and I shall not change my habits at my age."
LINE 369: At this moment Sandy reëntered the room. Carteret made a warning
LINE 370: gesture, which Mrs. Ochiltree chose not to notice.
LINE 371: "I've proved a match for two husbands, and am not afraid of any man
