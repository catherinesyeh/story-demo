LINE 1: The proceedings of the day--planned originally as a "demonstration,"
LINE 2: dignified subsequently as a "revolution," under any name the culmination
LINE 3: of the conspiracy formed by Carteret and his colleagues--had by seven
LINE 4: o'clock in the afternoon developed into a murderous riot. Crowds of
LINE 5: white men and half-grown boys, drunk with whiskey or with license, raged
LINE 6: through the streets, beating, chasing, or killing any negro so
LINE 7: unfortunate as to fall into their hands. Why any particular negro was
LINE 8: assailed, no one stopped to inquire; it was merely a white mob thirsting
LINE 9: for black blood, with no more conscience or discrimination than would be
LINE 10: exercised by a wolf in a sheepfold. It was race against race, the whites
LINE 11: against the negroes; and it was a one-sided affair, for until Josh Green
LINE 12: got together his body of armed men, no effective resistance had been
LINE 13: made by any colored person, and the individuals who had been killed had
LINE 14: so far left no marks upon the enemy by which they might be remembered.
LINE 15: "Kill the niggers!" rang out now and then through the dusk, and far down
LINE 16: the street and along the intersecting thoroughfares distant voices took
LINE 17: up the ominous refrain,--"Kill the niggers! Kill the damned niggers!"
LINE 18: Now, not a dark face had been seen on the street for half an hour,
LINE 19: until the group of men headed by Josh made their appearance in the negro
LINE 20: quarter. Armed with guns and axes, they presented quite a formidable
LINE 21: appearance as they made their way toward the new hospital, near which
LINE 22: stood a schoolhouse and a large church, both used by the colored people.
LINE 23: They did not reach their destination without having met a number of
LINE 24: white men, singly or in twos or threes; and the rumor spread with
LINE 25: incredible swiftness that the negroes in turn were up in arms,
LINE 26: determined to massacre all the whites and burn the town. Some of the
LINE 27: whites became alarmed, and recognizing the power of the negroes, if
LINE 28: armed and conscious of their strength, were impressed by the immediate
LINE 29: necessity of overpowering and overawing them. Others, with appetites
LINE 30: already whetted by slaughter, saw a chance, welcome rather than not, of
LINE 31: shedding more black blood. Spontaneously the white mob flocked toward
LINE 32: the hospital, where rumor had it that a large body of desperate negroes,
LINE 33: breathing threats of blood and fire, had taken a determined stand.
LINE 34: It had been Josh's plan merely to remain quietly and peaceably in the
LINE 35: neighborhood of the little group of public institutions, molesting no
LINE 36: one, unless first attacked, and merely letting the white people see that
LINE 37: they meant to protect their own; but so rapidly did the rumor spread,
LINE 38: and so promptly did the white people act, that by the time Josh and his
LINE 39: supporters had reached the top of the rising ground where the hospital
LINE 40: stood, a crowd of white men much more numerous than their own party were
LINE 41: following them at a short distance.
LINE 42: Josh, with the eye of a general, perceived that some of his party were
LINE 43: becoming a little nervous, and decided that they would feel safer behind
LINE 44: shelter.
LINE 45: "I reckon we better go inside de hospittle, boys," he exclaimed. "Den
LINE 46: we'll be behind brick walls, an' dem other fellows 'll be outside, an' ef
LINE 47: dere's any fightin', we'll have de bes' show. We ain' gwine ter do no
LINE 48: shootin' till we're pestered, an' dey'll be less likely ter pester us
LINE 49: ef dey can't git at us widout runnin' some resk. Come along in! Be men!
LINE 50: De gov'ner er de President is gwine ter sen' soldiers ter stop dese
LINE 51: gwines-on, an' meantime we kin keep dem white devils f'm bu'nin' down
LINE 52: our hospittles an' chu'ch-houses. Wen dey comes an' fin's out dat we
LINE 53: jes' means ter pertect ou' prope'ty, dey'll go 'long 'bout deir own
LINE 54: business. Er, ef dey wants a scrap, dey kin have it! Come erlong, boys!"
LINE 55: Jerry Letlow, who had kept out of sight during the day, had started out,
LINE 56: after night had set in, to find Major Carteret. Jerry was very much
LINE 57: afraid. The events of the day had filled him with terror. Whatever the
LINE 58: limitations of Jerry's mind or character may have been, Jerry had a keen
LINE 59: appreciation of the danger to the negroes when they came in conflict
LINE 60: with the whites, and he had no desire to imperil his own skin. He valued
LINE 61: his life for his own sake, and not for any altruistic theory that it
LINE 62: might be of service to others. In other words, Jerry was something of a
LINE 63: coward. He had kept in hiding all day, but finding, toward evening, that
LINE 64: the riot did not abate, and fearing, from the rumors which came to his
LINE 65: ears, that all the negroes would be exterminated, he had set out,
LINE 66: somewhat desperately, to try to find his white patron and protector. He
LINE 67: had been cautious to avoid meeting any white men, and, anticipating no
LINE 68: danger from those of his own race, went toward the party which he saw
LINE 69: approaching, whose path would cross his own. When they were only a few
LINE 70: yards apart, Josh took a step forward and caught Jerry by the arm.
LINE 71: "Come along, Jerry, we need you! Here's another man, boys. Come on now,
LINE 72: and fight fer yo' race!"
LINE 73: In vain Jerry protested. "I don' wan' ter fight," he howled. "De w'ite
LINE 74: folks ain' gwine ter pester me; dey're my frien's. Tu'n me loose,--tu'n
LINE 75: me loose, er we all gwine ter git killed!"
LINE 76: The party paid no attention to Jerry's protestations. Indeed, with the
LINE 77: crowd of whites following behind, they were simply considering the
LINE 78: question of a position from which they could most effectively defend
LINE 79: themselves and the building which they imagined to be threatened. If
LINE 80: Josh had released his grip of Jerry, that worthy could easily have
LINE 81: escaped from the crowd; but Josh maintained his hold almost
LINE 82: mechanically, and, in the confusion, Jerry found himself swept with the
LINE 83: rest into the hospital, the doors of which were promptly barricaded with
LINE 84: the heavier pieces of furniture, and the windows manned by several men
LINE 85: each, Josh, with the instinct of a born commander, posting his forces so
LINE 86: that they could cover with their guns all the approaches to the
LINE 87: building. Jerry still continuing to make himself troublesome, Josh, in a
LINE 88: moment of impatience, gave him a terrific box on the ear, which
LINE 89: stretched him out upon the floor unconscious.
LINE 90: "Shet up," he said; "ef you can't stan' up like a man, keep still, and
LINE 91: don't interfere wid men w'at will fight!" The hospital, when Josh and
LINE 92: his men took possession, had been found deserted. Fortunately there were
LINE 93: no patients for that day, except one or two convalescents, and these,
LINE 94: with the attendants, had joined the exodus of the colored people from
LINE 95: the town.
LINE 96: A white man advanced from the crowd without toward the main entrance to
LINE 97: the hospital. Big Josh, looking out from a window, grasped his gun more
LINE 98: firmly, as his eyes fell upon the man who had murdered his father and
LINE 99: darkened his mother's life. Mechanically he raised his rifle, but
LINE 100: lowered it as the white man lifted up his hand as a sign that he wished
LINE 101: to speak.
LINE 102: "You niggers," called Captain McBane loudly,--it was that worthy,--"you
LINE 103: niggers are courtin' death, an' you won't have to court her but a minute
LINE 104: er two mo' befo' she'll have you. If you surrender and give up your
LINE 105: arms, you'll be dealt with leniently,--you may get off with the
LINE 106: chain-gang or the penitentiary. If you resist, you'll be shot like
LINE 107: dogs."
LINE 108: "Dat's no news, Mr. White Man," replied Josh, appearing boldly at the
LINE 109: window. "We're use' ter bein' treated like dogs by men like you. If you
LINE 110: w'ite people will go 'long an' ten' ter yo' own business an' let us
LINE 111: alone, we'll ten' ter ou'n. You've got guns, an' we've got jest as
LINE 112: much right ter carry 'em as you have. Lay down yo'n, an' we'll lay down
LINE 113: ou'n,--we didn' take 'em up fust; but we ain' gwine ter let you bu'n
LINE 114: down ou' chu'ches an' school'ouses, er dis hospittle, an' we ain' comin'
LINE 115: out er dis house, where we ain' disturbin' nobody, fer you ter shoot us
LINE 116: down er sen' us ter jail. You hear me!"
LINE 117: "All right," responded McBane. "You've had fair warning. Your blood be
LINE 118: on your"--His speech was interrupted by a shot from the crowd, which
LINE 119: splintered the window-casing close to Josh's head. This was followed by
LINE 120: half a dozen other shots, which were replied to, almost simultaneously,
LINE 121: by a volley from within, by which one of the attacking party was killed
LINE 122: and another wounded.
LINE 123: This roused the mob to frenzy.
LINE 124: "Vengeance! vengeance!" they yelled. "Kill the niggers!"
LINE 125: A negro had killed a white man,--the unpardonable sin, admitting neither
LINE 126: excuse, justification, nor extenuation. From time immemorial it had been
LINE 127: bred in the Southern white consciousness, and in the negro consciousness
LINE 128: also, for that matter, that the person of a white man was sacred from
LINE 129: the touch of a negro, no matter what the provocation. A dozen colored
LINE 130: men lay dead in the streets of Wellington, inoffensive people, slain in
LINE 131: cold blood because they had been bold enough to question the authority
LINE 132: of those who had assailed them, or frightened enough to flee when they
LINE 133: had been ordered to stand still; but their lives counted nothing against
LINE 134: that of a riotous white man, who had courted death by attacking a body
LINE 135: of armed men.
LINE 136: The crowd, too, surrounding the hospital, had changed somewhat in
LINE 137: character. The men who had acted as leaders in the early afternoon,
LINE 138: having accomplished their purpose of overturning the local
LINE 139: administration and establishing a provisional government of their own,
LINE 140: had withdrawn from active participation in the rioting, deeming the
LINE 141: negroes already sufficiently overawed to render unlikely any further
LINE 142: trouble from that source. Several of the ringleaders had indeed begun to
LINE 143: exert themselves to prevent further disorder, or any loss of property,
LINE 144: the possibility of which had become apparent; but those who set in
LINE 145: motion the forces of evil cannot always control them afterwards. The
LINE 146: baser element of the white population, recruited from the wharves and
LINE 147: the saloons, was now predominant.
LINE 148: Captain McBane was the only one of the revolutionary committee who had
LINE 149: remained with the mob, not with any purpose to restore or preserve
LINE 150: order, but because he found the company and the occasion entirely
LINE 151: congenial. He had had no opportunity, at least no tenable excuse, to
LINE 152: kill or maim a negro since the termination of his contract with the
LINE 153: state for convicts, and this occasion had awakened a dormant appetite
LINE 154: for these diversions. We are all puppets in the hands of Fate, and
LINE 155: seldom see the strings that move us. McBane had lived a life of violence
LINE 156: and cruelty. As a man sows, so shall he reap. In works of fiction, such
LINE 157: men are sometimes converted. More often, in real life, they do not
LINE 158: change their natures until they are converted into dust. One does well
LINE 159: to distrust a tamed tiger.
LINE 160: On the outskirts of the crowd a few of the better class, or at least of
LINE 161: the better clad, were looking on. The double volley described had
LINE 162: already been fired, when the number of these was augmented by the
LINE 163: arrival of Major Carteret and Mr. Ellis, who had just come from the
LINE 164: Chronicle office, where the next day's paper had been in hasty
LINE 165: preparation. They pushed their way towards the front of the crowd.
LINE 166: "This must be stopped, Ellis," said Carteret. "They are burning houses
LINE 167: and killing women and children. Old Jane, good old Mammy Jane, who
LINE 168: nursed my wife at her bosom, and has waited on her and my child within
LINE 169: a few weeks, was killed only a few rods from my house, to which she was
LINE 170: evidently fleeing for protection. It must have been by accident,--I
LINE 171: cannot believe that any white man in town would be dastard enough to
LINE 172: commit such a deed intentionally! I would have defended her with my own
LINE 173: life! We must try to stop this thing!"
LINE 174: "Easier said than done," returned Ellis. "It is in the fever stage, and
LINE 175: must burn itself out. We shall be lucky if it does not burn the town
LINE 176: out. Suppose the negroes should also take a hand at the burning? We have
LINE 177: advised the people to put the negroes down, and they are doing the job
LINE 178: thoroughly."
LINE 179: "My God!" replied the other, with a gesture of impatience, as he
LINE 180: continued to elbow his way through the crowd; "I meant to keep them in
LINE 181: their places,--I did not intend wholesale murder and arson."
LINE 182: Carteret, having reached the front of the mob, made an effort to gain
LINE 183: their attention.
LINE 184: "Gentlemen!" he cried in his loudest tones. His voice, unfortunately,
LINE 185: was neither loud nor piercing.
LINE 186: "Kill the niggers!" clamored the mob.
LINE 187: "Gentlemen, I implore you"--
LINE 188: The crash of a dozen windows, broken by stones and pistol shots, drowned
LINE 189: his voice.
LINE 190: "Gentlemen!" he shouted; "this is murder, it is madness; it is a
LINE 191: disgrace to our city, to our state, to our civilization!"
LINE 192: "That's right!" replied several voices. The mob had recognized the
LINE 193: speaker. "It _is_ a disgrace, and we'll not put up with it a moment
LINE 194: longer. Burn 'em out! Hurrah for Major Carteret, the champion of 'white
LINE 195: supremacy'! Three cheers for the Morning Chronicle and 'no nigger
LINE 196: domination'!"
LINE 197: "Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!" yelled the crowd.
LINE 198: In vain the baffled orator gesticulated and shrieked in the effort to
LINE 199: correct the misapprehension. Their oracle had spoken; not hearing what
LINE 200: he said, they assumed it to mean encouragement and coöperation. Their
LINE 201: present course was but the logical outcome of the crusade which the
LINE 202: Morning Chronicle had preached, in season and out of season, for many
LINE 203: months. When Carteret had spoken, and the crowd had cheered him, they
LINE 204: felt that they had done all that courtesy required, and he was
LINE 205: good-naturedly elbowed aside while they proceeded with the work in hand,
LINE 206: which was now to drive out the negroes from the hospital and avenge the
LINE 207: killing of their comrade.
LINE 208: Some brought hay, some kerosene, and others wood from a pile which had
LINE 209: been thrown into a vacant lot near by. Several safe ways of approach to
LINE 210: the building were discovered, and the combustibles placed and fired. The
LINE 211: flames, soon gaining a foothold, leaped upward, catching here and there
LINE 212: at the exposed woodwork, and licking the walls hungrily with long
LINE 213: tongues of flame.
LINE 214: Meanwhile a desultory firing was kept up from the outside, which was
LINE 215: replied to scatteringly from within the hospital. Those inside were
LINE 216: either not good marksmen, or excitement had spoiled their aim. If a face
LINE 217: appeared at a window, a dozen pistol shots from the crowd sought the
LINE 218: spot immediately.
LINE 219: Higher and higher leaped the flames. Suddenly from one of the windows
LINE 220: sprang a black figure, waving a white handkerchief. It was Jerry Letlow.
LINE 221: Regaining consciousness after the effect of Josh's blow had subsided,
LINE 222: Jerry had kept quiet and watched his opportunity. From a safe
LINE 223: vantage-ground he had scanned the crowd without, in search of some
LINE 224: white friend. When he saw Major Carteret moving disconsolately away
LINE 225: after his futile effort to stem the torrent, Jerry made a dash for the
LINE 226: window. He sprang forth, and, waving his handkerchief as a flag of
LINE 227: truce, ran toward Major Carteret, shouting frantically:--
LINE 228: "Majah Carteret--_O_ majah! It's me, suh, Jerry, suh! I didn' go in
LINE 229: dere myse'f, suh--I wuz drag' in dere! I wouldn' do nothin' 'g'inst de
LINE 230: w'ite folks, suh,--no, 'ndeed, I wouldn', suh!"
LINE 231: Jerry's cries were drowned in a roar of rage and a volley of shots from
LINE 232: the mob. Carteret, who had turned away with Ellis, did not even hear his
LINE 233: servant's voice. Jerry's poor flag of truce, his explanations, his
LINE 234: reliance upon his white friends, all failed him in the moment of supreme
LINE 235: need. In that hour, as in any hour when the depths of race hatred are
LINE 236: stirred, a negro was no more than a brute beast, set upon by other brute
LINE 237: beasts whose only instinct was to kill and destroy.
LINE 238: "Let us leave this inferno, Ellis," said Carteret, sick with anger and
LINE 239: disgust. He had just become aware that a negro was being killed, though
LINE 240: he did not know whom. "We can do nothing. The negroes have themselves to
LINE 241: blame,--they tempted us beyond endurance. I counseled firmness, and firm
LINE 242: measures were taken, and our purpose was accomplished. I am not
LINE 243: responsible for these subsequent horrors,--I wash my hands of them. Let
LINE 244: us go!"
LINE 245: The flames gained headway and gradually enveloped the burning building,
LINE 246: until it became evident to those within as well as those without that
LINE 247: the position of the defenders was no longer tenable. Would they die in
LINE 248: the flames, or would they be driven out? The uncertainty soon came to an
LINE 249: end.
LINE 250: The besieged had been willing to fight, so long as there seemed a hope
LINE 251: of successfully defending themselves and their property; for their
LINE 252: purpose was purely one of defense. When they saw the case was hopeless,
LINE 253: inspired by Josh Green's reckless courage, they were still willing to
LINE 254: sell their lives dearly. One or two of them had already been killed, and
LINE 255: as many more disabled. The fate of Jerry Letlow had struck terror to the
LINE 256: hearts of several others, who could scarcely hide their fear. After the
LINE 257: building had been fired, Josh's exhortations were no longer able to keep
LINE 258: them in the hospital. They preferred to fight and be killed in the open,
LINE 259: rather than to be smothered like rats in a hole.
LINE 260: "Boys!" exclaimed Josh,--"men!--fer nobody but men would do w'at you
LINE 261: have done,--the day has gone 'g'inst us. We kin see ou' finish; but fer
LINE 262: my part, I ain' gwine ter leave dis worl' widout takin' a w'ite man
LINE 263: 'long wid me, an' I sees my man right out yonder waitin',--I be'n
LINE 264: waitin' fer him twenty years, but he won' have ter wait fer me mo' 'n
LINE 265: 'bout twenty seconds. Eve'y one er you pick yo' man! We'll open de do',
LINE 266: an' we'll give some w'ite men a chance ter be sorry dey ever started
LINE 267: dis fuss!"
LINE 268: The door was thrown open suddenly, and through it rushed a dozen or more
LINE 269: black figures, armed with knives, pistols, or clubbed muskets. Taken by
LINE 270: sudden surprise, the white people stood motionless for a moment, but the
LINE 271: approaching negroes had scarcely covered half the distance to which the
LINE 272: heat of the flames had driven back the mob, before they were greeted
LINE 273: with a volley that laid them all low but two. One of these, dazed by
LINE 274: the fate of his companions, turned instinctively to flee, but had
LINE 275: scarcely faced around before he fell, pierced in the back by a dozen
LINE 276: bullets.
LINE 277: Josh Green, the tallest and biggest of them all, had not apparently been
LINE 278: touched. Some of the crowd paused in involuntary admiration of this
LINE 279: black giant, famed on the wharves for his strength, sweeping down upon
LINE 280: them, a smile upon his face, his eyes lit up with a rapt expression
LINE 281: which seemed to take him out of mortal ken. This impression was
LINE 282: heightened by his apparent immunity from the shower of lead which less
LINE 283: susceptible persons had continued to pour at him.
LINE 284: Armed with a huge bowie-knife, a relic of the civil war, which he had
LINE 285: carried on his person for many years for a definite purpose, and which
LINE 286: he had kept sharpened to a razor edge, he reached the line of the crowd.
LINE 287: All but the bravest shrank back. Like a wedge he dashed through the mob,
LINE 288: which parted instinctively before him, and all oblivious of the rain of
LINE 289: lead which fell around him, reached the point where Captain McBane, the
LINE 290: bravest man in the party, stood waiting to meet him. A pistol-flame
LINE 291: flashed in his face, but he went on, and raising his powerful right arm,
LINE 292: buried his knife to the hilt in the heart of his enemy. When the crowd
LINE 293: dashed forward to wreak vengeance on his dead body, they found him with
LINE 294: a smile still upon his face.
LINE 295: One of the two died as the fool dieth. Which was it, or was it both?
LINE 296: "Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord, and it had not been left to Him.
LINE 297: But they that do violence must expect to suffer violence. McBane's death
LINE 298: was merciful, compared with the nameless horrors he had heaped upon the
LINE 299: hundreds of helpless mortals who had fallen into his hands during his
LINE 300: career as a contractor of convict labor.
LINE 301: Sobered by this culminating tragedy, the mob shortly afterwards
LINE 302: dispersed. The flames soon completed their work, and this handsome
LINE 303: structure, the fruit of old Adam Miller's industry, the monument of his
LINE 304: son's philanthropy, a promise of good things for the future of the city,
LINE 305: lay smouldering in ruins, a melancholy witness to the fact that our
LINE 306: boasted civilization is but a thin veneer, which cracks and scales off
LINE 307: at the first impact of primal passions.
