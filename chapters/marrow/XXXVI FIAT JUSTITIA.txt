LINE 1: By the light of the burning building, which illuminated the street for
LINE 2: several blocks, Major Carteret and Ellis made their way rapidly until
LINE 3: they turned into the street where the major lived. Reaching the house,
LINE 4: Carteret tried the door and found it locked. A vigorous ring at the bell
LINE 5: brought no immediate response. Carteret had begun to pound impatiently
LINE 6: upon the door, when it was cautiously opened by Miss Pemberton, who was
LINE 7: pale, and trembled with excitement.
LINE 8: "Where is Olivia?" asked the major.
LINE 9: "She is upstairs, with Dodie and Mrs. Albright's hospital nurse. Dodie
LINE 10: has the croup. Virgie ran away after the riot broke out. Sister Olivia
LINE 11: had sent for Mammy Jane, but she did not come. Mrs. Albright let her
LINE 12: white nurse come over."
LINE 13: "I'll go up at once," said the major anxiously. "Wait for me,
LINE 14: Ellis,--I'll be down in a few minutes."
LINE 15: "Oh, Mr. Ellis," exclaimed Clara, coming toward him with both hands
LINE 16: extended, "can nothing be done to stop this terrible affair?"
LINE 17: "I wish I could do something," he murmured fervently, taking both her
LINE 18: trembling hands in his own broad palms, where they rested with a
LINE 19: surrendering trustfulness which he has never since had occasion to
LINE 20: doubt. "It has gone too far, already, and the end, I fear, is not yet;
LINE 21: but it cannot grow much worse." The editor hurried upstairs. Mrs.
LINE 22: Carteret, wearing a worried and haggard look, met him at the threshold
LINE 23: of the nursery.
LINE 24: "Dodie is ill," she said. "At three o'clock, when the trouble began, I
LINE 25: was over at Mrs. Albright's,--I had left Virgie with the baby. When I
LINE 26: came back, she and all the other servants had gone. They had heard that
LINE 27: the white people were going to kill all the negroes, and fled to seek
LINE 28: safety. I found Dodie lying in a draught, before an open window, gasping
LINE 29: for breath. I ran back to Mrs. Albright's,--I had found her much better
LINE 30: to-day,--and she let her nurse come over. The nurse says that Dodie is
LINE 31: threatened with membranous croup."
LINE 32: "Have you sent for Dr. Price?"
LINE 33: "There was no one to send,--the servants were gone, and the nurse was
LINE 34: afraid to venture out into the street. I telephoned for Dr. Price, and
LINE 35: found that he was out of town; that he had gone up the river this
LINE 36: morning to attend a patient, and would not be back until to-morrow. Mrs.
LINE 37: Price thought that he had anticipated some kind of trouble in the town
LINE 38: to-day, and had preferred to be where he could not be called upon to
LINE 39: assume any responsibility."
LINE 40: "I suppose you tried Dr. Ashe?"
LINE 41: "I could not get him, nor any one else, after that first call. The
LINE 42: telephone service is disorganized on account of the riot. We need
LINE 43: medicine and ice. The drugstores are all closed on account of the riot,
LINE 44: and for the same reason we couldn't get any ice."
LINE 45: Major Carteret stood beside the brass bedstead upon which his child was
LINE 46: lying,--his only child, around whose curly head clustered all his hopes;
LINE 47: upon whom all his life for the past year had been centred. He stooped
LINE 48: over the bed, beside which the nurse had stationed herself. She was
LINE 49: wiping the child's face, which was red and swollen and covered with
LINE 50: moisture, the nostrils working rapidly, and the little patient vainly
LINE 51: endeavoring at intervals to cough up the obstruction to his breathing.
LINE 52: "Is it serious?" he inquired anxiously. He had always thought of the
LINE 53: croup as a childish ailment, that yielded readily to proper treatment;
LINE 54: but the child's evident distress impressed him with sudden fear.
LINE 55: "Dangerous," replied the young woman laconically. "You came none too
LINE 56: soon. If a doctor isn't got at once, the child will die,--and it must
LINE 57: be a good doctor."
LINE 58: "Whom can I call?" he asked. "You know them all, I suppose. Dr. Price,
LINE 59: our family physician, is out of town."
LINE 60: "Dr. Ashe has charge of his cases when he is away," replied the nurse.
LINE 61: "If you can't find him, try Dr. Hooper. The child is growing worse every
LINE 62: minute. On your way back you'd better get some ice, if possible."
LINE 63: The major hastened downstairs.
LINE 64: "Don't wait for me, Ellis," he said. "I shall be needed here for a
LINE 65: while. I'll get to the office as soon as possible. Make up the paper,
LINE 66: and leave another stick out for me to the last minute, but fill it up in
LINE 67: case I'm not on hand by twelve. We must get the paper out early in the
LINE 68: morning."
LINE 69: Nothing but a matter of the most vital importance would have kept Major
LINE 70: Carteret away from his office this night. Upon the presentation to the
LINE 71: outer world of the story of this riot would depend the attitude of the
LINE 72: great civilized public toward the events of the last ten hours. The
LINE 73: Chronicle was the source from which the first word would be expected; it
LINE 74: would give the people of Wellington their cue as to the position which
LINE 75: they must take in regard to this distressful affair, which had so far
LINE 76: transcended in ferocity the most extreme measures which the conspirators
LINE 77: had anticipated. The burden of his own responsibility weighed heavily
LINE 78: upon him, and could not be shaken off; but he must do first the duty
LINE 79: nearest to him,--he must first attend to his child.
LINE 80: Carteret hastened from the house, and traversed rapidly the short
LINE 81: distance to Dr. Ashe's office. Far down the street he could see the glow
LINE 82: of the burning hospital, and he had scarcely left his own house when the
LINE 83: fusillade of shots, fired when the colored men emerged from the burning
LINE 84: building, was audible. Carteret would have hastened back to the scene of
LINE 85: the riot, to see what was now going on, and to make another effort to
LINE 86: stem the tide of bloodshed; but before the dread of losing his child,
LINE 87: all other interests fell into the background. Not all the negroes in
LINE 88: Wellington could weigh in the balance for one instant against the life
LINE 89: of the feeble child now gasping for breath in the house behind him.
LINE 90: Reaching the house, a vigorous ring brought the doctor's wife to the
LINE 91: door.
LINE 92: "Good evening, Mrs. Ashe. Is the doctor at home?"
LINE 93: "No, Major Carteret. He was called to attend Mrs. Wells, who was taken
LINE 94: suddenly ill, as a result of the trouble this afternoon. He will be
LINE 95: there all night, no doubt."
LINE 96: "My child is very ill, and I must find some one."
LINE 97: "Try Dr. Yates. His house is only four doors away."
LINE 98: A ring at Dr. Yates's door brought out a young man.
LINE 99: "Is Dr. Yates in?"
LINE 100: "Yes, sir."
LINE 101: "Can I see him?"
LINE 102: "You might see him, sir, but that would be all. His horse was frightened
LINE 103: by the shooting on the streets, and ran away and threw the doctor, and
LINE 104: broke his right arm. I have just set it; he will not be able to attend
LINE 105: any patients for several weeks. He is old and nervous, and the shock was
LINE 106: great."
LINE 107: "Are you not a physician?" asked Carteret, looking at the young man
LINE 108: keenly. He was a serious, gentlemanly looking young fellow, whose word
LINE 109: might probably be trusted.
LINE 110: "Yes, I am Dr. Evans, Dr. Yates's assistant. I'm really little more
LINE 111: than a student, but I'll do what I can."
LINE 112: "My only child is sick with the croup, and requires immediate
LINE 113: attention."
LINE 114: "I ought to be able to handle a case of the croup," answered Dr. Evans,
LINE 115: "at least in the first stages. I'll go with you, and stay by the child,
LINE 116: and if the case is beyond me, I may keep it in check until another
LINE 117: physician comes."
LINE 118: He stepped back into another room, and returning immediately with his
LINE 119: hat, accompanied Carteret homeward. The riot had subsided; even the glow
LINE 120: from the smouldering hospital was no longer visible. It seemed that the
LINE 121: city, appalled at the tragedy, had suddenly awakened to a sense of its
LINE 122: own crime. Here and there a dark face, emerging cautiously from some
LINE 123: hiding-place, peered from behind fence or tree, but shrank hastily away
LINE 124: at the sight of a white face. The negroes of Wellington, with the
LINE 125: exception of Josh Green and his party, had not behaved bravely on this
LINE 126: critical day in their history; but those who had fought were dead, to
LINE 127: the last man; those who had sought safety in flight or concealment were
LINE 128: alive to tell the tale.
LINE 129: "We pass right by Dr. Thompson's," said Dr. Evans. "If you haven't
LINE 130: spoken to him, it might be well to call him for consultation, in case
LINE 131: the child should be very bad."
LINE 132: "Go on ahead," said Carteret, "and I'll get him."
LINE 133: Evans hastened on, while Carteret sounded the old-fashioned knocker upon
LINE 134: the doctor's door. A gray-haired negro servant, clad in a dress suit and
LINE 135: wearing a white tie, came to the door.
LINE 136: "De doctuh, suh," he replied politely to Carteret's question, "has gone
LINE 137: ter ampitate de ahm er a gent'eman who got one er his bones smashed wid
LINE 138: a pistol bullet in de--fightin' dis atternoon, suh. He's jes' gone, suh,
LINE 139: an' lef' wo'd dat he'd be gone a' hour er mo', suh."
LINE 140: Carteret hastened homeward. He could think of no other available
LINE 141: physician. Perhaps no other would be needed, but if so, he could find
LINE 142: out from Evans whom it was best to call.
LINE 143: When he reached the child's room, the young doctor was bending anxiously
LINE 144: over the little frame. The little lips had become livid, the little
LINE 145: nails, lying against the white sheet, were blue. The child's efforts to
LINE 146: breathe were most distressing, and each gasp cut the father like a
LINE 147: knife. Mrs. Carteret was weeping hysterically. "How is he, doctor?"
LINE 148: asked the major.
LINE 149: "He is very low," replied the young man. "Nothing short of
LINE 150: tracheotomy--an operation to open the windpipe--will relieve him.
LINE 151: Without it, in half or three quarters of an hour he will be unable to
LINE 152: breathe. It is a delicate operation, a mistake in which would be as
LINE 153: fatal as the disease. I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to
LINE 154: attempt it, and your child's life is too valuable for a student to
LINE 155: practice upon. Neither have I the instruments here."
LINE 156: "What shall we do?" demanded Carteret. "We have called all the best
LINE 157: doctors, and none are available."
LINE 158: The young doctor's brow was wrinkled with thought. He knew a doctor who
LINE 159: could perform the operation. He had heard, also, of a certain event at
LINE 160: Carteret's house some months before, when an unwelcome physician had
LINE 161: been excluded from a consultation,--but it was the last chance.
LINE 162: "There is but one other doctor in town who has performed the operation,
LINE 163: so far as I know," he declared, "and that is Dr. Miller. If you can get
LINE 164: him, he can save your child's life."
LINE 165: Carteret hesitated involuntarily. All the incidents, all the arguments,
LINE 166: of the occasion when he had refused to admit the colored doctor to his
LINE 167: house, came up vividly before his memory. He had acted in accordance
LINE 168: with his lifelong beliefs, and had carried his point; but the present
LINE 169: situation was different,--this was a case of imperative necessity, and
LINE 170: every other interest or consideration must give way before the imminence
LINE 171: of his child's peril. That the doctor would refuse the call, he did not
LINE 172: imagine: it would be too great an honor for a negro to decline,--unless
LINE 173: some bitterness might have grown out of the proceedings of the
LINE 174: afternoon. That this doctor was a man of some education he knew; and he
LINE 175: had been told that he was a man of fine feeling,--for a negro,--and
LINE 176: might easily have taken to heart the day's events. Nevertheless, he
LINE 177: could hardly refuse a professional call,--professional ethics would
LINE 178: require him to respond. Carteret had no reason to suppose that Miller
LINE 179: had ever learned of what had occurred at the house during Dr. Burns's
LINE 180: visit to Wellington. The major himself had never mentioned the
LINE 181: controversy, and no doubt the other gentlemen had been equally silent.
LINE 182: "I'll go for him myself," said Dr. Evans, noting Carteret's hesitation
LINE 183: and suspecting its cause. "I can do nothing here alone, for a little
LINE 184: while, and I may be able to bring the doctor back with me. He likes a
LINE 185: difficult operation."
LINE 186: * * * * *
LINE 187: It seemed an age ere the young doctor returned, though it was really
LINE 188: only a few minutes. The nurse did what she could to relieve the child's
LINE 189: sufferings, which grew visibly more and more acute. The mother, upon the
LINE 190: other side of the bed, held one of the baby's hands in her own, and
LINE 191: controlled her feelings as best she might. Carteret paced the floor
LINE 192: anxiously, going every few seconds to the head of the stairs to listen
LINE 193: for Evans's footsteps on the piazza without. At last the welcome sound
LINE 194: was audible, and a few strides took him to the door.
LINE 195: "Dr. Miller is at home, sir," reported Evans, as he came in. "He says
LINE 196: that he was called to your house once before, by a third person who
LINE 197: claimed authority to act, and that he was refused admittance. He
LINE 198: declares that he will not consider such a call unless it come from you
LINE 199: personally."
LINE 200: "That is true, quite true," replied Carteret. "His position is a just
LINE 201: one. I will go at once. Will--will--my child live until I can get Miller
LINE 202: here?"
LINE 203: "He can live for half an hour without an operation. Beyond that I could
LINE 204: give you little hope."
LINE 205: Seizing his hat, Carteret dashed out of the yard and ran rapidly to
LINE 206: Miller's house; ordinarily a walk of six or seven minutes, Carteret
LINE 207: covered it in three, and was almost out of breath when he rang the bell
LINE 208: of Miller's front door.
LINE 209: The ring was answered by the doctor in person.
LINE 210: "Dr. Miller, I believe?" asked Carteret.
LINE 211: "Yes, sir."
LINE 212: "I am Major Carteret. My child is seriously ill, and you are the only
LINE 213: available doctor who can perform the necessary operation."
LINE 214: "Ah! You have tried all the others,--and then you come to me!"
LINE 215: "Yes, I do not deny it," admitted the major, biting his lip. He had not
LINE 216: counted on professional jealousy as an obstacle to be met. "But I _have_
LINE 217: come to you, as a physician, to engage your professional services for my
LINE 218: child,--my only child. I have confidence in your skill, or I should not
LINE 219: have come to you. I request--nay, I implore you to lose no more time,
LINE 220: but come with me at once! My child's life is hanging by a thread, and
LINE 221: you can save it!"
LINE 222: "Ah!" replied the other, "as a father whose only child's life is in
LINE 223: danger, you implore me, of all men in the world, to come and save it!"
LINE 224: There was a strained intensity in the doctor's low voice that struck
LINE 225: Carteret, in spite of his own pre-occupation. He thought he heard, too,
LINE 226: from the adjoining room, the sound of some one sobbing softly. There was
LINE 227: some mystery here which he could not fathom unaided.
LINE 228: Miller turned to the door behind him and threw it open. On the white
LINE 229: cover of a low cot lay a childish form in the rigidity of death, and by
LINE 230: it knelt, with her back to the door, a woman whose shoulders were shaken
LINE 231: by the violence of her sobs. Absorbed in her grief, she did not turn, or
LINE 232: give any sign that she had recognized the intrusion.
LINE 233: "There, Major Carteret!" exclaimed Miller, with the tragic eloquence of
LINE 234: despair, "there lies a specimen of your handiwork! There lies _my_ only
LINE 235: child, laid low by a stray bullet in this riot which you and your paper
LINE 236: have fomented; struck down as much by your hand as though you had held
LINE 237: the weapon with which his life was taken!"
LINE 238: "My God!" exclaimed Carteret, struck with horror. "Is the child dead?"
LINE 239: "There he lies," continued the other, "an innocent child,--there he lies
LINE 240: dead, his little life snuffed out like a candle, because you and a
LINE 241: handful of your friends thought you must override the laws and run this
LINE 242: town at any cost!--and there kneels his mother, overcome by grief. We
LINE 243: are alone in the house. It is not safe to leave her unattended. My duty
LINE 244: calls me here, by the side of my dead child and my suffering wife! I
LINE 245: cannot go with you. There is a just God in heaven!--as you have sown, so
LINE 246: may you reap!"
LINE 247: Carteret possessed a narrow, but a logical mind, and except when
LINE 248: confused or blinded by his prejudices, had always tried to be a just
LINE 249: man. In the agony of his own predicament,--in the horror of the
LINE 250: situation at Miller's house,--for a moment the veil of race prejudice
LINE 251: was rent in twain, and he saw things as they were, in their correct
LINE 252: proportions and relations,--saw clearly and convincingly that he had no
LINE 253: standing here, in the presence of death, in the home of this stricken
LINE 254: family. Miller's refusal to go with him was pure, elemental justice; he
LINE 255: could not blame the doctor for his stand. He was indeed conscious of a
LINE 256: certain involuntary admiration for a man who held in his hands the power
LINE 257: of life and death, and could use it, with strict justice, to avenge his
LINE 258: own wrongs. In Dr. Miller's place he would have done the same thing.
LINE 259: Miller had spoken the truth,--as he had sown, so must he reap! He could
LINE 260: not expect, could not ask, this father to leave his own household at
LINE 261: such a moment.
LINE 262: Pressing his lips together with grim courage, and bowing mechanically,
LINE 263: as though to Fate rather than the physician, Carteret turned and left
LINE 264: the house. At a rapid pace he soon reached home. There was yet a chance
LINE 265: for his child: perhaps some one of the other doctors had come; perhaps,
LINE 266: after all, the disease had taken a favorable turn,--Evans was but a
LINE 267: young doctor, and might have been mistaken. Surely, with doctors all
LINE 268: around him, his child would not be permitted to die for lack of medical
LINE 269: attention! He found the mother, the doctor, and the nurse still grouped,
LINE 270: as he had left them, around the suffering child.
LINE 271: "How is he now?" he asked, in a voice that sounded like a groan.
LINE 272: "No better," replied the doctor; "steadily growing worse. He can go on
LINE 273: probably for twenty minutes longer without an operation."
LINE 274: "Where is the doctor?" demanded Mrs. Carteret, looking eagerly toward
LINE 275: the door. "You should have brought him right upstairs. There's not a
LINE 276: minute to spare! Phil, Phil, our child will die!"
LINE 277: Carteret's heart swelled almost to bursting with an intense pity. Even
LINE 278: his own great sorrow became of secondary importance beside the grief
LINE 279: which his wife must soon feel at the inevitable loss of her only child.
LINE 280: And it was his fault! Would that he could risk his own life to spare her
LINE 281: and to save the child!
LINE 282: Briefly, and as gently as might be, he stated the result of his errand.
LINE 283: The doctor had refused to come, for a good reason. He could not ask him
LINE 284: again.
LINE 285: Young Evans felt the logic of the situation, which Carteret had
LINE 286: explained sufficiently. To the nurse it was even clearer. If she or any
LINE 287: other woman had been in the doctor's place, she would have given the
LINE 288: same answer.
LINE 289: Mrs. Carteret did not stop to reason. In such a crisis a mother's heart
LINE 290: usurps the place of intellect. For her, at that moment, there were but
LINE 291: two facts in all the world. Her child lay dying. There was within the
LINE 292: town, and within reach, a man who could save him. With an agonized cry
LINE 293: she rushed wildly from the room.
LINE 294: Carteret sought to follow her, but she flew down the long stairs like a
LINE 295: wild thing. The least misstep might have precipitated her to the bottom;
LINE 296: but ere Carteret, with a remonstrance on his lips, had scarcely reached
LINE 297: the uppermost step, she had thrown open the front door and fled
LINE 298: precipitately out into the night.
