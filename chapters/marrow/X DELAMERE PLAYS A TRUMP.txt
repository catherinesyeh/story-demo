LINE 1: Carteret did not forget what General Belmont had said in regard to Tom.
LINE 2: The major himself had been young, not so very long ago, and was inclined
LINE 3: toward indulgence for the foibles of youth. A young gentleman should
LINE 4: have a certain knowledge of life,--but there were limits. Clara's future
LINE 5: happiness must not be imperiled.
LINE 6: The opportunity to carry out this purpose was not long delayed. Old Mr.
LINE 7: Delamere wished to sell some timber which had been cut at Belleview, and
LINE 8: sent Tom down to the Chronicle office to leave an advertisement. The
LINE 9: major saw him at the desk, invited him into his sanctum, and delivered
LINE 10: him a mild lecture. The major was kind, and talked in a fatherly way
LINE 11: about the danger of extremes, the beauty of moderation, and the value of
LINE 12: discretion as a rule of conduct. He mentioned collaterally the
LINE 13: unblemished honor of a fine old family, its contemplated alliance with
LINE 14: his own, and dwelt upon the sweet simplicity of Clara's character. The
LINE 15: major was a man of feeling and of tact, and could not have put the
LINE 16: subject in a way less calculated to wound the _amour propre_ of a very
LINE 17: young man.
LINE 18: Delamere had turned red with anger while the major was speaking. He was
LINE 19: impulsive, and an effort was required to keep back the retort that
LINE 20: sprang once or twice to his lips; but his conscience was not clear, and
LINE 21: he could not afford hard words with Clara's guardian and his
LINE 22: grandfather's friend. Clara was rich, and the most beautiful girl in
LINE 23: town; they were engaged; he loved her as well as he could love anything
LINE 24: of which he seemed sure; and he did not mean that any one else should
LINE 25: have her. The major's mild censure disturbed slightly his sense of
LINE 26: security; and while the major's manner did not indicate that he knew
LINE 27: anything definite against him, it would be best to let well enough
LINE 28: alone.
LINE 29: "Thank you, major," he said, with well-simulated frankness. "I realize
LINE 30: that I may have been a little careless, more from thoughtlessness than
LINE 31: anything else; but my heart is all right, sir, and I am glad that my
LINE 32: conduct has been brought to your attention, for what you have said
LINE 33: enables me to see it in a different light. I will be more careful of my
LINE 34: company hereafter; for I love Clara, and mean to try to be worthy of
LINE 35: her. Do you know whether she will be at home this evening?"
LINE 36: "I have heard nothing to the contrary," replied the major warmly. "Call
LINE 37: her up by telephone and ask--or come up and see. You're always welcome,
LINE 38: my boy."
LINE 39: Upon leaving the office, which was on the second floor, Tom met Ellis
LINE 40: coming up the stairs. It had several times of late occurred to Tom that
LINE 41: Ellis had a sneaking fondness for Clara. Panoplied in his own
LINE 42: engagement, Tom had heretofore rather enjoyed the idea of a hopeless
LINE 43: rival. Ellis was such a solemn prig, and took life so seriously, that it
LINE 44: was a pleasure to see him sit around sighing for the unattainable. That
LINE 45: he should be giving pain to Ellis added a certain zest to his own
LINE 46: enjoyment. But this interview with the major had so disquieted him
LINE 47: that upon meeting Ellis upon the stairs he was struck by a sudden
LINE 48: suspicion. He knew that Major Carteret seldom went to the Clarendon
LINE 49: Club, and that he must have got his information from some one else.
LINE 50: Ellis was a member of the club, and a frequent visitor. Who more likely
LINE 51: than he to try to poison Clara's mind, or the minds of her friends,
LINE 52: against her accepted lover? Tom did not think that the world was using
LINE 53: him well of late; bad luck had pursued him, in cards and other things,
LINE 54: and despite his assumption of humility, Carteret's lecture had left him
LINE 55: in an ugly mood. He nodded curtly to Ellis without relaxing the scowl
LINE 56: that disfigured his handsome features.
LINE 57: "That's the damned sneak who's been giving me away," he muttered. "I'll
LINE 58: get even with him yet for this."
LINE 59: Delamere's suspicions with regard to Ellis's feelings were not, as we
LINE 60: have seen, entirely without foundation. Indeed, he had underestimated
LINE 61: the strength of this rivalry and its chances of success. Ellis had been
LINE 62: watching Delamere for a year. There had been nothing surreptitious about
LINE 63: it, but his interest in Clara had led him to note things about his
LINE 64: favored rival which might have escaped the attention of others less
LINE 65: concerned.
LINE 66: Ellis was an excellent judge of character, and had formed a very decided
LINE 67: opinion of Tom Delamere. To Ellis, unbiased by ancestral traditions,
LINE 68: biased perhaps by jealousy, Tom Delamere was a type of the degenerate
LINE 69: aristocrat. If, as he had often heard, it took three or four generations
LINE 70: to make a gentleman, and as many more to complete the curve and return
LINE 71: to the base from which it started, Tom Delamere belonged somewhere on
LINE 72: the downward slant, with large possibilities of further decline. Old
LINE 73: Mr. Delamere, who might be taken as the apex of an ideal aristocratic
LINE 74: development, had been distinguished, during his active life, as Ellis
LINE 75: had learned, for courage and strength of will, courtliness of bearing,
LINE 76: deference to his superiors, of whom there had been few, courtesy to his
LINE 77: equals, kindness and consideration for those less highly favored, and
LINE 78: above all, a scrupulous sense of honor; his grandson Tom was merely the
LINE 79: shadow without the substance, the empty husk without the grain. Of grace
LINE 80: he had plenty. In manners he could be perfect, when he so chose. Courage
LINE 81: and strength he had none. Ellis had seen this fellow, who boasted of his
LINE 82: descent from a line of cavaliers, turn pale with fright and spring from
LINE 83: a buggy to which was harnessed a fractious horse, which a negro
LINE 84: stable-boy drove fearlessly. A valiant carpet-knight, skilled in all
LINE 85: parlor exercises, great at whist or euchre, a dream of a dancer,
LINE 86: unexcelled in Cakewalk or "coon" impersonations, for which he was in
LINE 87: large social demand, Ellis had seen him kick an inoffensive negro out of
LINE 88: his path and treat a poor-white man with scant courtesy. He suspected
LINE 89: Delamere of cheating at cards, and knew that others entertained the same
LINE 90: suspicion. For while regular in his own habits,--his poverty would not
LINE 91: have permitted him any considerable extravagance,--Ellis's position as a
LINE 92: newspaper man kept him in touch with what was going on about town. He
LINE 93: was a member, proposed by Carteret, of the Clarendon Club, where cards
LINE 94: were indulged in within reasonable limits, and a certain set were known
LINE 95: to bet dollars in terms of dimes.
LINE 96: Delamere was careless, too, about money matters. He had a habit of
LINE 97: borrowing, right and left, small sums which might be conveniently
LINE 98: forgotten by the borrower, and for which the lender would dislike to
LINE 99: ask. Ellis had a strain of thrift, derived from a Scotch ancestry, and a
LINE 100: tenacious memory for financial details. Indeed, he had never had so much
LINE 101: money that he could lose track of it. He never saw Delamere without
LINE 102: being distinctly conscious that Delamere owed him four dollars, which he
LINE 103: had lent at a time when he could ill afford to spare it. It was a
LINE 104: prerogative of aristocracy, Ellis reflected, to live upon others, and
LINE 105: the last privilege which aristocracy in decay would willingly
LINE 106: relinquish. Neither did the aristocratic memory seem able to retain the
LINE 107: sordid details of a small pecuniary transaction.
LINE 108: No doubt the knowledge that Delamere was the favored lover of Miss
LINE 109: Pemberton lent a touch of bitterness to Ellis's reflections upon his
LINE 110: rival. Ellis had no grievance against the "aristocracy" of Wellington.
LINE 111: The "best people" had received him cordially, though his father had not
LINE 112: been of their caste; but Ellis hated a hypocrite, and despised a coward,
LINE 113: and he felt sure that Delamere was both. Otherwise he would have
LINE 114: struggled against his love for Clara Pemberton. His passion for her had
LINE 115: grown with his appreciation of Delamere's unworthiness. As a friend of
LINE 116: the family, he knew the nature and terms of the engagement, and that if
LINE 117: the marriage took place at all, it would not be for at least a year.
LINE 118: This was a long time,--many things might happen in a year, especially to
LINE 119: a man like Tom Delamere. If for any reason Delamere lost his chance,
LINE 120: Ellis meant to be next in the field. He had not made love to Clara, but
LINE 121: he had missed no opportunity of meeting her and making himself quietly
LINE 122: and unobtrusively agreeable.
LINE 123: On the day after this encounter with Delamere on the stairs of the
LINE 124: Chronicle office, Ellis, while walking down Vine Street, met old Mrs.
LINE 125: Ochiltree. She was seated in her own buggy, which was of ancient build
LINE 126: and pattern, driven by her colored coachman and man of all work.
LINE 127: "Mr. Ellis," she called in a shrill voice, having directed her coachman
LINE 128: to draw up at the curb as she saw the young man approaching, "come here.
LINE 129: I want to speak to you."
LINE 130: Ellis came up to the buggy and stood uncovered beside it.
LINE 131: "People are saying," said Mrs. Ochiltree, "that Tom Delamere is drinking
LINE 132: hard, and has to be carried home intoxicated, two or three times a week,
LINE 133: by old Mr. Delamere's man Sandy. Is there any truth in the story?"
LINE 134: "My dear Mrs. Ochiltree, I am not Tom Delamere's keeper. Sandy could
LINE 135: tell you better than I."
LINE 136: "You are dodging my question, Mr. Ellis. Sandy wouldn't tell me the
LINE 137: truth, and I know that you wouldn't lie,--you don't look like a liar.
LINE 138: They say Tom is gambling scandalously. What do you know about that?"
LINE 139: "You must excuse me, Mrs. Ochiltree. A great deal of what we hear is
LINE 140: mere idle gossip, and the truth is often grossly exaggerated. I'm a
LINE 141: member of the same club with Delamere, and gentlemen who belong to the
LINE 142: same club are not in the habit of talking about one another. As long as
LINE 143: a man retains his club membership, he's presumed to be a gentleman. I
LINE 144: wouldn't say anything against Delamere if I could."
LINE 145: "You don't need to," replied the old lady, shaking her finger at him
LINE 146: with a cunning smile. "You are a very open young man, Mr. Ellis, and I
LINE 147: can read you like a book. You are much smarter than you look, but you
LINE 148: can't fool me. Good-morning."
LINE 149: Mrs. Ochiltree drove immediately to her niece's, where she found Mrs.
LINE 150: Carteret and Clara at home. Clara was very fond of the baby, and was
LINE 151: holding him in her arms. He was a fine baby, and bade fair to realize
LINE 152: the bright hopes built upon him.
LINE 153: "You hold a baby very naturally, Clara," chuckled the old lady. "I
LINE 154: suppose you are in training. But you ought to talk to Tom. I have just
LINE 155: learned from Mr. Ellis that Tom is carried home drunk two or three times
LINE 156: a week, and that he is gambling in the most reckless manner imaginable."
LINE 157: Clara's eyes flashed indignantly. Ere she could speak, Mrs. Carteret
LINE 158: exclaimed:--
LINE 159: "Why, Aunt Polly! did Mr. Ellis say that?"
LINE 160: "I got it from Dinah," she replied, "who heard it from her husband, who
LINE 161: learned it from a waiter at the club. And"--
LINE 162: "Pshaw!" said Mrs. Carteret, "mere servants' gossip."
LINE 163: "No, it isn't, Olivia. I met Mr. Ellis on the street, and asked him
LINE 164: point blank, and he didn't deny it. He's a member of the club, and
LINE 165: ought to know."
LINE 166: "Well, Aunt Polly, it can't be true. Tom is here every other night, and
LINE 167: how could he carry on so without showing the signs of it? and where
LINE 168: would he get the money? You know he has only a moderate allowance."
LINE 169: "He may win it at cards,--it's better to be born lucky than rich,"
LINE 170: returned Mrs. Ochiltree. "Then he has expectations, and can get credit.
LINE 171: There's no doubt that Tom is going on shamefully." Clara's
LINE 172: indignation had not yet found vent in speech; Olivia had said all that
LINE 173: was necessary, but she had been thinking rapidly. Even if all this had
LINE 174: been true, why should Mr. Ellis have said it? Or, if he had not stated
LINE 175: it directly, he had left the inference to be drawn. It seemed a most
LINE 176: unfair and ungentlemanly thing. What motive could Ellis have for such an
LINE 177: act?
LINE 178: She was not long in reaching a conclusion which was not flattering to
LINE 179: Ellis. Mr. Ellis came often to the house, and she had enjoyed his
LINE 180: society in a friendly way. That he had found her pleasant company had
LINE 181: been very evident. She had never taken his attentions seriously,
LINE 182: however, or regarded his visits as made especially to her, nor had the
LINE 183: rest of the family treated them from that point of view. Her engagement
LINE 184: to Tom Delamere, though not yet formally ratified, was so well
LINE 185: understood by the world of Wellington that Mr. Ellis would, scarcely
LINE 186: have presumed to think of her as anything more than a friend.
LINE 187: This revelation of her aunt's, however, put a different face upon his
LINE 188: conduct. Certain looks and sighs and enigmatical remarks of Ellis, to
LINE 189: which she had paid but casual attention and attached no particular
LINE 190: significance, now recurred to her memory with a new meaning. He had now
LINE 191: evidently tried, in a roundabout way, to besmirch Tom's character and
LINE 192: undermine him in her regard. While loving Tom, she had liked Ellis well
LINE 193: enough, as a friend; but he had abused the privileges of friendship, and
LINE 194: she would teach him a needed lesson.
LINE 195: Nevertheless, Mrs. Ochiltree's story had given Clara food for thought.
LINE 196: She was uneasily conscious, after all, that there might be a grain of
LINE 197: truth in what had been said, enough, at least, to justify her in
LINE 198: warning Tom to be careful, lest his enemies should distort some amiable
LINE 199: weakness into a serious crime.
LINE 200: She put this view of the case to Tom at their next meeting, assuring
LINE 201: him, at the same time, of her unbounded faith and confidence. She did
LINE 202: not mention Ellis's name, lest Tom, in righteous indignation, might do
LINE 203: something rash, which he might thereafter regret. If any subtler or more
LINE 204: obscure motive kept her silent as to Ellis, she was not aware of it; for
LINE 205: Clara's views of life were still in the objective stage, and she had not
LINE 206: yet fathomed the deepest recesses of her own consciousness.
LINE 207: Delamere had the cunning of weakness. He knew, too, better than any one
LINE 208: else could know, how much truth there was in the rumors concerning him,
LINE 209: and whether or not they could be verified too easily for him to make an
LINE 210: indignant denial. After a little rapid reflection, he decided upon a
LINE 211: different course.
LINE 212: "Clara," he said with a sigh, taking the hand which she generously
LINE 213: yielded to soften any suggestion of reproach which he may have read into
LINE 214: her solicitude, "you are my guardian angel. I do not know, of course,
LINE 215: who has told you this pack of lies,--for I can see that you have heard
LINE 216: more than you have told me,--but I think I could guess the man they came
LINE 217: from. I am not perfect, Clara, though I have done nothing of which a
LINE 218: gentleman should be ashamed. There is one sure way to stop the tongue of
LINE 219: calumny. My home life is not ideal,--grandfather is an old, weak man,
LINE 220: and the house needs the refining and softening influence of a lady's
LINE 221: presence. I do not love club life; its ideals are not elevating. With
LINE 222: you by my side, dearest, I should be preserved from every influence
LINE 223: except the purest and the best. Don't you think, dearest, that the major
LINE 224: might be induced to shorten our weary term of waiting?"
LINE 225: "Oh, Tom," she demurred blushingly, "I shall be young enough at
LINE 226: eighteen; and you are barely twenty-one."
LINE 227: But Tom proved an eloquent pleader, and love a still more persuasive
LINE 228: advocate. Clara spoke to the major the same evening, who looked grave at
LINE 229: the suggestion, and said he would think about it. They were both very
LINE 230: young; but where both parties were of good family, in good health and
LINE 231: good circumstances, an early marriage might not be undesirable. Tom was
LINE 232: perhaps a little unsettled, but blood would tell in the long run, and
LINE 233: marriage always exercised a steadying influence.
LINE 234: The only return, therefore, which Ellis received for his well-meant
LINE 235: effort to ward off Mrs. Ochiltree's embarrassing inquiries was that he
LINE 236: did not see Clara upon his next visit, which was made one afternoon
LINE 237: while he was on night duty at the office. In conversation with Mrs.
LINE 238: Carteret he learned that Clara's marriage had been definitely agreed
LINE 239: upon, and the date fixed,--it was to take place in about six months.
LINE 240: Meeting Miss Pemberton on the street the following day, he received the
LINE 241: slightest of nods. When he called again at the house, after a week of
LINE 242: misery, she treated him with a sarcastic coolness which chilled his
LINE 243: heart.
LINE 244: "How have I offended you, Miss Clara?" he demanded desperately, when
LINE 245: they were left alone for a moment.
LINE 246: "Offended me?" she replied, lifting her eyebrows with an air of puzzled
LINE 247: surprise. "Why, Mr. Ellis! What could have put such a notion into your
LINE 248: head? Oh dear, I think I hear Dodie,--I know you'll excuse me, Mr.
LINE 249: Ellis, won't you? Sister Olivia will be back in a moment; and we're
LINE 250: expecting Aunt Polly this afternoon,--if you'll stay awhile she'll be
LINE 251: glad to talk to you! You can tell her all the interesting news about
LINE 252: your friends!"
