LINE 1: Chapter Five
LINE 2: Memories
LINE 3: Falling forever.
LINE 4: Or maybe rising.
LINE 5: In the midst of this indistinct floating sensation, the comet shines in the night
LINE 6: sky.
LINE 7: Without warning, it splits, and half of it comes plummeting down.
LINE 8: The meteorite strikes a village in the mountains. Many people die. A lake
LINE 9: forms, and the village is destroyed.
LINE 10: Time passes, and another village grows up around the lake. The lake
LINE 11: provides fish, and the heavenly iron provides wealth. The village prospers.
LINE 12: Ages pass, and the comet arrives again. Once again, the star falls. Once again,
LINE 13: people die.
LINE 14: This has happened twice since mankind settled on these islands.
LINE 15: People tried to remember it. They tried to pass on the knowledge to future
LINE 16: generations, using methods that would last longer than letters. The comet as a
LINE 17: dragon. The comet as braided cords. The fracturing comet as the gestures of a
LINE 18: dance.
LINE 19: Once again, ages pass.
LINE 20: I hear a baby crying.
LINE 21: "Your name is Mitsuha."
LINE 22: A mother's gentle voice.
LINE 23: Then, with a brutal sensation, the umbilical cord is cut.
LINE 24: Even though we were all two who lived as one in the beginning, even
LINE 25: though we were all connected, so humans are severed from the cord and fall
LINE 26: into this life.
LINE 27: "You're both your dad's treasures."
LINE 28: "You're a big sister now, sweetheart."
LINE 29: A young couple converses. Before long, Mitsuha's little sister is born. As if
LINE 30: in exchange for that joy, her mother falls ill.
LINE 31: "When is Mommy cornin' back from the hospital?"
LINE 32: The little sister's question is innocent, but the older sister knows their
LINE 33: mother is never coming back. Everyone dies. It's inevitable, but it isn't easy to
LINE 34: accept.
LINE 35: "They couldn't save her!"
LINE 36: The father grieves deeply. He has never loved anyone as much as he loved
LINE 37: his wife, and he never will again. It's both a blessing and a curse that, as they
LINE 38: grow, his daughters look more and more like their mother.
LINE 39: "Taking over the shrine won't do anyâ€”"
LINE 40: "What are you saying?! Why do you think we formally adopted you when
LINE 41: you married?!"
LINE 42: The father and grandmother quarrel more every day.
LINE 43: "I loved Futaba, not Miyamizu Shrine."
LINE 44: "Get out!"
LINE 45: Both the father and the grandmother are too old to change their priorities.
LINE 46: The father can't take it, and he leaves.
LINE 47: "Mitsuha, Yotsuha. From now on, you'll be with your gran all the time."
LINE 48: In a house that echoes with the click of ball-weights, the three women begin
LINE 49: their life together.
LINE 50: The days are peaceful enough. Even so, the feeling that her father has
LINE 51: abandoned her becomes an indelible stain inside Mitsuha.
LINE 52: These are...
LINE 53: .. .Mitsuha's memories?
LINE 54: As if I'm being swept along helplessly by a storm-swollen torrent, I
LINE 55: experience Mitsuha's time.
LINE 56: Then come the days I already know, the swapped days.
LINE 57: Seen through Mitsuha's eyes, Tokyo shines like an exotic foreign country.
LINE 58: Even though we share the same senses, it's as if we're seeing completely
LINE 59: different worlds.
LINE 60: "Lucky..."
LINE 61: I hear Mitsuha murmur.
LINE 62: "I bet they're together right about now."
LINE 63: It's the day of my date with Okudera-senpai.
LINE 64: 'Tmgoin' to Tokyo for a bit," she tells her little sister.
LINE 65: Tokyo?
LINE 66: That night, Mitsuha opens the sliding door to her grandmother's room.
LINE 67: "Gran, can I ask a favor...?"
LINE 68: Mitsuha's long hair is chopped short. She isn't the Mitsuha I know
LINE 69: anymore.
LINE 70: "They say it'll look brightest tonight."
LINE 71: Teshigawara and the others invite her out. Let s go watch the comet.
LINE 72: Mitsuha, don't! I scream
LINE 73: From behind the mirror. In the peal of the wind chimes. As the wind that
LINE 74: stirs her hair.
LINE 75: Mitsuha, no, you can't go there!
LINE 76: Run! Get out of town before the comet falls!
LINE 77: But my voice doesn't reach her. She doesn't notice me.
LINE 78: On the night of the festival, Mitsuha and her friends look up at the comet,
LINE 79: now closer than the moon.
LINE 80: The comet suddenly splits, and its shards shine, becoming countless
LINE 81: shooting stars. One massive fragment of rock becomes a meteor and begins to
LINE 82: fall.
LINE 83: Even then, gazing at it, her only thought is, It's beautiful.
LINE 84: Mitsuha, run!
LINE 85: I scream at the top of my lungs.
LINE 86: Mitsuha, run, please run! Mitsuha, Mitsuha, Mitsuha!
LINE 87: And the star falls.
