LINE 1: Chapter Two
LINE 2: The Beginning
LINE 3: I don't recognize that ringtone , I think drowsily.
LINE 4: An alarm? But I'm still sleepy. I was in the zone drawing last night and
LINE 5: didn't get to bed until it was almost dawn.
LINE 6: "...ki... Taki."
LINE 7: Now somebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.A girl?
LINE 8: "Taki, Taki."
LINE 9: Her voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
LINE 10: with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
LINE 11: "Don't you remember me?" the voice asks me anxiously.
LINE 12: No, I don't know you.
LINE 13: Suddenly, the train stops, and the doors open. Oh, right—I was on a train.
LINE 14: The moment I realize this, I'm standing in a packed train car. A pair of wide
LINE 15: eyes hovers right in front of me. A girl in a uniform is staring straight at me, but
LINE 16: the press of disembarking passengers is pushing her farther away.
LINE 17: "My name is Mitsuha!"
LINE 18: The girl shouts, undoing the cord she'd used to tie back her hair and holding
LINE 19: it out to me. Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray
LINE 20: of evening sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that
LINE 21: color tight.
LINE 22: At that point, my eyes open.
LINE 23: The girl's voice—its echoes—still whispers in my ears.
LINE 24: .. .Her name is Mitsuha?
LINE 25: I don't know the name, and I don't know the girl. She looked really
LINE 26: desperate somehow. Her eyes were brimming with tears. I'd never seen the
LINE 27: style of uniform she was wearing. Her expression was serious, even grave, as
LINE 28: if the fate of the universe rested in her hands.
LINE 29: Still, it was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. By the time I think about
LINE 30: it, I can't even remember her face. The echoes in my ears are already gone,
LINE 31: too.
LINE 32: Even so.
LINE 33: Even so, my pulse is still racing abnormally fast. My chest is weirdly
LINE 34: heavy. I'm sweaty all over. For the moment, I draw a deep breath.
LINE 35: Haaaah...
LINE 36: Do I have a cold? My nose and throat feel funny. My airways are a little
LINE 37: tighter than usual. My chest...really is weirdly heavy. How do I put this?
LINE 38: Physically heavy. I look down at my body and see cleavage.
LINE 39: Cleavage.
LINE 40: The soft mounds reflect the morning sun, and the pale, smooth skin gleams.
LINE 41: A deep-blue shadow lies between the two breasts, like a lake.
LINE 42: Might as well squeeze 'em , I think, without missing a beat.
LINE 43: My hands gravitate toward them as naturally as an apple falling to the
LINE 44: ground.
LINE 45: . ?
LINE 46: ...!
LINE 47: The sensation blows my mind. Whoa, I think. What is this? I keep kneading
LINE 48: earnestly. This is just... Wow... Girls' bodies are amazing...
LINE 49: "Sis? What're you doin'?"
LINE 50: I glance in the direction of the voice. There's a little girl standing there.
LINE 51: She's just opened a sliding door. With my hands still pressed against my chest,
LINE 52: I give her my honest impression.
LINE 53: "I was just thinking these feel way real... Huh?"
LINE 54: I look at the kid again. She's about ten, with twin ponytails and sharp eyes,
LINE 55: and she looks like the sassy type.
LINE 56: .. 'Sis'?" I ask the girl, pointing at myself.
LINE 57: So that means this is my kid sister? The girl looks thoroughly appalled.
LINE 58: "You still asleep or somethin'? It's. Break. Fast. Time! Hurry up!"
LINE 59: She slams the sliding door shut with a sharp thwack. Fierce little girl, I
LINE 60: think, hauling myself off the futon. Come to think of it, I am hungry. Suddenly, a
LINE 61: full-length mirror in the corner of my vision catches my eye. I walk a few steps
LINE 62: across the tatami mats decorating the floor to stand in front of it. Letting my
LINE 63: loose nightshirt slip off my shoulders and fall to the floor leaves me naked. I
LINE 64: stare at my full-length reflection in the mirror.
LINE 65: Long black hair flows down my back, although it's sleep-tousled and
LINE 66: sticking up in places. A small, round face holds big, curious eyes and lips that
LINE 67: seem vaguely amused above a slim neck, deep collarbone, and a swelling
LINE 68: bosom that seems to proclaim, Why yes, thank you, Fm quite healthy! Below
LINE 69: are faint shadows of ribs, and then the soft curves of the waist.
LINE 70: I haven't seen one in the flesh yet, but this is definitely a girl's body.
LINE 71: ...A girl?
LINE 72: I'm...a girl?
LINE 73: Abruptly, the drowsy fog enveloping my body is gone. My head clears
LINE 74: instantly, then plunges into confusion.
LINE 75: I can't take it, and I scream.
LINE 76: + + +
LINE 77: "Sis, you're so late!"
LINE 78: As I open the sliding door and step into the living room, Yotsuha's
LINE 79: accusation flies to greet me.
LINE 80: "I'll fix breakfast tomorrow!" I say by way of apology.
LINE 81: This kid hasn't even lost all her baby teeth yet, but she seems convinced
LINE 82: she's handling life better than her big sister. I can't show weakness by
LINE 83: apologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white
LINE 84: helping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.
LINE 85: "Thanks for the food!"
LINE 86: I pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,
LINE 87: and put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel
LINE 88: eyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.
LINE 89: "So you're normal today, are you?"
LINE 90: "Huh?"
LINE 91: Gran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.
LINE 92: "She sure was somethin' else yesterday!" Yotsuha smirks at me. "Screamin'
LINE 93: all of a sudden like that."
LINE 94: Screaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,
LINE 95: I'm sure).
LINE 96: "Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!"
LINE 97: Seriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.
LINE 98: Ding-dong-ding-do oong.
LINE 99: Suddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.
LINE 100: "Good morning, everyone."
LINE 101: The voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the
LINE 102: Regional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a
LINE 103: dinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either
LINE 104: know each other or at least know someone in common.
LINE 105: "Here are the morning announcements from Itomori."
LINE 106: The slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. "Here
LINE 107: are...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori." There are speakers
LINE 108: outside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and
LINE 109: overlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.
LINE 110: Twice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast
LINE 111: plays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the
LINE 112: daily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how
LINE 113: to contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,
LINE 114: today's funerals.
LINE 115: "With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on
LINE 116: the twentieth of next month, the town election management committee
LINE 117: has—"
LINE 118: Click.
LINE 119: The speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's
LINE 120: pulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but
LINE 121: even so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by
LINE 122: her chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.
LINE 123: Picking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts
LINE 124: speaking.
LINE 125: "We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only
LINE 126: once every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be
LINE 127: visible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the
LINE 128: corner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation
LINE 129: to study it."
LINE 130: There's a line of text on the screen —Comet Tiamat visible to the naked
LINE 131: eye next month —and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its
LINE 132: momentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and
LINE 133: the NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like
LINE 134: whispered chatter during class.
LINE 135: "... Just make up with him already, wouldja?"
LINE 136: Out of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.
LINE 137: "It's an adult problem," I snap at her.
LINE 138: That's right—this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the
LINE 139: wind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.
LINE 140: Saying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.
LINE 141: The summer copper pheasants are crowing up a storm.
LINE 142: Traveling down the narrow paved path that runs along the hillside and
LINE 143: descending several stone-walled stairways, we emerge from the shadow of the
LINE 144: mountain into direct sunlight. Below us is a round lake, Itomori Lake. Its calm
LINE 145: surface reflects the morning sun, glittering and glaring as though nobody's
LINE 146: watching. The deep-green mountains form their ranks under white clouds in a
LINE 147: blue sky, and a little girl with pigtails and a red school backpack skips along
LINE 148: for no reason. Then there's me beside her, the dazzling, bare-legged high
LINE 149: school girl. In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as
LINE 150: background music. Ooh, it's just like the opening of a Japanese film... In other
LINE 151: words, we live in the boonies—very Japanese and a few decades behind the
LINE 152: times.
LINE 153: "Miiitsuhaaa!"
LINE 154: After Yotsuha and I part ways in front of the elementary school, a voice
LINE 155: calls out from behind me. It's Tesshi, pedaling his bike and looking cranky,
LINE 156: with Saya seated primly on the bike rack and smiling.
LINE 157: "Hurry up and get off," Tesshi grumbles.
LINE 158: "I'm fine right here. Don't be stingy!"
LINE 159: "C'mon, you're heavy."
LINE 160: "And you're rude!"
LINE 161: This early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a
LINE 162: married couple in a comedy skit.
LINE 163: "You two get along so well."
LINE 164: "We do not!" they chorus.
LINE 165: They deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack
LINE 166: switches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a
LINE 167: good ten years—petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and
LINE 168: tall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look
LINE 169: like they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly
LINE 170: synced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.
LINE 171: "Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today."
LINE 172: Saya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,
LINE 173: grinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied
LINE 174: together in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.
LINE 175: "Huh? What about my hair?"
LINE 176: Her comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in
LINE 177: the shuffle at breakfast. I did it "properly" today—does that mean it was weird
LINE 178: yesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking
LINE 179: concerned. "Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?"
LINE 180: "Exorcise?"
LINE 181: "Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!"
LINE 182: ".. .Excuse me?" I frown at the unexpected remark.
LINE 183: Saya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. "Would you quit blamin'
LINE 184: everythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.
LINE 185: Right?"
LINE 186: Stressed?
LINE 187: "Huh? Wait, hold it—what's all this about?"
LINE 188: Why is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't
LINE 189: remember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.
LINE 190: ...Hmm?
LINE 191: Wait, was it really? Yesterday, I...
LINE 192: "—And most importantly!"
LINE 193: A deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.
LINE 194: On the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little
LINE 195: crowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal
LINE 196: parking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and
LINE 197: bolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit
LINE 198: jacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent—Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for
LINE 199: the mayoral election.
LINE 200: "Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the
LINE 201: village restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we
LINE 202: be able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I
LINE 203: intend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it
LINE 204: through to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,
LINE 205: creating a local society in which everyone—from our children to our senior
LINE 206: citizens—can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my
LINE 207: resolve to make this vision my goal..."
LINE 208: It's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold—
LINE 209: this campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot
LINE 210: surrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd— "You know it's
LINE 211: gonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, " "It sounds like he s been
LINE 212: spreadin ' lots of cash around" —make my mood even darker.
LINE 213: "Hey, Miyamizu."
LINE 214: "...Mornin'."
LINE 215: Wonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.
LINE 216: Even in high school, they're part of the flashy "in-crowd," and they snark at us
LINE 217: —the "drones"—over every little thing.
LINE 218: "The mayor and the contractor," one of them says, shooting a deliberate
LINE 219: glance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next
LINE 220: to mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an
LINE 221: armband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.
LINE 222: The guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. "Their kids are all
LINE 223: buddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?"
LINE 224: This is so stupid. I don't even answer—I walk faster, trying to get out of
LINE 225: there. Tesshi's expressionless. Only Saya looks bothered and a bit flustered.
LINE 226: "Mitsuha!"
LINE 227: Suddenly, a loud voice booms out. Yeep! My breath catches in my throat. I
LINE 228: don't believe this. My dad lowered his mic midspeech to shout at me without
LINE 229: the aid of electronic amplification. The whole crowd turns to look at me.
LINE 230: "Mitsuha, straighten up!"
LINE 231: I turn beet red. It's so unfair that I almost start crying. I want to run, but I
LINE 232: desperately fight back the urge and stride away instead.
LINE 233: The crowd is whispering. "He's even tough on family."
LINE 234: "That's the mayor for you."
LINE 235: I hear my classmates snickering. "Ooh. Harsh."
LINE 236: "I kinda feel a little sorry for her."
LINE 237: This could not be worse.
LINE 238: The background music that was playing in my head a minute ago has
LINE 239: disappeared, and I remember that this town, without a soundtrack, is an
LINE 240: absolutely suffocating place.
LINE 241: With a sharp tak, tak, tak, the teacher writes a short poem on the blackboard.
LINE 242: Please don't ask me "Who goes there?" I'm waiting
LINE 243: here for my love, in the September dew.
LINE 244: "Tasokare , 'who goes there?' This is the origin of the term tasogare, or
LINE 245: twilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?"
LINE 246: Speaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big
LINE 247: letters on the blackboard.
LINE 248: "It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,
LINE 249: making it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that
LINE 250: isn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has
LINE 251: another name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had
LINE 252: other names."
LINE 253: Miss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just
LINE 254: shuffling around the same letters.
LINE 255: "'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl "
LINE 256: Somebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of
LINE 257: course, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was
LINE 258: little is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,
LINE 259: our classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school
LINE 260: like this.
LINE 261: "I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori
LINE 262: still use ancient Japanese words here and there."
LINE 263: "'Cause this here's the sticks," proclaims one of the boys, and people start
LINE 264: giggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to
LINE 265: ask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were
LINE 266: abandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly
LINE 267: pondering, I flip through my notebook, and then—on a page that should be
LINE 268: blank—I see something written in big letters:
LINE 269: Who are you?
LINE 270: ...Huh?
LINE 271: What is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being
LINE 272: absorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my
LINE 273: notebook to anybody, either. What? "Who am I?" What's that supposed to
LINE 274: mean?
LINE 275: "...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!"
LINE 276: "Oh! Yes'm!" I stand up hastily.
LINE 277: "Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please," Miss Yuki tells me.
LINE 278: Scrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, "Good to see that you
LINE 279: remember your name today, Miss Miyamizu."
LINE 280: At that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is
LINE 281: going on?!
LINE 282: "You don't remember?"
LINE 283: "...No."
LINE 284: "For real?"
LINE 285: "Yes, for real," I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's
LINE 286: looking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.
LINE 287: ".. .No, listen. Yesterday, you forgot where your desk and your locker were.
LINE 288: Your hair was all mussed and cowlicky, and you hadn't tied it back. You didn't
LINE 289: wear your uniform ribbon, and you were crabby the whole time."
LINE 290: I try visualizing what that must've looked like.What?
LINE 291: "What?! No way, are you serious?!"
LINE 292: "Yeah, you acted like you had amnesia or somethin' yesterday."
LINE 293: Flustered, I try to think back... Something really is off here. I can't
LINE 294: remember yesterday. Or, no—I do remember little bits and pieces.
LINE 295: There was.. .an unfamiliar town somewhere?
LINE 296: A reflection in a mirror.. .a boy?
LINE 297: I try to retrace my memories. Piihyororooo. In the distance, a kite mocks
LINE 298: me. It's lunchtime, and we're chatting in a corner of the schoolyard, juice
LINE 299: boxes in hand.
LINE 300: "Umrn... It feels like I spent the whole day in this weird dream. Like...a
LINE 301: dream about somebody else's life? .. .Mm, I can't remember much of it..."
LINE 302: "I got it!"
LINE 303: Tesshi shouts all of a sudden, and I jump. He snatches up his half-read issue
LINE 304: of the occult magazine MU and shoves it under our noses, spit flying
LINE 305: enthusiastically.
LINE 306: "Memories of your past life! That's what that is! Yeah, I know you're gonna
LINE 307: say that ain't scientific, but if you put it another way and say your unconscious
LINE 308: mind got linked up with a multi verse based on Everett's many-worlds
LINE 309: interpretation—"
LINE 310: "You shut your piehole," Saya scolds him sharply.
LINE 311: "Hey! Were you the one who scribbled in my notebook?!" I erupt at almost
LINE 312: the same time.
LINE 313: "Huh? Scribbled?"
LINE 314: Oh, I guess not. Tesshi's not the type to pull a lame prank like that, and he
LINE 315: didn't have a motive, either.
LINE 316: "Um, nothin'. Never mind," I say, backing down.
LINE 317: "Say what? Whaddaya mean, 'scribbled'? Ami a suspect for somethin'?"
LINE 318: "I told you, forget it."
LINE 319: "Whoa, Mitsuha, you're so mean! Did you hear that, Saya? I've been
LINE 320: falsely accused! Framed! Call a prosecutor, gimme a prosecutor! Or wait,
LINE 321: maybe that's a lawyer. Hey, which one are you supposed to get for stuff like
LINE 322: this?"
LINE 323: "Anyway, Mitsuha, you really were kinda funny yesterday," Saya says,
LINE 324: grandly ignoring Tesshi's complaints. "Were you feelin' sick?"
LINE 325: "Hmm... That's so weird. Maybe I really am stressed..."
LINE 326: I think back on all the accounts I've gotten so far.
LINE 327: Tesshi's already absorbed in his magazine again, as if nothing ever
LINE 328: happened. That's one of his virtues, the way he just lets stuff go.
LINE 329: "That's gotta be it! You've had all kinds of stress lately!"
LINE 330: She's right. Even setting aside the election, that ritual's tonight! Why, oh
LINE 331: why, in this tiny little town, do I have to have a father who's the mayor and a
LINE 332: grandmother who's the chief Shinto priestess at the shrine? I bury my face in
LINE 333: my knees and heave a deep, deep sigh.
LINE 334: "Aaagh... I wanna hurry up and graduate and go to Tokyo. This town is too
LINE 335: cramped and too tight!"
LINE 336: Saya's nodding along: I know. I totally, totally get it! "My mom and my
LINE 337: sisters have all been in charge of the town broadcasts, one after another. Ever
LINE 338: since I was tiny, the neighborhood ladies have called me 'the little broadcast
LINE 339: girl,' you know?! And now I'm in the broadcastin' club for some reason! Even
LINE 340: I don't know what I want to do anymore!"
LINE 341: "Saya, once we graduate, let's get out and go to Tokyo together! Even when
LINE 342: we're grown up, in this town, we'll still be stuck with the school hierarchy!
LINE 343: We'll never be free of these moldy old traditions! C'mon, Tesshi, you're
LINE 344: cornin' with us, right?"
LINE 345: "Hmm?" Absently, Tesshi looks up from his magazine.
LINE 346: ".. .Were you even listenin'?"
LINE 347: "Mm. I don't really, uh... I think I'll just live here for the rest of my life."
LINE 348: HAAAAAAAAH. Saya and I sigh again. This is why he isn't popular with
LINE 349: girls... Although it's not like I've ever had a boyfriend myself.
LINE 350: The wind whispers gently. When I turn to look after it, there's Itomori Lake
LINE 351: below us: placid, calm, and completely disinterested.
LINE 352: This town doesn't have a bookstore or a dentist. There's one train every
LINE 353: two hours, buses come through only twice each day, we don't get weather
LINE 354: reports for our area, and we're still a mosaic on the Google Maps satellite
LINE 355: photos. The convenience store closes at nine, and it sells things like vegetable
LINE 356: seeds and high-grade farming equipment.
LINE 357: On the way home from school, Saya and I are still in "griping about
LINE 358: Itomori" mode.
LINE 359: There are no big chains like McDonald's or MOS Burger, but we have two
LINE 360: sleazy "snackbars." There's no work, no girls come here to find husbands, and
LINE 361: the daylight hours are short. Gripe, gripe, gripe, gripe. Most of the time, we
LINE 362: actually find the town's sparse population refreshing. We're almost proud of it,
LINE 363: but today we despair in earnest.
LINE 364: Tesshi's been pushing his bike along after us, off in his own world, and he
LINE 365: irritably cuts into the conversation.
LINE 366: "Geez, y'all!"
LINE 367: "What?" we ask crossly, and Tesshi gives a creepy grin.
LINE 368: "Forget about all that stuff. Wanna stop at the cafe?"
LINE 369: "Huh...?"
LINE 370: "Wha...?"
LINE 371: "Wha...?!"
LINE 372: "A cafe?!" we chorus in perfect unison.
LINE 373: A metallic kachonk! melts into the calls of the evening cicadas. "Here."
LINE 374: Tesshi holds out the cans of juice from the vending machine. With a motorized
LINE 375: whine, an old man riding his electric scooter home from the fields crosses in
LINE 376: front of us, and a passing stray dog sits down and yawns as if to say, Yeah, why
LINE 377: not? I'll keep you company.
LINE 378: The "cafe" wasn't exactly what springs to mind. It wasn't Starbucks or
LINE 379: Tully's or one of those fantastic, fabled spaces that serves pancakes and bagels
LINE 380: and gelato. It was just a neighborhood bus stop out in the middle of nowhere
LINE 381: with a vending machine and a bench with an ice-cream sign from about thirty
LINE 382: years ago plastered to it. The three of us sit side by side on the bench, sipping
LINE 383: our juice, while the dog rests at our feet. We don't feel like Tesshi tricked us.
LINE 384: It's more like, Well, sure. What else would it be?
LINE 385: "Okay, I'm headin' home."
LINE 386: I bid my farewells to the two of them after participating in an exchange I
LINE 387: could not have cared less about— "I think it's about a degree cooler than it
LINE 388: was yesterday. " "No, I think it's a degree warmer" —that lasted as long as it
LINE 389: took to finish a can of juice.
LINE 390: "Good luck tonight," says Saya.
LINE 391: "We'll come by and watch later," promises Tesshi.
LINE 392: "You seriously don't have to! Actually, don't you dare!" I warn them, but
LINE 393: inside, I'm sending a prayer in their direction. Do your best to turn into an
LINE 394: actual couple, you two! After climbing the stone steps for a while, I turn back,
LINE 395: looking at the pair of them as they sit on the bench with the sunset-colored lake
LINE 396: in the background, and I softly layer a lyrical piano melody over the scene.
LINE 397: Mm-hmm, y'all really do look good together. Tonight, I must perform my awful
LINE 398: duty, but I hope you can enjoy your youth.
LINE 399: "Awww, I wanna do it, too," Yotsuha grumbles.
LINE 400: "It's too soon for you yet, Yotsuha," hushes Gran.
LINE 401: The constant click of spherical weights knocking together echoes in a
LINE 402: workroom big enough for only about eight tatami mats. "Listen to the voice of
LINE 403: the thread," Gran tells her. Even as she speaks, her hands don't pause in their
LINE 404: work. "If you keep windin' threads that way, before long, emotions will start
LINE 405: runnin' between you and the thread."
LINE 406: "Huh? But thread doesn't talk."
LINE 407: "Our braided cords—," Gran continues, ignoring Yotsuha's objection. All
LINE 408: three of us are wearing kimonos, and we're finishing up the cords that we'll
LINE 409: use in tonight's ceremony.
LINE 410: Braided cords are made of thin threads plaited together into a single rope.
LINE 411: It's a traditional folk art that's been handed down for a very long time. The
LINE 412: finished cords are cute and colorful, with all sorts of designs braided into
LINE 413: them. That said, the work takes quite a bit of skill, so Gran's making Yotsuha's
LINE 414: for her. Yotsuha's spending the time doing assistant work, winding thread
LINE 415: around the ball-weights.
LINE 416: "Our braided cords hold a thousand years of Itomori's history. I tell you,
LINE 417: that school of yours really should put priority on teachin' this sort of town
LINE 418: history to you children. Listen, two hundred years ago..."
LINE 419: Here we go again, I think with a wry little smile. It's Gran's favorite
LINE 420: speech, and I've heard it over and over in this workroom, ever since I was
LINE 421: small.
LINE 422: "A fire began in the bathroom of Mayugorou Yamazaki, the straw sandal-
LINE 423: maker, and it burned up this whole area, including the shrine and all the old
LINE 424: records. It was what people call—"
LINE 425: Gran glances at me.
LINE 426: "'The Great Mayugorou Fire,"' I answer smoothly.
LINE 427: Mm-hmm. Gran nods, looking satisfied.
LINE 428: "What? They named the fire after him?!" Yotsuha exclaims, startled. "Poor
LINE 429: Mr. Mayugorou," she mutters. "Havin' his name stick around 'cause of
LINE 430: somethin' like that."
LINE 431: "Thanks to that fire, we don't know what our dances or the patterns in our
LINE 432: cords mean anymore. All we have left are the forms. Still, even not knowin',
LINE 433: we mustn't ever let the forms disappear. The meanin' in those shapes is bound
LINE 434: to resurface someday."
LINE 435: Gran's words have a unique rhythm to them, like a traditional ballad, and as
LINE 436: I braid my cord, I mouth the words along with her, silently reciting them from
LINE 437: memory. The meanin ' in those shapes is bound to resurface someday. Here,
LINE 438: at Miyamizu Shrine —
LINE 439: "Here, at Miyamizu Shrine, that's our solemn duty. And yet..."
LINE 440: At that point, Gran lowers her mild eyes, sadly.
LINE 441: "And yet, that foolish son of mine... As if abandonin' the priesthood and
LINE 442: leavin' this house weren't enough, he had to become a politician..."
LINE 443: Gran sighs, and I sneak a small sigh of my own underneath it. Even I don't
LINE 444: really know whether I love this town or hate it, whether I want to go
LINE 445: somewhere far away or stay with my family and friends forever. When I
LINE 446: remove my finished, brightly colored cord from the round stand, it makes a
LINE 447: soft, lonely click.
LINE 448: I think the sound of the wooden Japanese flute that drifts from the shrine in the
LINE 449: darkness would probably terrify city folks. It sets the mood for some sinister
LINE 450: event, like in an old murder mystery novel. For a little while now, I've been
LINE 451: performing a ceremonial shrine maiden dance, feeling gloomy enough that I
LINE 452: wish a killer like Jason or Jack the Ripper—anybody really—would just put
LINE 453: me out of my misery.
LINE 454: This time every year, the Miyamizu Shrine holds its harvest festival, and
LINE 455: Yotsuha and I have the misfortune of being the stars of the show. On this day,
LINE 456: we wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear
LINE 457: jingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura
LINE 458: hall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose
LINE 459: meaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.
LINE 460: We're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,
LINE 461: twirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.
LINE 462: During my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and
LINE 463: got even more depressed. Those little— I told them and told them not to come,
LINE 464: and they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text
LINE 465: them tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.
LINE 466: Sure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,
LINE 467: I'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's
LINE 468: more embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The
LINE 469: part that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.
LINE 470: Oh, for the love of—
LINE 471: I don't wanna!
LINE 472: Plagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the
LINE 473: dance ends. Agh. Here it comes.
LINE 474: Munch, munch, munch.
LINE 475: Munch.
LINE 476: Munch, munch, munch, munch.
LINE 477: I'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to
LINE 478: think, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing
LINE 479: the exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small
LINE 480: wooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,
LINE 481: a diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.
LINE 482: Munch, munch, munch.
LINE 483: Munch, munch.
LINE 484: Agh, I swear...
LINE 485: Munch, munch, munch.
LINE 486: I'm going to have to do it soon.
LINE 487: Munch, munch.
LINE 488: Arrrgh.
LINE 489: Munch.
LINE 490: Giving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,
LINE 491: attempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.
LINE 492: And then. Aaagh.
LINE 493: Puckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The
LINE 494: mixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I
LINE 495: feel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.
LINE 496: Please, nobody look at me.
LINE 497: Mouth-brewed sake.
LINE 498: It's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with
LINE 499: saliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to
LINE 500: the gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I
LINE 501: don't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first
LINE 502: century... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!
LINE 503: I mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice
LINE 504: and put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the
LINE 505: exact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over
LINE 506: and over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.
LINE 507: Inside, I'm crying my eyes out.
LINE 508: Abruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a
LINE 509: faint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.
LINE 510: Curses.
LINE 511: I want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy
LINE 512: "in-crowd" classmates. They're watching me with smirks on their faces and
LINE 513: gleefully gossiping about something. There's too much distance between us for
LINE 514: me to really hear them but I feel as though I'm hearing them loud and clear.
LINE 515: Eeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how
LINE 516: can she do that in public? Nobody's ever gonna marry her now.
LINE 517: I make a very, very firm resolution:
LINE 518: When I graduate, I am leaving this town and going far away.
LINE 519: "Cheer up, Sis. Who cares if people from your school saw you? And
LINE 520: anyway, what's got you so shook up?"
LINE 521: "It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!"
LINE 522: I glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office
LINE 523: entrance.
LINE 524: After the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a
LINE 525: banquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was
LINE 526: the hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.
LINE 527: "How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a
LINE 528: sweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. "
LINE 529: "Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead—drink some
LINE 530: more!"
LINE 531: We entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally
LINE 532: turned us loose just now, saying, "You kids can go on home." Gran and the
LINE 533: other adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.
LINE 534: "Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?"
LINE 535: On the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool
LINE 536: sounds of insect songs echo all around us.
LINE 537: "I dunno. Sixty?"
LINE 538: "I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!"
LINE 539: "Huh."
LINE 540: "Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.
LINE 541: They're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the
LINE 542: whole place!"
LINE 543: "Hmm..."
LINE 544: What I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but
LINE 545: Yotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,
LINE 546: she's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving
LINE 547: up, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,
LINE 548: shining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.
LINE 549: "...That's it!"
LINE 550: As we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha
LINE 551: suddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a
LINE 552: cake someone hid from her.
LINE 553: "Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay
LINE 554: your way to Tokyo?!"
LINE 555: For a moment, I'm speechless.
LINE 556: ".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that."
LINE 557: "You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and
LINE 558: call it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!"
LINE 559: Should I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?
LINE 560: Still, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she
LINE 561: really is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll
LINE 562: give this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell
LINE 563: sake on your own like that?
LINE 564: "Well? What do you think, Sis?"
LINE 565: "Hmm..."
LINE 566: .. .And that's all I have to say.
LINE 567: ".. .Wait, no! It'd be against the liquor laws!"
LINE 568: Wait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,
LINE 569: I've broken into a run. All sorts of incidents and feelings and prospects and
LINE 570: doubts and despairs are jumbled together inside me, and it feels like my heart's
LINE 571: about to explode. I run down the steps, taking them two at a time, slam on the
LINE 572: brakes under the torii gate on the landing, and suck in a huge lungful of chilly
LINE 573: night air. Then I expel the cluttered mess in my chest along with it.
LINE 574: "I'm sick of this town! I'm sick of this life! Make me a hot guy in Tokyo in
LINE 575: my next life, puhleeeease!"
LINE 576: Eeease. Eeease. Eeease. Eeease...
LINE 577: My wish echoes around the dark mountains, then disappears as though
LINE 578: drawn into Itomori Lake below me. The words came out on impulse, and
LINE 579: they're so dumb, my head cools right down, as does my sweat.
LINE 580: Oh, but even so.
LINE 581: Gods, if you're really there...
LINE 582: Please—
LINE 583: Even if the gods really do exist, I still don't know what to wish for.
