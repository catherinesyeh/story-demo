LINE 1: A nostalgic voice and scent. Cherished light and warmth.
LINE 2: I'm pressed against someone very special to me, so close that
LINE 3: there's no space between us. We're bound to one another, almost
LINE 4: inseparable. Like an infant cradled at its mother's breast, I'm wholly
LINE 5: untouched by anxiety or loneliness. I've never encountered the sting
LINE 6: of loss. A tingling, exquisitely sweet feeling fills me.
LINE 7: Abruptly, my eyes open.
LINE 8: There's the ceiling.
LINE 9: I'm in my room. It's morning.
LINE 10: I'm alone.
LINE 11: Tokyo.
LINE 12: ...I see.
LINE 13: I've been dreaming. I sit up in bed.
LINE 14: In that two-second span, the sense of unity that enveloped me a
LINE 15: moment earlier vanishes without a trace, without an echo. It's so
LINE 16: sudden that, before I have time to so much as form a thought, the
LINE 17: tears come.
LINE 18: Every so often when I wake up in the morning, for some reason,
LINE 19: I'm crying.
LINE 20: ...And I can never remember what I was dreaming about.
LINE 21: I wipe the tears away with my right hand, then stare at it.
LINE 22: Little drops of water dot my index finger. Both the dream and
LINE 23: the tears that briefly filled my eyes have already evaporated.
LINE 24: This hand once held something really precious...
LINE 25: I don't know.
LINE 26: I give up, get out of bed, leave my room, and head for the
LINE 27: bathroom. Washing my face, I get the feeling that the taste
LINE 28: and lukewarm temperature of this water once startled me,
LINE 29: and I look into the mirror.
LINE 30: My reflection stares back. He seems vaguely unhappy.
LINE 31: Gazing into the mirror, I do my hair, pulling my arms through the
LINE 32: sleeves of my spring suit.
LINE 33: I tie the necktie I've finally gotten used to, then put on my
LINE 34: jacket.
LINE 35: I open the door of my apartment...
LINE 36: I shut the door to my condo. In front of me...
LINE 37: Tokyo's cityscape, which I've finally gotten accustomed to, spreads
LINE 38: out before me. Just as I once learned the names of the mountain
LINE 39: peaks, I can name a few of the skyscrapers now without even trying.
LINE 40: I get through the turnstile at the crowded station, take the
LINE 41: escalator down...
LINE 42: I board a commuter train. Leaning against the door, I watch the
LINE 43: scenery flow by. The city teems with peopleâ€”in the windows of
LINE 44: buildings, in cars, on pedestrian bridges.
LINE 45: A hazy, pale spring sky. A hundred people to a car, a
LINE 46: thousand people to a train, a thousand trains crisscrossing
LINE 47: the city.
LINE 48: Before I know it, just like always, as I gaze out over those streets...
LINE 49: I'm...
LINE 50: .. .looking for someone. Just one person.
LINE 51: I'm...
