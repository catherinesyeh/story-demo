LINE 1: Chapter Six
LINE 2: Reenactment
LINE 3: My eyes open.
LINE 4: In that instant, I know for sure.
LINE 5: I bolt upright, looking down at my body. Slim fingers. Familiar pajamas.
LINE 6: The swell of breasts.
LINE 7: "It's Mitsuha..."
LINE 8: The words slip out. This voice, too. This narrow throat. Her blood, her
LINE 9: flesh, her bones, her skin. Everything about Mitsuha is warm and right here.
LINE 10: "...She's alive...!"
LINE 11: I wrap my arms around my body, hugging myself. Tears spill over. Plump
LINE 12: teardrops fall relentlessly from Mitsuha's eyes, as though a faucet has broken.
LINE 13: Their heat brings its own joy, and I cry harder and harder. Inside my ribs, my
LINE 14: heart leaps. I bend my knees, pressing my cheeks against the smooth kneecaps.
LINE 15: I curl up as small as I can, wanting to hug her entire body.
LINE 16: Mitsuha.
LINE 17: Mitsuha, Mitsuha.
LINE 18: It's a miracle—one that might have been denied me forever, one that
LINE 19: slipped through every possibility to be here.
LINE 20: "Sis, what're you doin'?"
LINE 21: I raise my head at the sound of the voice. Yotsuha's standing there in the
LINE 22: open doorway.
LINE 23: "Oh... Little sister...," I mutter, sobs strangling my words. Yotsuha's still
LINE 24: alive, too. She's staring, dazed, at her older sister, who's all tear-stained and
LINE 25: snotty and feeling herself up.
LINE 26: "Yotsuhaaaaa!"
LINE 27: I rush at her, driven by an urge to scoop her up. "Yeep!" she gasps,
LINE 28: slamming the sliding door in my face.
LINE 29: "Gran! Hey, Gran!" she yells, and I hear footsteps running down the stairs.
LINE 30: "Sis finally cracked! She's completely busted!"
LINE 31: Her voice echoes from downstairs as she runs wailing to her grandma.
LINE 32: ...What a rude little girl. And after I crossed space and time to save this
LINE 33: town!
LINE 34: The NHK lady is yapping cheerfully. I've just changed into my school
LINE 35: uniform and come downstairs. It's been a while since my skirt-clad lower
LINE 36: body felt this vulnerable, and in order to shake the sensation, I'm standing tall
LINE 37: and tough, glaring at the TV
LINE 38: "Comet Tiamat has now been visible to the naked eye for about a week. It
LINE 39: will be closest to Earth at approximately seven forty this evening, which is
LINE 40: when it's expected to be brightest as well. The astronomy spectacular that only
LINE 41: comes once every twelve centuries has reached its climax, and various
LINE 42: festivities will be held all around the..."
LINE 43: "Tonight! There's still time!" I mutter. I'm trembling with nerves and
LINE 44: excitement.
LINE 45: "Good mornin', Mitsuha. Yotsuha went on ahead today."
LINE 46: I turn around, and the old lady's standing there.
LINE 47: "Grandma! You're looking good!" Without thinking, I run over to her. She
LINE 48: has a teapot on a tray, probably planning to enjoy some tea in the living room.
LINE 49: "Huh? ...My. You're..."
LINE 50: She pulls down her reading glasses and takes a good look at my face. Her
LINE 51: eyes narrow softly.
LINE 52: "You aren't Mitsuha, are you?"
LINE 53: "Wha...?" How?! I feel guilty, as if some crime I knew would never come
LINE 54: to light has been exposed. Hang on, though. This might make things easier.
LINE 55: "Grandma... You knew?"
LINE 56: There's no particular change in the old lady's expression. As she speaks,
LINE 57: she lowers herself into a legless chair.
LINE 58: "No. But watchin' you lately reminded me. When I was a girl, I had some
LINE 59: strange dreams myself."
LINE 60: Hear that?! That's awesome—this oughta be a quick conversation, then.
LINE 61: Just what I'd expect from a Japanese folktale family. I join her at the table, and
LINE 62: the old lady fills a cup for me, too. Sipping her tea, she continues her story.
LINE 63: "They were very odd dreams. More than dreams, really. They were another
LINE 64: life. I became a boy I didn't know in a town I'd never seen before."
LINE 65: I swallow hard. Exactly like us...
LINE 66: "But one day, they ended, just like that. All I remember now is that I had
LINE 67: strange dreams. My memories of who I became in them disappeared
LINE 68: completely."
LINE 69: "Disappeared..."
LINE 70: My heart skips a beat, as if I've been told the name of a disease I'm fated to
LINE 71: get. She's right. For a little while, I forgot Mitsuha's name. I tried to convince
LINE 72: myself that it was all a delusion. The old lady's wrinkled face takes on a tinge
LINE 73: of loneliness.
LINE 74: "So treasure who you are now and the things you're seein'. No matter how
LINE 75: special it is, a dream's a dream. It'll disappear for sure someday, once you
LINE 76: wake. We all had a time like that, you know: my mother, myself, and your
LINE 77: mother."
LINE 78: "That's... What if...?!"
LINE 79: Abruptly, it hits me. This might be a role passed down through the
LINE 80: Miyamizu family: the ability to communicate with someone living a few years
LINE 81: in the future to escape the disaster that strikes every twelve hundred years. A
LINE 82: shrine maiden's role. Something the Miyamizu bloodline acquired at some
LINE 83: point.. .a warning system inherited across generations.
LINE 84: "Maybe the Miyamizus' dreams were all for today!"
LINE 85: I look the old lady straight in the eye, speaking firmly. "Grandma, listen."
LINE 86: She raises her head. From her expression, I can't tell how she'll take what
LINE 87: I'm about to say.
LINE 88: "Tonight, a meteorite will strike the town of Itomori, and everyone will
LINE 89: die."
LINE 90: This time, the old lady's eyebrows knit in unmistakable doubt.
LINE 91: "Nobody'd believe hooey like that." That old broad says some
LINE 92: surprisingly normal stuff.
LINE 93: I run down the hill to the high school, silently brooding to myself.
LINE 94: She believes the swapping dreams but not the meteorite strike. What sort of
LINE 95: sense of balance does she have, anyway?
LINE 96: I'm really late, and there's almost nobody around. The calls of the copper
LINE 97: pheasants echo, piichik paachik, and it's just another peaceful morning in
LINE 98: town. We 'll have to do it ourselves, I think.
LINE 99: "There's no way I'm letting anybody die!"
LINE 100: I shout it out loud, emphatically, as if hammering the resolution into my own
LINE 101: mind. I run even faster. There's not even half a day left until that meteor comes
LINE 102: down.
LINE 103: "Mitsuha, wha...? Y-your hair...!"
LINE 104: "Girl, that hair! What on earth?!"
LINE 105: The second I enter the classroom, Teshigawara and Saya stare at my
LINE 106: (Mitsuha's) face, dumbfounded.
LINE 107: "Oh yeah, the hair? It was way better before, right?"
LINE 108: As I speak, I flip the shoulder-length bob away from the back of my neck.
LINE 109: Come to think of it, Mitsuha lopped off most of that long hair of hers at some
LINE 110: point, didn't she? I prefer long black hair, so I'm not a fan of this... No, that's
LINE 111: not what's important now!
LINE 112: "Never mind that!"
LINE 113: Teshigawara's mouth is hanging open so wide, I can practically hear the
LINE 114: sound effect for shock. Saya's examining me searchingly. I look back and forth
LINE 115: between them.
LINE 116: "If nothing changes, everyone's gonna die tonight!"
LINE 117: The hum in the classroom stops dead. All our classmates' eyes are on me.
LINE 118: "H-hold it, Mitsuha. What're you sayin'?!"
LINE 119: Saya hastily stands up, and Teshigawara grabs my arm and pulls me. As
LINE 120: they drag me out of the classroom, my head finally cools down a bit. I guess
LINE 121: it's only natural that they wouldn't believe me. Maybe it's like the old lady
LINE 122: said, and it's unreasonable to expect people to buy something like this out of
LINE 123: the blue. I was so excited about swapping for the first time in ages that I
LINE 124: convinced myself things would just work out somehow.
LINE 125: Hmm. This might be tougher than I expected.
LINE 126: ...Or so I thought, but as far as Teshigawara was concerned, that was
LINE 127: wasted worry.
LINE 128: "Mitsuha, is that for real?"
LINE 129: "Yes, it's for real! Tonight, Comet Tiamat is going to split and turn into a
LINE 130: meteorite, and it's hugely likely it's gonna hit this town. I can't reveal my
LINE 131: sources, but I got the information through a reliable channel."
LINE 132: "That's.. .a full-on emergency!"
LINE 133: "C'mon, Tesshi, what're you lookin' so serious for? Are you really that
LINE 134: dumb?"
LINE 135: Naturally, Saya isn't having any of it.
LINE 136: "What's this source of yours, anyway? The CIA? NASA? What're you goin'
LINE 137: on about? 'Reliable channels'? You pretendin' you're a spy now? Honestly,
LINE 138: Mitsuha, what's the matter with you?!"
LINE 139: She couldn't be more sensible. Getting desperate, I dump all the money out
LINE 140: of Mitsuha's wallet.
LINE 141: "Saya, please! I'll pay, so take this and go buy whatever you want! Then at
LINE 142: least listen to what I've got to say!"
LINE 143: I'm begging, and my expression is dead serious. Startled, Saya takes a long,
LINE 144: hard look at me.
LINE 145: "But you're always tight with your money... You're really goin' that far?"
LINE 146: Huh? She is? But she burned through my money like crazy!
LINE 147: Saya sighs, as if she's resigned herself. "...I guess I'll have to, then. None
LINE 148: of this makes any sense, but fine, I'll at least listen. Tesshi, gimme the key to
LINE 149: your bike." She sets off for the main entrance, grumbling, "This ain't enough
LINE 150: for more than a couple cheap sweets."
LINE 151: Good. It looks like the amount wasn't enough, but she believes I'm serious
LINE 152: now.
LINE 153: "I'm goin' to the convenience store. Tesshi, you keep a close eye on
LINE 154: Mitsuha. She ain't quite right."
LINE 155: And so Teshigawara and I sneak into a room in the club building nobody
LINE 156: uses anymore and put together an evacuation plan for the town.
LINE 157: The goal is to get all 188 families—about five hundred people—out of the
LINE 158: danger zone before the meteorite falls. The first thing we think of is
LINE 159: broadcasting an evacuation order.
LINE 160: After we run through the inevitable ridiculous ideas— We'll take over the
LINE 161: prime minister's official residence! Or the Diet Building! Or the NHK
LINE 162: Shibuya Broadcasting Center, or at least the NHK Gifu-Takayama branch
LINE 163: office! —we start talking about how not everybody in town will be at home
LINE 164: with their TVs or radios on and how even more people will be out and about
LINE 165: because of the autumn festival tonight. Then we fall silent, thinking.
LINE 166: ".. .The disaster alert system!" Teshigawara shouts suddenly.
LINE 167: "Disaster alert system?"
LINE 168: "Hunh? Don't go tellin' me you don't know. There are speakers all over
LINE 169: town, remember?"
LINE 170: "Oh... That thing that starts talking out of the blue every morning and
LINE 171: evening? Who was born, who's having a funeral, that sort of thing?"
LINE 172: "Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you're inside or
LINE 173: out. If we send the order over that...!"
LINE 174: "Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn't it? Would
LINE 175: they let us broadcast stuff if we asked?"
LINE 176: "Pssh. No."
LINE 177: "Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we'd have a
LINE 178: better shot at that than at taking over NHK, but..."
LINE 179: "Heh-heh-heh." With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his
LINE 180: phone. Geez, this guy looks happy.
LINE 181: "We can do this!"
LINE 182: He holds out his phone to me.
LINE 183: Superimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.
LINE 184: "Wha...? Is this for real?"
LINE 185: Teshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.
LINE 186: "Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?"
LINE 187: "Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y'know? About destroyin' the
LINE 188: town, overthrowin' the school, stuff like that. Doesn't everybody?"
LINE 189: "Huh...?" That weirds me out a bit. But, no—this is...
LINE 190: "This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!"
LINE 191: Without thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara's shoulders.
LINE 192: "H-hey, don't get too close!"
LINE 193: "Huh?"
LINE 194: Whoa. Even his ears are red.
LINE 195: "What's this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?"
LINE 196: I look up into Teshigawara's face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,
LINE 197: Mitsuha, you're not to be taken lightly, are you? C'mon, c'mon! I press my
LINE 198: body against him some more. Here you go—have a freebie! We're sitting side
LINE 199: by side on an old sofa, and Tesshi's already right by the wall, so he's got
LINE 200: nowhere to run.
LINE 201: "Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!"
LINE 202: Teshigawara resists, big body squirming. He's a guy, for sure... Well, so
LINE 203: am I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,
LINE 204: and yells, "I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age—that ain't proper!"
LINE 205: "Ha..."
LINE 206: Even his buzzed scalp is red. He's sweating bullets, and his eyes look
LINE 207: almost teary.
LINE 208: "Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you're such a...!"
LINE 209: In spite of myself, I crack up laughing.
LINE 210: He's a really good guy, and I'm positive I can count on him.
LINE 211: I thought of him as a friend before, but I'd like to meet him and the others
LINE 212: for real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and
LINE 213: Saya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it'd
LINE 214: be a blast.
LINE 215: "Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me..." I'm biting back
LINE 216: laughter, and Teshigawara's sulking. "Will you help me think up the rest of the
LINE 217: evacuation plan?"
LINE 218: I smile at him Tesshi's face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.
LINE 219: Once this is over, I'll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit
LINE 220: dazzled.
LINE 221: "A-a-a...a bomb?!"
LINE 222: Saya yells. She's eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.
LINE 223: "Technically, they're called water-gel explosives. They're kinda like
LINE 224: dynamite," Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He's crunching away on
LINE 225: potato chips, and I'm noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of
LINE 226: convenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like
LINE 227: we're having a party.
LINE 228: Teshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully
LINE 229: engineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic
LINE 230: music to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged—something
LINE 231: that sounds like a strategy meeting.
LINE 232: Taking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.
LINE 233: "There's lots of explosives in my dad's company's warehouse, for construction
LINE 234: stuff. If I don't have to worry about gettin' caught afterward, I can snatch as
LINE 235: much as we need."
LINE 236: "Then, next," I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I'm really hungry, and
LINE 237: for some reason, everything I eat when I'm in Mitsuha's body tastes really
LINE 238: good.
LINE 239: "Y-y-y.. .you're gonna hijack the signal?!" Saya's voice cracks.
LINE 240: Munching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. "Rural wireless disaster
LINE 241: alert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the
LINE 242: transmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The
LINE 243: speakers are made so they'll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered
LINE 244: over the audio."
LINE 245: Melon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. "That means we can
LINE 246: send the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room."
LINE 247: I point at the map of Itomori. There's a circle with a diameter of a little less
LINE 248: than a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.
LINE 249: "This is the area that's supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you
LINE 250: can see, Itomori High is outside it." I tap on the location of the high school.
LINE 251: "In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard."
LINE 252: "B-but that's..." Saya begins stammering nervously. "That's a full-blown
LINE 253: crime!"
LINE 254: Even as she says it, she's putting the strawberry—which she saved for last
LINE 255: —in her mouth.
LINE 256: "We'll never get the people around here to move without committing a
LINE 257: crime," I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I'd scattered over
LINE 258: the map. That's right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it
LINE 259: doesn't matter whether it's a crime or not.
LINE 260: "Y'know, Mitsuha, it's like you're a different person."
LINE 261: I grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I'm in this body, I
LINE 262: unconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I've completely abandoned
LINE 263: trying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when
LINE 264: everything's over, nothing else matters. As long as we're all alive, things will
LINE 265: work out.
LINE 266: "...So. You're the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya," I tell her
LINE 267: cheerfully.
LINE 268: "Why?!"
LINE 269: "Well, you're in the broadcasting club, right?"
LINE 270: "Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell
LINE 271: you the wireless frequency," says Teshigawara.
LINE 272: "Huh? I can't just..."
LINE 273: Ignoring Saya's protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. "I'm the
LINE 274: explosives guy!"
LINE 275: "And I'm going to go talk to the mayor," I say, pointing to myself.
LINE 276: "Huh?!" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.
LINE 277: "We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just
LINE 278: talked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don't come out at the end,
LINE 279: there's no way we'll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to
LINE 280: move, y'know?"
LINE 281: "That's why we need to persuade the mayor," I tell her. "I'm his daughter. If
LINE 282: I can explain it to him rationally, I'm sure he'll understand."
LINE 283: Teshigawara folds his arms and nods, patting himself on the back. "It's a
LINE 284: perfect strategy!" That's exactly how I feel. True, our methods are a bit rough,
LINE 285: but I don't think there's any other way to do it.
LINE 286: "Haaaaaah..." Saya watches us with her mouth agape, though I can't tell
LINE 287: whether she's amazed or appalled. "Well, I'm impressed you thought it through
LINE 288: that far, but... This is all just in case something happens, isn't it?"
LINE 289: "Huh?"
LINE 290: I hadn't expected that question this late in the game, and I'm at a loss for
LINE 291: words.
LINE 292: "Uh.. .not exactly..."
LINE 293: If Saya doesn't get on board, this plan won't work. I don't know what to
LINE 294: tell her, and I search for something to say.
LINE 295: "That ain't necessarily so!" Abruptly, Teshigawara jumps in, thrusting out
LINE 296: the screen on his phone. "Do you know how Itomori Lake got made?"
LINE 297: Saya and I squint at the screen. It's a site that looks like the town's home
LINE 298: page, with a header that says The Origins of Itomori Lake. Then the words A
LINE 299: meteoric lake from twelve hundred years ago, and Incredibly rare for Japan.
LINE 300: "It's a meteoric lake! This place already had at least one meteorite strike!"
LINE 301: As Teshigawara says this, a triumphant look on his face, something clicks in
LINE 302: my mind. I start speaking before I even know what it is. "That's right—he's
LINE 303: right... That's why!"
LINE 304: That's why there was a picture of the comet in a place like that, I realize.
LINE 305: Comet Tiamat has a twelve-hundred-year cycle. Itomori Lake is a twelve-
LINE 306: hundred-year-old meteoric lake. The meteorite strikes every twelve hundred
LINE 307: years, when the comet passes. A presaged disaster. That means it should be
LINE 308: avoidable. That picture was both a message and a warning.
LINE 309: I feel as if I've picked up an unexpected ally. I can't hold still any longer.
LINE 310: The preparations for this were laid a thousand years ago!
LINE 311: "Good one, Tesshi!"
LINE 312: Without thinking, I stick out my fist, and Teshigawara bumps it. "Yeah!"
LINE 313: This will work. It's gonna work!
LINE 314: "Let's do this!"
LINE 315: We turn to Saya, speaking in unison, spit flying with enthusiasm.
LINE 316: ".. .What are you talking about?"
LINE 317: The voice is rough and heavy, like the sound of scissors cutting into thick
LINE 318: cardboard.
LINE 319: I get increasingly flustered. I talk louder, so as not to get steamrolled. "I
LINE 320: told you! You have to evacuate the townspeople, just in case, or—"
LINE 321: "Be quiet a minute."
LINE 322: His voice isn't raised at all, but it shuts me up.
LINE 323: Mitsuha's dad, Mayor Miyamizu, closes his eyes wearily and leans back in
LINE 324: the upholstered chair in his office. The thick leather creaks audibly. Then he
LINE 325: exhales, slowly, and gazes out the window. The shadows of the leaves sway in
LINE 326: the bright afternoon sunlight.
LINE 327: ".. .The comet is going to split in two and fall on this town? More than five
LINE 328: hundred people could die?"
LINE 329: He taps the desk with his fingertips, leaving a long pause. Then finally, he
LINE 330: returns his gaze to me. The backs of my knees are sweating. For the first time, I
LINE 331: realize that's where Mitsuha gets sweaty when she's nervous.
LINE 332: "I know it's hard to believe, but I do have grounds for—"
LINE 333: "How dare you come to me with nonsense like that!"
LINE 334: Out of nowhere, he explodes. The creases between his eyes grow deeper.
LINE 335: "Do delusions run in the Miyamizu bloodline?" he grumbles quietly, as if
LINE 336: talking to himself. He fixes me with a piercing look and speaks in a low tone.
LINE 337: "Listen, Mitsuha. If you're being serious with me, then you are ill."
LINE 338: "...Wha—?"
LINE 339: The words won't come. I realize the confidence I'd had in the clubroom
LINE 340: just thirty minutes ago is gone without a trace. The uneasy feeling that I'm
LINE 341: actually misguided is building rapidly. No, that's not true. I'm not deluded, and
LINE 342: I'm not sick. I'm—
LINE 343: "I'll send a car around for you." The mayor picks up the phone, suddenly
LINE 344: sounding concerned. He starts dialing, initiating a call even as he's speaking to
LINE 345: me. "Have a doctor at the city hospital look at you. After that, I'll hear what
LINE 346: you have to say."
LINE 347: The words send an unpleasant jolt through me. This guy is seriously treating
LINE 348: me, his own daughter, like a head case. The second it registers, my whole body
LINE 349: goes as cold as ice, while the core of my brain flares so hot it might as well be
LINE 350: on fire.
LINE 351: It's rage.
LINE 352: "—Don't you talk down to me, you bastard!"
LINE 353: The words come out as a scream. The mayor's wide eyes are right in front
LINE 354: of me. Without thinking, I've grabbed him by his necktie and hauled him up.
LINE 355: The phone receiver falls to the floor beside the desk, and I hear the tiny buzz of
LINE 356: a dead line.
LINE 357: "...Ah—"
LINE 358: I relax my grip. Slowly, the man's face recedes. Mayor Miyamizu's lips are
LINE 359: slack and trembling slightly, in either shock or bewilderment. We're staring
LINE 360: each other in the eye. Neither of us is able to look away. A cold sweat opens
LINE 361: every pore on my body.
LINE 362: "Mitsuha."
LINE 363: The mayor sounds as if he's struggling to squeeze the air out.
LINE 364: "No... Who are you?"
LINE 365: He's trembling. With a nasty sensation, like a little winged bug the wind
LINE 366: carried in, the words linger in my ears for a very long time.
LINE 367: Faintly, I can hear the reverberations of hammering in the distance. It's
LINE 368: sometime between midday and evening. The town is too quiet, and even sounds
LINE 369: from very far off reach my ears on the breeze. Tok-tok, tok-tok.
LINE 370: After leaving the mayor's office, I trudge along the hill road overlooking
LINE 371: the lake, picturing a nail being driven into hard lumber in time with the noise.
LINE 372: An iron nail, wedged into dark, cramped splinters, destined to rust. They 're
LINE 373: probably getting ready for the autumn festival up at the shrine , I think
LINE 374: absently, gazing at the wooden lanterns that line the road.
LINE 375: Hearing children's voices above me—"'Kay, see you later!"—I lookup.
LINE 376: Farther up the slope, kids with backpacks are waving to one another.
LINE 377: "Mm-hmm, I'll see you at the festival."
LINE 378: "Meet us below the shrine."
LINE 379: With that, a boy and girl part ways with their friend and come running
LINE 380: toward me. They're in the middle years of elementary school, probably about
LINE 381: Yotsuha's age.
LINE 382: It fell on the shrine.
LINE 383: "Don't go!" The boy's just about to run past me, and without thinking, I grab
LINE 384: his shoulders. "Get out of town! Tell your friends, too!"
LINE 385: Between my arms, the expression of a kid I don't even know slides into
LINE 386: terror.
LINE 387: "Wh-what's wrong with you?!"
LINE 388: He shoves my hands away. I come back to my senses.
LINE 389: "Sis!"
LINE 390: When I turn toward the voice, Yotsuha's running down the hill toward me,
LINE 391: wearing her backpack and a worried expression. The two kids make a break
LINE 392: for it and dash away. I can't do stuff like this. I'll just seem creepy.
LINE 393: "Sis?! What'd you do to those kids?!" Yotsuha pounces on me, grabbing my
LINE 394: arms and looking up into my face.
LINE 395: What am I supposed to do now?
LINE 396: I look at Yotsuha. She's anxiously waiting for me to say something. "If
LINE 397: Mitsuha had tried..." I murmur the thoughts as they come. "Could she have
LINE 398: talked him into it? Is it just me who can't do it?" Yotsuha's bewildered, but I
LINE 399: ignore her and keep going. "Yotsuha, before evening comes, take Grandma and
LINE 400: get out of town."
LINE 401: "Huh?"
LINE 402: "If you stay here, you'll die!"
LINE 403: "What?! Sis, c'mon—what're you talkin' about?!"
LINE 404: "This is important," I tell her, but Yotsuha desperately raises her voice,
LINE 405: trying to push my words back at me.
LINE 406: "Sis, snap out of it!"
LINE 407: Her eyes are tearing up. She's scared. As Yotsuha speaks, she stands on her
LINE 408: tiptoes, gazing into my eyes. "You took off for Tokyo all of a sudden yesterday,
LINE 409: too. You've been weird all the time lately, Sis!"
LINE 410: "Huh?"
LINE 411: I feel a strange sense of wrongness... Tokyo?
LINE 412: "Yotsuha, did you just say Tokyo?"
LINE 413: "Heeey, Mitsuhaaa!"
LINE 414: It's Saya. When I look up, she's waving wildly from the back of the bike
LINE 415: Teshigawara's pedaling. It brakes, skidding a bit on the asphalt.
LINE 416: "Did you talk to your dad?! How'd it go?!"
LINE 417: Teshigawara's leaning forward. I can't respond. I'm confused. I don't know
LINE 418: what to think anymore. The mayor wouldn't listen to a word I said. Not only
LINE 419: that, the guy asked his own daughter who she was. / made him do that. Is it
LINE 420: because I'm in Mitsuha? Is that why it didn't work? In that case, where is she
LINE 421: now? Yotsuha says Mitsuha went to Tokyo yesterday. Why? When was
LINE 422: "yesterday"?
LINE 423: "Hey, Mitsuha?" I hear Teshigawara's puzzled voice.
LINE 424: "What's wrong with your sis?" Sayaka asks Yotsuha.
LINE 425: Where is Mitsuha? Where am I, right now?
LINE 426: What if... ?
LINE 427: I lift my eyes. Beyond the houses, the rolling outlines of mountains build on
LINE 428: each other, and beyond them, there's a misty blue ridgeline. The mountain I
LINE 429: climbed. The body of the god at the peak. The place where I drank the sake. A
LINE 430: light, cold wind blows up from the lake, stirring Mitsuha's newly short hair.
LINE 431: The strands stroke my cheeks softly, almost like someone's fingertips.
LINE 432: "Is she.. .there?" I mutter.
LINE 433: "Huh? What? What's the matter? Is somethin' up there?"
LINE 434: Yotsuha and Saya and Teshigawara all follow my gaze. Mitsuha, if you're
LINE 435: there—
LINE 436: "Tesshi, let me borrow your bike!"
LINE 437: Even as I speak, I grab the handlebars, wrenching it away from him. I
LINE 438: straddle the seat, then kick off.
LINE 439: "Hey, wha—? Mitsuha!"
LINE 440: The seat's really high. Standing up to pedal, I start climbing the hill road.
LINE 441: "Mitsuha, what about the operation?!"
LINE 442: As I get farther away, Teshigawara yells after me. He sounds like he might
LINE 443: be about to cry.
LINE 444: "Get ready, just like we planned! Please!"
LINE 445: My shout echoes through the hushed town. Severed from her body,
LINE 446: Mitsuha's voice rebounds between the mountains and the lake, filling the air
LINE 447: for a moment. As if chasing that voice, I stomp on the pedals with all my might.
LINE 448: ■# + +
LINE 449: Someone's tapping my cheek.
LINE 450: It's a very faint pressure, probably just the tip of a middle finger. Whoever
LINE 451: it is, is being gentle, trying not to hurt me. The fingertip is very cold. Chilly, as
LINE 452: if a moment earlier it had been touching ice. Who in the world would wake me
LINE 453: up like that?
LINE 454: I open my eyes.
LINE 455: Huh?
LINE 456: It's really dark. Maybe it's still night.
LINE 457: Another tap on my cheek. No... This is water. Drops of water have been
LINE 458: hitting my face. When I sit up, I finally notice.
LINE 459: ".. .I'm Taki!" Without meaning to, I say it out loud.
LINE 460: As I climb the narrow stone steps, the evening sun lances straight into my
LINE 461: eyes.
LINE 462: I must have been in the dark for quite a while. Taki's eyes sting and tear up.
LINE 463: When I've climbed all the way to the top, my guess is confirmed: I'm on the
LINE 464: mountain of the body of the god.
LINE 465: What is Taki doing here?
LINE 466: Without really understanding what's going on, I emerge from beneath the
LINE 467: giant tree and begin walking across the basin. Taki is wearing a heavy camping
LINE 468: parka and hiking shoes with thick rubber soles. The ground is soft and wet, and
LINE 469: it might have just stopped raining—the low grass is thick with water droplets.
LINE 470: When I look up, though, the sky is perfectly clear. Thin, shredded clouds
LINE 471: stream in the wind, glowing and golden.
LINE 472: My memories are oddly vague.
LINE 473: Still unable to remember anything, before long I come to the edge of the
LINE 474: basin, the foot of the slope. I lookup the hill. This whole area is a depression.
LINE 475: The top of this slope is the top of the mountain. I start climbing. As I do, I
LINE 476: search my memories, trying to remember what I was doing before I came here.
LINE 477: Then my fingers touch the edge.
LINE 478: Festival music. A light summer kimono. My own face, hair cut short,
LINE 479: reflected in a mirror.
LINE 480: That's right.
LINE 481: Yesterday was the autumn festival. Tesshi and Saya asked me to go, so I put
LINE 482: on my traditional clothes and went out. It was the day the comet was supposed
LINE 483: to be brightest, so we were going to watch. Yes, that was it. It all seems very
LINE 484: distant somehow, but it was definitely yesterday.
LINE 485: My new haircut really startled Tesshi and Saya. Tesshi's mouth gaped so
LINE 486: wide, you could practically hear the sound effect for shock. They were so
LINE 487: shaken I felt a little sorry for them. The entire walk to the hill, they whispered
LINE 488: behind my back.
LINE 489: "Hey, do you think she got her heart broken? "
LINE 490: "Why do you go there?! Are you some old guy from last century? "
LINE 491: When we'd climbed all the way up the narrow one-lane road and turned at
LINE 492: the traffic mirror, there it was: an enormous comet in the night sky, straight
LINE 493: above us. Its long, streaming tail shone emerald green, and its head was
LINE 494: brighter than the moon. If I strained my eyes, I could see particles glittering
LINE 495: around it like fine dust. We forgot to talk to each other and just stood there with
LINE 496: our mouths open like idiots, staring, fascinated, for a long time.
LINE 497: Then, at some point, I realized the comet had split. There were two big,
LINE 498: bright tips, and one seemed to be steadily coming closer. Before long, several
LINE 499: delicate shooting stars began shining around it. It was like the heavens were
LINE 500: falling. No—that night, the stars actually did fall. It was a sight straight out of a
LINE 501: dream, an impossibly beautiful night sky.
LINE 502: I finally reach the top of the slope. The wind buffeting me is cold. Below
LINE 503: me, a blanket of clouds unfolds like a shining carpet. Through them, I can see
LINE 504: Itomori Lake, which is beginning to be tinted with faint blue shadows.
LINE 505: Huh? I think.
LINE 506: How strange.
LINE 507: For the past little while, I've been shaking so hard it's as if someone's put
LINE 508: me on ice.
LINE 509: Out of nowhere, I'm so scared I can't handle it.
LINE 510: I'm terrified, anxious, sad, and lonely, and it feels like I might lose my
LINE 511: mind. I'm gushing cold sweat as though a tap has broken.
LINE 512: What if...?
LINE 513: Maybe I have gone crazy. Maybe I cracked before I even knew it was
LINE 514: happening.
LINE 515: I'm scared. I'm scared. I want to scream right this minute, but sticky breath
LINE 516: is the only thing that comes out of my throat. My eyelids open wider and wider,
LINE 517: driven by a will that isn't mine. The surfaces of my eyes are desert dry.
LINE 518: They're gazing at the lake. I know. I've seen it.
LINE 519: Itomori is gone.
LINE 520: A bigger round lake has formed, overlapping Itomori Lake.
LINE 521: Somewhere inside my mind, I think, Well, of course it has.
LINE 522: After a thing like that fell on us.
LINE 523: After that leaden, sweltering mass came down on our heads.
LINE 524: That's right.
LINE 525: That night, I...
LINE 526: It's as if my joints have broken without a sound. I drop to my knees on the
LINE 527: spot.
LINE 528: That night... I...
LINE 529: The air that leaks from my throat becomes a voice, just barely.
LINE 530: "That night..."
LINE 531: Taki's memories flood into me. The comet disaster that destroyed an entire
LINE 532: town. The fact that Taki really lived in Tokyo three years in the future. The fact
LINE 533: that, by then, I wasn't anywhere anymore. The night the star fell. Back then, I...
LINE 534: "...I died...?"
LINE 535: L + +
LINE 536: Where do human memories live?
LINE 537: Are they in the synaptic circuitry of the brain? Do retinas and fingertips
LINE 538: hold memories, too? Or is there an invisible, amorphous, mistlike, spiritual
LINE 539: collective somewhere, and that's where the memories reside? Something we'd
LINE 540: call the heart or the mind or the soul. Is it something you can take out and stick
LINE 541: back in, like a memory card with an OS on it?
LINE 542: The asphalt cut out a while back, and I've been pedaling over unpaved
LINE 543: mountain roads. The low sun flickers through the gaps among the trees.
LINE 544: Mitsuha's body is sweating nonstop, and my bangs are plastered to my
LINE 545: forehead. As I pedal, I wipe the hair out of my face along with the sweat.
LINE 546: Mitsuha's soul must be in my body right now. After all, my heart's here, in
LINE 547: hers. But... This is something I've been thinking for a while.
LINE 548: Even now, we're together.
LINE 549: Mitsuha, or at least some fragment of her heart, is still here. For example,
LINE 550: her fingers remember the shape of her uniform. When I put it on, I naturally
LINE 551: know the length of the zipper and the stiffness of the collar. When Mitsuha's
LINE 552: eyes see her friends, I feel relieved and happy. Without even asking, I can tell
LINE 553: who Mitsuha likes and who she's not comfortable around. When I see her
LINE 554: grandma, memories I shouldn't even have rise hazily in my mind, like a
LINE 555: projector with broken focus. Body and memories and emotions are bound
LINE 556: together inseparably.
LINE 557: Taki.
LINE 558: I've been hearing Mitsuha's voice inside this body for a while now.
LINE 559: Taki, Taki.
LINE 560: Her tone is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
LINE 561: with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
LINE 562: The blurry image sharpens. Taki , Mitsuha's calling.
LINE 563: "Don't you remember me? "
LINE 564: And then I recall her memories of that day.
LINE 565: + + +
LINE 566: That day, instead of going to school, Mitsuha got on a train.
LINE 567: She went to a big terminal station, where the Shinkansen to Tokyo stopped.
LINE 568: The local train she took to get there was empty, despite the fact that it was rush
LINE 569: hour, when students were heading to school. Since there were no schools along
LINE 570: the track, everyone who commuted around here drove.
LINE 571: 'Tmgoin' into Tokyo for a bit."
LINE 572: This had been Mitsuha's abrupt announcement to her little sister when they
LINE 573: left the house that morning.
LINE 574: "Huh? Now? Why?!" Yotsuha asks, startled.
LINE 575: "Um... For a date?"
LINE 576: "Wha—?! Sis, you have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!"
LINE 577: "Uh, well... It's not my date." Unsure how to explain herself, Mitsuha
LINE 578: breaks into a run. "I'll be back tonight. Don't worry!"
LINE 579: Gazing at the scenery flying past the window of the bullet train, Mitsuha
LINE 580: wonders:
LINE 581: Why am I crashin ' Okudera-senpai and Takis date? It's not like the three
LINE 582: of us can just hang out together. Besides, I've never been to Tokyo before.
LINE 583: Will I even be able to find Taki? Even if I do, will it bother him that I'm
LINE 584: showin' up out of the blue? Will he be surprised? Maybe he 'll be upset...
LINE 585: With an uncomplicated ease almost inviting disappointment, the Shinkansen
LINE 586: slides into Tokyo. The incredible crowds leave Mitsuha breathless, but she
LINE 587: tries calling my cell. "...Because the unit is out of range or turned off, the
LINE 588: number you are trying to reach is... " She hangs up. Just like the other calls, it
LINE 589: didn't go through.
LINE 590: I'll never find him, Mitsuha thinks.
LINE 591: Still, after staring at the station information board like it's a quiz, she heads
LINE 592: into the city, relying on her vague memories.
LINE 593: But if I do see him...
LINE 594: She rides the Yamanote Line, the city bus, walks, takes another train, then
LINE 595: walks some more.
LINE 596: What 'll I do? It probably will bother him, right? Maybe it 'll be awkward.
LINE 597: Or maybe —
LINE 598: She sees the words Comet Tiamat at Closest Point Tomorrow on a big
LINE 599: outdoor TV screen.
LINE 600: Or, if I do find him, just maybe, will he—?
LINE 601: Tired from walking, she gazes at the sparkling lights of the buildings from a
LINE 602: pedestrian bridge and thinks, almost praying:
LINE 603: If I find Taki, maybe he 'll be just a little bit happy...
LINE 604: She starts walking again, still thinking.
LINE 605: I'll never find him searchin ' randomly like this. I won't, but I know one
LINE 606: thing for sure. If we meet, we 'll know right away. "You 're the one who was in
LINE 607: me. I'm the one who was in you. "
LINE 608: Mitsuha's certain of this, as if it's as simple as two plus two.
LINE 609: The evening sun sinks through the gap between the station platform roofs, as
LINE 610: weak as a dying flashlight.
LINE 611: Mitsuha's feet are sore from all the walking she's done, and she plants
LINE 612: herself on a bench with her legs kicked out in front of her. She stares absently
LINE 613: at the setting sun, which is much paler and less reliable than in Itomori.
LINE 614: A musical chime plays, and a voice announces: "The local train to...
LINE 615: Chiba...is arriving on... Track Four. " A yellow train glides onto the platform.
LINE 616: The cars kick up a warm wind that ruffles her hair. Mitsuha gazes at the train
LINE 617: windows without really seeing them.
LINE 618: Abruptly, her breath catches.
LINE 619: She jumps to her feet as if she's been stung.
LINE 620: He 'd been there, in the window that had just passed in front of her.
LINE 621: Mitsuha breaks into a sprint. The cars have stopped, and she catches up to
LINE 622: the window almost immediately. The evening train is crowded, though, and she
LINE 623: can't find him again from outside. With a sound like a giant exhalation, the
LINE 624: doors open. The car's so tightly packed that the people are practically spilling
LINE 625: out, making Mitsuha shiver. Even so—murmuring "Excuse me" and sweating
LINE 626: behind the knees—she pushes her way into the crowd. With another giant sigh,
LINE 627: the doors close. The train begins moving. Repeating "Excuse me" over and
LINE 628: over, little by little, Mitsuha works her way forward. Then, in front of one boy,
LINE 629: she stops. The sounds around her vanish.
LINE 630: It's me. The middle school "me" from three years ago.
LINE 631: + + +
LINE 632: I can't go any higher on the bike.
LINE 633: No sooner have I had the thought than the front wheel catches on a root, and
LINE 634: I slip.
LINE 635: On reflex, I grab the trunk of a nearby tree. The bike slips out from under
LINE 636: me and tumbles down the slope, hitting the ground about ten feet below with a
LINE 637: huge racket. The wheels are bent all out of shape. "Sorry, Teshigawara," I
LINE 638: mutter softly, and I take off running up the narrow mountain track.
LINE 639: Why did I forget? Why didn't I remember until just now?
LINE 640: As I run, I stare at the memories welling up inside me.
LINE 641: Mitsuha, that day, three years ago, you came to see me—
LINE 642: + +
LINE 643: Taki. Taki, Taki.
LINE 644: For a while now, Mitsuha has been silently rolling my name around on her
LINE 645: tongue. I haven't noticed her at all, even though I'm right in front of her. She
LINE 646: keeps fretting over what tone she should use to address me and what
LINE 647: expression she should wear, so earnestly she seems liable to burst into tears.
LINE 648: Then, forcing a bright smile, she says:
LINE 649: "Taki."
LINE 650: The middle school me is startled hearing my name out of the blue, and I
LINE 651: glance up. We're still about the same height, so her big, vaguely teary eyes are
LINE 652: right in front of me.
LINE 653: "Huh...?"
LINE 654: "Um, do you..."
LINE 655: Smiling desperately, Mitsuha points to herself. I'm bewildered.
LINE 656: "...Huh?"
LINE 657: "Don't you remember me?" asks this stranger, timidly, looking at me
LINE 658: through her lashes.
LINE 659: "Who're you?"
LINE 660: Mitsuha gives a small, breathy shriek, then quickly turns red. She lowers
LINE 661: her eyes, speaking in a voice that's barely audible.
LINE 662: "Oh... I'm sorry..."
LINE 663: The train sways. The passengers all adjust to keep their balance, except for
LINE 664: Mitsuha, who staggers into me. Her hair brushes the tip of my nose, and I catch
LINE 665: the faint scent of shampoo. "I'm sorry," she mumbles again.
LINE 666: Weird girl , thinks middle school me.
LINE 667: Mitsuha's muddled mind races desperately. But you're Taki, so why...? For
LINE 668: both of us, time passes awkwardly.
LINE 669: "The next station is ...Yotsuya. " The announcement offers Mitsuha a bit of
LINE 670: relief. At the same time, though, she feels unbearably sad. Still, she can't stay
LINE 671: here any longer. The doors open, and she moves with the rest of the crowd to
LINE 672: exit the train.
LINE 673: Watching her receding back, I suddenly think, Maybe this weird girl is
LINE 674: somebody I should know. This inexplicable, intense impulse drives me to call
LINE 675: out.
LINE 676: "'Scuse me! What's your name?"
LINE 677: Mitsuha turns back, but the waves of disembarking passengers push her
LINE 678: farther away. Hurriedly, she undoes the braided cord tying back her hair. She
LINE 679: holds it out to me and shouts:
LINE 680: "Mitsuha!"
LINE 681: Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray of evening
LINE 682: sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that color tight.
LINE 683: "My name is Mitsuha!"
LINE 684: ^ +
LINE 685: That day, three years ago, you came to see me.
LINE 686: Finally, I know.
LINE 687: A girl I didn't recognize spoke to me on the train once. To me, that was all
LINE 688: it'd been, and I completely forgot about it. But Mitsuha had come to Tokyo
LINE 689: carrying the weight of all those feelings, had been hurt badly, gone back to her
LINE 690: own town, and cut her hair.
LINE 691: There's a lump in my throat. Still, there's nothing I can do about it now, so I
LINE 692: just keep running, hell for leather. My (Mitsuha's) face and body are smeared
LINE 693: with sweat and dirt. The next thing I know, the trees have ended, and I'm in a
LINE 694: rocky, mossy area, with clouds like a golden carpet below me.
LINE 695: I've finally reached the peak.
LINE 696: I suck in a huge chestful of cold air. Then, as if I'm expelling all my
LINE 697: emotions from the pit of my stomach, I yell at the top of my lungs.
LINE 698: "Mitsuhaaaa!"
LINE 699: I hear a voice.
LINE 700: I lift my head. I stand, looking around.
LINE 701: I'm up on the rocky area surrounding the body of the god's basin. The
LINE 702: evening sun is almost gone, and all the shadows are stretched and elongated.
LINE 703: The world is divided sharply into light and darkness, but there's no one
LINE 704: around.
LINE 705: ".. .Taki?" I murmur.
LINE 706: I draw in a deep breath of cold air. Then I shout, using Taki's throat:
LINE 707: "Takiiii!"
LINE 708: I hear it.
LINE 709: She's here. Mitsuha is here.
LINE 710: I set off running, climbing the slope up to the mountain's peak.
LINE 711: I do a complete 360 scan of the area, but no one's there... She has to be
LINE 712: here, though. I feel it in my core.
LINE 713: "Mitsuhaaa! You're here, aren't you? In my body!"
LINE 714: It's Taki!
LINE 715: I'm sure of it. I shout a question into the empty sky:
LINE 716: "Taki! Taki, where are you?! I can hear you, but I can't—!"
LINE 717: I start sprinting around the rim of the basin.
LINE 718: I can hear a voice. Just a voice.
LINE 719: I don't really know whether it—my voice, Mitsuha's voice—is actually
LINE 720: creating sound or whether it's just echoing in something like my soul. After all,
LINE 721: even if we're in the same place, we must still be three years apart.
LINE 722: "Mitsuha, where are you?!"
LINE 723: Even so, I shout. I can't not shout. I sprint around the edge of the basin with
LINE 724: everything I've got. If I do—
LINE 725: If I do, I'll catch up to Taki. I run, spurred on by that delusion.
LINE 726: "Oh!"
LINE 727: Crying out in spite of myself, I stop.
LINE 728: I stop, hastily looking back.
LINE 729: Just now, I'm positive I passed her.
LINE 730: There's a warm presence in front of me. My heart is leaping in my chest.
LINE 731: I can't see him, but I know Taki's here, very close to me.
LINE 732: My heart is racing.
LINE 733: He's here. I reach out my hand.
LINE 734: She's here. I reach out my hand.
LINE 735: .. .But my fingers touch nothing.
LINE 736: "Mitsuha?"
LINE 737: I wait for a response. Nobody answers.
LINE 738: It's no good, then? We can't meet? One more time, I look around. I'm
LINE 739: standing stock-still, up on the mountain, all alone.
LINE 740: At my wits' end, I lower my head and let out a long, thin breath.
LINE 741: The wind blows gently, softly lifting my hair. My sweat has dried
LINE 742: completely. Sensing a sudden drop in the temperature, I glance at the evening
LINE 743: sun. While I was distracted, it slipped below the clouds. Released from direct
LINE 744: sunlight, light and shadow melt together, and the world's outlines grow soft and
LINE 745: vague. The sky is still bright, but the Earth is enveloped in pale shadows. The
LINE 746: air is filled with pink, indirect light.
LINE 747: That's right. There were names for this time of day. Twilight, tasogare. The
LINE 748: time when the outlines blur, when you might encounter something not of this
LINE 749: world. I murmur its old name.
LINE 750: Half-light.
LINE 751: Our voices overlap.
LINE 752: It can't be.
LINE 753: Slowly, I shift my gaze away from the clouds to the space right in front of
LINE 754: me.
LINE 755: Mitsuha's there.
LINE 756: She's watching me, eyes wide and round, mouth hanging open.
LINE 757: That lame expression strikes me as funny and lovable. The emotion is
LINE 758: stronger than my surprise, and, slowly, I start to smile.
LINE 759: "Mitsuha."
LINE 760: When I call to her, Mitsuha's eyes rapidly fill with tears.
LINE 761: ".. .Taki? Taki? Taki? Taki?"
LINE 762: As she repeats herself like an idiot, her hands find my arms. Her fingers
LINE 763: tighten, squeezing.
LINE 764: "Taki, you're here for real!"
LINE 765: Her voice sounds hoarse and tight. Big tears roll down her cheeks.
LINE 766: We've finally met. Really met. We're facing each other, Mitsuha as
LINE 767: Mitsuha, me as myself, in our own bodies. I feel deeply relieved. A sense of
LINE 768: profound peace wells up inside me, as if, after being abroad for a long time in
LINE 769: a country where I didn't know the language, I've finally come home. A calm
LINE 770: joy fills me.
LINE 771: Mitsuha just keeps sobbing.
LINE 772: "I came to see you," I tell her.
LINE 773: Her tears are as clear and round as little marbles.
LINE 774: I smile and keep going. "Seriously, it was a rough trip! You're way out
LINE 775: here."
LINE 776: That's right: way, way out here. Somewhere even the time is different.
LINE 777: Mitsuha looks at me, blinking.
LINE 778: "Huh? But... How? Back then, I..."
LINE 779: "I drank the sake you made."
LINE 780: As I tell her, remembering how much I've gone through for this, Mitsuha's
LINE 781: tears stop dead.
LINE 782: "Huh...?"
LINE 783: She's speechless. Well, sure she is. Anybody would be really moved by
LINE 784: that, right?
LINE 785: "Y...y..."
LINE 786: Slowly, Mitsuha backs away from me... Hmm?
LINE 787: "Y.. .you drank that?!"
LINE 788: "Huh?"
LINE 789: "Idiot! Pervert!"
LINE 790: "Huh—? Wha...?!"
LINE 791: Her face is bright red. Apparently, she's mad. Wait, is that something to get
LINE 792: mad about?!
LINE 793: "Oh, and—! You touched my chest, didn't you?!"
LINE 794: "What?!" I'm completely rattled. "H-how do you know about...?"
LINE 795: "Yotsuha saw you!" Mitsuha plants her hands on her hips, talking as though
LINE 796: she's scolding a child.
LINE 797: "Uh, yeah, sorry... I just..." Teh! Rotten little blabbermouth. My palms are
LINE 798: getting sweaty. An excuse. I've gotta give her an excuse. On the spur of the
LINE 799: moment, I blurt out, "Once! It was just once!"
LINE 800: Like that's any kind of excuse! I'm a moron!
LINE 801: "... Just once? Hmm..."
LINE 802: Huh? She's considering it. So "just once" is okay? I might actually get
LINE 803: through this. However, as if correcting herself, Mitsuha's eyebrows come
LINE 804: down.
LINE 805: "No, it's the same no matter how many times you do it! Idiot!"
LINE 806: So it's not going to work. Giving up, I clap my hands together and duck my
LINE 807: head in apology. "Sorry!" I really can't tell her that I actually felt 'em up every
LINE 808: time.
LINE 809: "Oh, that's..."
LINE 810: Mitsuha's expression changes abruptly. She points at my right hand in
LINE 811: surprise. I glance at my wrist.
LINE 812: "Oh, yeah. This."
LINE 813: It's the braided cord. The one she gave me three years ago. I undo the little
LINE 814: metal fastener that keeps it in place and unwind it from my wrist, talking to
LINE 815: Mitsuha as I work.
LINE 816: "Listen, don't come visit me before we meet. How was I supposed to know
LINE 817: it was you?" I hand the cord to Mitsuha. "Here." Remembering what she felt on
LINE 818: that train, a softness fills my chest. "I've had it for three years. This time, you
LINE 819: hang on to it."
LINE 820: Mitsuha looks up from the cord in her hands and smiles happily. "Uh-huh!"
LINE 821: When she smiles— I hadn't noticed before, but it's like the whole world is
LINE 822: happy right along with her.
LINE 823: Mitsuha wraps the cord around her head vertically, like a headband, and
LINE 824: ties it into a bow over her left ear.
LINE 825: "How's this?" She blushes, looking up at me through her lashes. The
LINE 826: braided cord bounces at the side of her bob, like a ribbon.
LINE 827: "Uh..."
LINE 828: It doesn't really work, I think. It's sort of little-kiddish. And she didn't
LINE 829: have to chop off that much hair. First she shows up without asking, then she
LINE 830: gets traumatized for no reason... I like long black hair, all right?
LINE 831: That's my immediate reaction. In cases like this, though, compliments are
LINE 832: the best move. Even I know that. Even the Conversation skills for the person
LINE 833: who's never, ever been the tiniest bit popular! link Mitsuha sent me said it
LINE 834: was always safe to compliment women.
LINE 835: ".. .Well, it's not bad."
LINE 836: "Wha—?!" Mitsuha's expression immediately clouds over. Huh?
LINE 837: "You don't think it looks good on me!"
LINE 838: "Huh?!" How'd she know?!
LINE 839: "Ha...ha-ha... Sorry."
LINE 840: "Honestly! You're such a...!"
LINE 841: She turns her face away, thoroughly disgusted. What is this? Talking to girls
LINE 842: is friggin' impossible...
LINE 843: Then Mitsuha bursts out laughing. She holds her sides, giggling. What's
LINE 844: with her, anyway? Crying and getting mad and laughing... Still, watching her,
LINE 845: the urge starts building inside me, too. I look down, put a hand over my face,
LINE 846: and chuckle. Mitsuha's cracking up right along with me. For some reason,
LINE 847: we've started enjoying ourselves. We laugh out loud together. In our corner of
LINE 848: the softly shining, half-lit world, we giggle and titter like little kids.
LINE 849: Bit by bit, the temperature is falling. Little by little, the light is fading.
LINE 850: "Mitsuha."
LINE 851: I suddenly remember the way I felt when I was a kid, when I'd played my
LINE 852: heart out after school, wanting to stay with my friends for hours and hours
LINE 853: longer but knowing it was almost time to go home.
LINE 854: "You've still got things you need to do. Listen."
LINE 855: I outline the plan for her that I'd hatched with Teshigawara and Saya. As
LINE 856: she listens, Mitsuha nods seriously, and I realize she remembers that the star
LINE 857: fell, that the town vanished. That she died once. For her, tonight is a
LINE 858: reenactment.
LINE 859: "It's here..."
LINE 860: Mitsuha looks up at the sky, and as she whispers, her voice trembles
LINE 861: slightly. I follow her gaze. In the western sky, which is turning a deep, dark
LINE 862: blue, the shape of long-tailed Comet Tiamat is faintly visible.
LINE 863: "It's all right. You'll make it." I say this definitively, as much to convince
LINE 864: myself as anything.
LINE 865: "Yes, I'll try... Oh, half-light's already—"
LINE 866: Before I know it, Mitsuha's turned the color of pale shadows, too.
LINE 867: "—It's already over," I finish. The last traces of the evening sun are fading
LINE 868: from the sky. Night will be here soon. As if to shove down the anxiety suddenly
LINE 869: amassing inside me, I force a smile and speak cheerfully. "Hey, Mitsuha. So
LINE 870: we don't forget each other after we wake up..." I take a felt-tip pen from my
LINE 871: pocket. I catch Mitsuha's right hand, then write on her palm "Let's write down
LINE 872: our names. Here."
LINE 873: I give the pen to Mitsuha.
LINE 874: She breaks into a smile. It's like watching a flower bloom. She takes my
LINE 875: right hand and sets the tip of the pen against it.
LINE 876: Tunk.
LINE 877: There's a tiny, hard noise by my feet. I look down, and there's the pen on
LINE 878: the ground.
LINE 879: "Huh?" I raise my head.
LINE 880: There's nobody in front of me.
LINE 881: "What...?"
LINE 882: I turn this way and that.
LINE 883: "Mitsuha? Hey, Mitsuha?"
LINE 884: I call louder. No response. Unnerved, I pace the area. The shadows are
LINE 885: sinking into blue-black darkness. Below me are leaden, featureless clouds, and
LINE 886: in the gloom below them, I can just make out gourd-shaped Itomori Lake.
LINE 887: Mitsuha's gone.
LINE 888: Night is here.
LINE 889: I'm back in my own body, three years in the fixture.
LINE 890: I look at my right hand. There's no braided cord on my wrist now. On my
LINE 891: palm, there's just one thin, short, half-drawn line. I touch it gently.
LINE 892: ".. .1 was going to tell you..I mutter quietly to the line. "No matter where
LINE 893: in the world you are, I'll find you again. I swear."
LINE 894: Up in the sky, the comet's nowhere to be seen, and a few stars are beginning
LINE 895: to twinkle.
LINE 896: "Your name is Mitsuha."
LINE 897: I close my eyes, making sure of my memories, turning them into something I
LINE 898: can count on.
LINE 899: "It's okay. I remember!"
LINE 900: Confidence deepening, I open my eyes again. There's a white half-moon in
LINE 901: the distant horizon.
LINE 902: "Mitsuha, Mitsuha... Mitsuha, Misua, Misua. Your name is Misua!"
LINE 903: I'm yelling her name at the half-moon.
LINE 904: "Your name is...!"
LINE 905: Abruptly, the outline of the word I meant to utter blurs.
LINE 906: I quickly snatch up the pen and write the first letter of her name on my
LINE 907: palm... Or I try to.
LINE 908: 66
LINE 909: After a single line, my hand stops. The tip of the pen starts to tremble. I
LINE 910: want to make it stop shaking and grip it tight. I try stabbing it in like a needle,
LINE 911: to carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an
LINE 912: inch. My lips move.
LINE 913: "...Who are you?"
LINE 914: The pen falls from my hand.
LINE 915: They're vanishing. Your name. Your memories.
LINE 916: "Why did I come here?"
LINE 917: I want to tether them to me somehow, to scrape the fragments of memory
LINE 918: together, so I say them aloud.
LINE 919: "Her... I came to see her! I came to save her! I wanted her to live!"
LINE 920: It's disappearing. Something so precious to me is disappearing.
LINE 921: "Who are you? Who are you, who are you, who are you...?"
LINE 922: Slipping away. Even the emotions I know I felt are leaving me.
LINE 923: "Somebody important, somebody I can't forget, somebody I didn't want to
LINE 924: forget!"
LINE 925: Everything's vanishing, sorrow and love alike. I don't even know why I'm
LINE 926: crying now. My emotions are disintegrating, crumbling like a sand castle.
LINE 927: "Who are you, who are you, who...?"
LINE 928: After the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it's
LINE 929: loneliness. In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all
LINE 930: that stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced
LINE 931: me to take.
LINE 932: Fine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is
LINE 933: loneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I
LINE 934: have, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet
LINE 935: again, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting
LINE 936: resolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll
LINE 937: forget even the fact that I've forgotten something.
LINE 938: And so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky
LINE 939: one last time:
LINE 940: "What's your name?"
LINE 941: The cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains. Asking its
LINE 942: question of the void over and over, it diminishes, bit by bit.
LINE 943: Finally, silence descends.
