LINE 1: Chapter Seven
LINE 2: Struggle. Magnificently
LINE 3: I run.
LINE 4: I'm sprinting down a dark deer track, repeating his name again and again.
LINE 5: Taki, Taki, Taki.
LINE 6: It's all right. I remember. I'll never forget.
LINE 7: At last, through the gaps in the trees, I begin catching glimpses of the lights
LINE 8: of Itomori. The wind carries faint, scattered snatches of festival music to me.
LINE 9: Taki, Tald, Taki.
LINE 10: When I look up at the sky, Comet Tiamat is there, shining brighter than the
LINE 11: moon, its long tail trailing behind it. The terror nearly makes me recoil, but I
LINE 12: scream his name and stomp it down.
LINE 13: Your name is Tald!
LINE 14: I hear the sound of a moped, and when I raise my head, a headlight comes
LINE 15: up over the slope and shines right in my eyes.
LINE 16: "Tesshi!" I shout, running up to it.
LINE 17: "Mitsuha! Wfiere the heck you been?!"
LINE 18: He sounds like he's scolding me, but I really can't explain. Tesshi's in his
LINE 19: school uniform with the sleeves rolled up, and he's wearing a helmet with a
LINE 20: big light attached to it, like he's going spelunking. I give him Taki's message.
LINE 21: "He said he broke your bike, and he's sorry."
LINE 22: "Huh? Who did?"
LINE 23: "I did!"
LINE 24: Tesshi's eyebrows furrow, but he shuts off the moped's engine and turns on
LINE 25: his helmet light without a word. He breaks into a run. "You better gimme the
LINE 26: whole story later!" he says in a loud, rough voice.
LINE 27: Itomori Substation—Company-Owned Land: Keep Out, says the plate on
LINE 28: the chain-link fence. Beyond it, transformers and steel towers form a
LINE 29: complicated silhouette. It's an unmanned facility, and the only lights I can see
LINE 30: are the red lamps on machinery here and there.
LINE 31: "That thing's comm' down? For real?!" Tesshi asks, looking up at the sky.
LINE 32: We're in front of the substation's chain-link fence, gazing at the glittering
LINE 33: comet.
LINE 34: "It will! I saw it happen!"
LINE 35: As I speak, I look him straight in the eye. We've got two hours until it falls.
LINE 36: There's no time to explain.
LINE 37: For a moment, Tesshi looks dubious. Then, with a sharp "Hah!" he grins.
LINE 38: His smile looks like something he's mustered out of sheer desperation. "You
LINE 39: saw it, huh?! Then I guess we've gotta do this!"
LINE 40: Tesshi practically rips opens his sports bag. It's stuffed with tubes that look
LINE 41: like race batons wrapped in brown paper: water-gel explosives. I gulp. Tesshi
LINE 42: takes out a big bolt cutter, sets its blades against the chain wrapped around the
LINE 43: substation gate, and says, "Mitsuha. If we do this, there's no goin' back."
LINE 44: "Please. I'll take all the responsibility."
LINE 45: "Moron! That ain't what I'm askin'!" Tesshi sounds angry, and for some
LINE 46: reason, he's blushing a bit. "Well, we're both criminals now!"
LINE 47: He cuts the chain, and the loud rattle shatters the darkness.
LINE 48: "When the power in town goes out, the school should switch over to the
LINE 49: emergency generator right away! You'll be able to use the broadcastin'
LINE 50: equipment then!"
LINE 51: Tesshi shouts in the direction of the smartphone. He's driving the moped,
LINE 52: and I'm behind him, holding the phone up to his mouth. Almost no cars pass us,
LINE 53: and we're starting to see the lights of scattered houses along the dark
LINE 54: prefectural road. We're heading for an area between the slopes of the
LINE 55: mountains, where the lights are concentrated: Miyamizu Shrine, the site of the
LINE 56: autumn festival. Out of nowhere, I feel an odd nostalgia, as if I've come back
LINE 57: home after a long time away.
LINE 58: "Mitsuha, she wants to talk to you."
LINE 59: "Hello? Saya?!" I put the smartphone to my own ear.
LINE 60: "Waaaaaah, Mitsuhaaaa!" Saya sounds like she's in tears. "C'mon, do I
LINE 61: really have to do this?!"
LINE 62: Her anxious voice sends a pang through my heart. If I were in her shoes, I'd
LINE 63: probably be crying, too. Even sneaking by yourself into the broadcasting room
LINE 64: at night is something you'd do only for a friend.
LINE 65: "Saya, I'm sorry, but Embeggin' you! Please!" At this point, that's all I can
LINE 66: say. "I'll never ask you for anythin' else as long as I live, but if we don't do
LINE 67: this, a lot of people are gonna die! Once you start the announcement, repeat it
LINE 68: for as long as you can!"
LINE 69: There's no response. All I can hear from the receiver are little muffled
LINE 70: sniffling noises.
LINE 71: "Saya? Saya!"
LINE 72: I start getting nervous.
LINE 73: Abruptly, I hear a tiny voice. "Okay! Agh, I don't even care anymore! You
LINE 74: tell Tesshi he better buy me somethin', too!"
LINE 75: "What'd she say?"
LINE 76: Putting the smartphone in my skirt pocket, I yell back loud enough to be
LINE 77: heard over the moped's engine. "That you better buy her somethin', too!"
LINE 78: "Awright, let's do this!"
LINE 79: Tesshi shouts determinedly, as if trying to suppress something, and just then,
LINE 80: behind us, there's a bang like a big firework bursting.
LINE 81: We stop the moped and look back. Two, three. One more. The explosions
LINE 82: echo one after another, and hallway up the mountain—where we were just a
LINE 83: few minutes ago—thick black smoke is rising. In slow motion, an enormous
LINE 84: transmission tower begins tilting.
LINE 85: "Tesshi...!"
LINE 86: My voice quavers.
LINE 87: "Ha-ha!"
LINE 88: Tesshi's breath is shaky, too. It sounds like a laugh.
LINE 89: There's an even bigger explosion, and the lights of the town instantly go
LINE 90: dark.
LINE 91: "Hey," Tesshi intones, sounding kind of dazed.
LINE 92: "The power's out," I say, stating the obvious.
LINE 93: It worked. We did it.
LINE 94: Suddenly, sirens well up, beginning to wail.
LINE 95: 000OOOOOOOO000000...!
LINE 96: The earsplitting noise reverberates from speakers all over town. It's an
LINE 97: ominous sound, like a giant's scream, and it ricochets off the mountains,
LINE 98: pervading the area.
LINE 99: It's Saya. She's hijacked the wireless disaster prevention system
LINE 100: We exchange wordless nods, then straddle the moped again. As we race
LINE 101: toward the shrine, the speakers broadcasting Saya's voice spur us on. Slowly,
LINE 102: calmly, as if her earlier tearful cries were fake, she delivers the message we
LINE 103: came up with:
LINE 104: "This is Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at Itomori Substation.
LINE 105: There is a danger of further explosions and forest fires."
LINE 106: Tesshi's moped goes off the prefectural road and climbs up a narrow
LINE 107: mountain track. It's the gentler slope up to the shrine—this way, we can take
LINE 108: the moped all the way to the back of the main building and avoid the stone
LINE 109: stairs on the shrine approach. The seat shakes violently, and I cling to Tesshi's
LINE 110: back as I listen to Saya's voice booming through the town. She sounds exactly
LINE 111: like her big sister. Nobody would suspect this isn't a broadcast from the town
LINE 112: hall.
LINE 113: "People in the following districts are requested to evacuate to Itomori
LINE 114: High School immediately. Kadoiri District, Sakagami District, Miyamori
LINE 115: District, Oyazawa District..."
LINE 116: "This's it. C'mon, Mitsuha!"
LINE 117: "Right!"
LINE 118: We leap off the moped and run down the set of wooden steps up the slope
LINE 119: of the mountain behind the shrine. From between the trees, I can see the roofs
LINE 120: of the long rows of stalls set up on the shrine grounds and the people milling
LINE 121: around among them, like fish crowded too closely in a dark tank. As we run,
LINE 122: we take off our helmets and throw them away.
LINE 123: "I repeat: This is Itomori Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at the
LINE 124: substation. There is a danger of further explosions and forest fires..."
LINE 125: When we hit the bottom of the stairs, we're behind the main shrine building.
LINE 126: The silhouettes of the people gathered for the festival are just ahead, and I hear
LINE 127: an uneasy murmur. Tesshi and I dash into their midst as if we're racing each
LINE 128: other, yelling.
LINE 129: "Ruuun! A forest fire's cornin'! This place ain't safe!"
LINE 130: Tesshi's voice is unbelievably loud, like he's using a megaphone. I shout,
LINE 131: too, determined not to be outdone. "Please run! There's a forest fire! Run!" We
LINE 132: emerge in the very center of the grounds.
LINE 133: "Yeah, they said there really is a forest fire!"
LINE 134: "C'mon, let's get outta here."
LINE 135: "We're walkin' all the way to the high school?"
LINE 136: The broadcast set the evacuation in motion, and our shouts are pushing it
LINE 137: along. Men and women in traditional wear, children, and old people holding
LINE 138: their grandkids' hands all begin filing toward the shrine gate at the exit. I'm
LINE 139: relieved. If things go on like this, we'll make it for sure. It's all thanks to
LINE 140: him... "Him"?
LINE 141: "Mitsuha!"
LINE 142: Tesshi calls my name sharply. I look up at him.
LINE 143: "This ain't good!"
LINE 144: Following his gaze around us, I see lots of people sitting down and taking it
LINE 145: easy by the stalls or standing, idly talking. They're even smoking cigarettes or
LINE 146: drinking, chatting away and enjoying the evening.
LINE 147: "There's no way we're movin' all these folks unless an actual forest fire
LINE 148: comes through! We have to get them to send out the fire brigade and direct the
LINE 149: evacuation. You get to the town hall, and this time make sure the mayor..."
LINE 150: Tesshi's flustered voice is right above my head, but it sounds terribly far
LINE 151: away... Him?
LINE 152: "Hey. Mitsuha? What's up?"
LINE 153: "...Tesshi, listen, what'll I do?"
LINE 154: My mind isn't working, and before I know it, I'm pleading to Tesshi.
LINE 155: "His name... I can't remember his name!"
LINE 156: Tesshi's face twists with worry. Suddenly, he yells at me. "Who the hell
LINE 157: cares, you idiot?! Look around! You started all this!"
LINE 158: He's glaring at me, furious. Belatedly, I notice that Saya's call to "Please
LINE 159: evacuate to Itomori High School" is now erratic, as if she's about to burst
LINE 160: into tears.
LINE 161: "Mitsuha, go !" Tesshi gives a heartrending yell, practically begging this
LINE 162: time. "Go talk your dad around!"
LINE 163: My spine straightens as though he's slapped me across the face.
LINE 164: "...Right!"
LINE 165: I nod as firmly as I can, then bolt into a sprint, trying to shake myself free.
LINE 166: Behind me, I hear Tesshi scream again. "I said run, y'all! Get to the high
LINE 167: school!"
LINE 168: Saya's voice echoes all over town. "There is a danger of forest fires.
LINE 169: Please evacuate to Itomori High School." I push my way through the
LINE 170: lumbering crowd, under the shrine gate, down the stone stairs on the shrine
LINE 171: approach.
LINE 172: "You started all this," Tesshi'd said. He's right: This is something I—we—
LINE 173: started. Still running, I glance at the comet overhead. With the lights on the
LINE 174: ground extinguished, the comet's even brighter. Its long tail streams over the
LINE 175: clouds. It's scattering shining scales like a giant moth. I'm not letting you get
LINE 176: your way , I think, as if challenging it to a fight.
LINE 177: It's all right. You'll make it.
LINE 178: Somebody once told me that with conviction. I repeat the words silently to
LINE 179: myself.
LINE 180: + + +
LINE 181: It was early autumn, and I was still in middle school.
LINE 182: I'd finally gotten used to living with just my dad, and after finishing a
LINE 183: dinner that we'd both worked hard to make (and still hadn't been all that
LINE 184: good), I was drinking tea and eating an apple while Dad enjoyed a beer.
LINE 185: That day, the news about the comet's closest approach had pretty much
LINE 186: taken over the TV I wasn't all that interested in stars or the cosmos, but I did
LINE 187: find it kind of amazing how the universe is actually overflowing with
LINE 188: phenomena that exist on a completely different scale from humans, like a solar
LINE 189: orbit that lasts twelve hundred years or an orbital radius over 10.4 billion
LINE 190: miles. As impressions went, it was dumb. Still, it struck me as so awesome
LINE 191: that it made me shiver and, at the same time, so frightening it set my heart
LINE 192: trembling as well.
LINE 193: "Look!"
LINE 194: Suddenly, the announcer who'd been delivering commentary yelled in
LINE 195: excitement.
LINE 196: "The comet appears to have split in two. Around it are...what seem to be
LINE 197: countless shooting stars."
LINE 198: When the camera zoomed in, the comet really had forked above the
LINE 199: background of Tokyo skyscrapers. Thin lines like a meteor shower appeared
LINE 200: and disappeared at its tip. There was a delicate, almost artificial beauty about
LINE 201: it, and my eyes went wide.
LINE 202: + +
LINE 203: Abruptly, the wireless broadcast is interrupted by the click of an opening door.
LINE 204: I hear a short shriek from Saya, and then several familiar male voices
LINE 205: emerge from the speakers.
LINE 206: "Kid, what are you doin'?!"
LINE 207: "Hurry, shut it off!"
LINE 208: There's a clatter like a chair falling over, and then the wireless broadcast
LINE 209: cuts off with a brief burst of shrill feedback.
LINE 210: "Saya...!" I stop, calling her name involuntarily.
LINE 211: The teachers caught her. Large beads of sweat pop out as if they've just
LINE 212: remembered their jobs, falling to the asphalt with audible drips. I'm on the
LINE 213: road that circles around the lake, the one that goes to the town hall and the high
LINE 214: school, and I start hearing bewildered voices from several evacuees.
LINE 215: "What? What's goin' on?"
LINE 216: "Huh? Was there some sort of trouble?"
LINE 217: "What about the evacuation?"
LINE 218: Oh no. A moment later, a voice booms from the wireless speakers again.
LINE 219: "This is Itomori Town Hall."
LINE 220: It's not Saya or her big sister. It's the middle-aged guy in charge of Town
LINE 221: Hall broadcasts, someone I hear every once in a while.
LINE 222: "We are currently looking into the circumstances surrounding the
LINE 223: accident. We request that all residents refrain from panicking. Please stay
LINE 224: where you are and wait for further instructions."
LINE 225: I lurch forward again.
LINE 226: They figured out where the broadcast was coming from, and the town hall
LINE 227: contacted the school. Saya's going to get grilled by the teachers. Tesshi will be
LINE 228: in big trouble, too, if this keeps up.
LINE 229: "I repeat: Do not panic. Stay where you are and wait for further
LINE 230: instructions."
LINE 231: They can't stay where they are! I have to make them stop this broadcast!
LINE 232: I leave the prefectural road, plunging from the gap in the asphalt onto a
LINE 233: slope that's overgrown with brush. It's a shortcut to the town hall. The thorns
LINE 234: on the bushes scrape and sting my bare legs. A spiderweb clings to my face,
LINE 235: and little winged bugs get into my mouth.
LINE 236: Finally, I hit the bottom of the slope and run out onto asphalt again. I can't
LINE 237: see anyone around me. There's only the voice from the wireless broadcast,
LINE 238: issuing orders to stay put. As I run, I spit out the saliva that's pooled in my
LINE 239: mouth, wiping my sweaty, tear-streaked, cobweb-sticky face with my sleeve.
LINE 240: My legs have gone watery, and I stagger. Even then, I keep running. I'm going
LINE 241: downhill, and I'm not losing speed. I'm on a gentle curve, and it's bringing me
LINE 242: closer to the guardrail. Below it is the incline down to the lake.
LINE 243: "...Huh?!"
LINE 244: A feeling that something's wrong makes me look in that direction. The lake
LINE 245: shines faintly. I strain my eyes.
LINE 246: No, it isn't the water glowing. Its calm surface is reflecting the sky. Like a
LINE 247: mirror, the lake reveals two shining tails... Two? I tilt my head to the sky.
LINE 248: Oh, the comet— It's finally...
LINE 249: "...It split!"
LINE 250: + + +
LINE 251: I was channel surfing. Every station jabbered excitedly about the unexpected
LINE 252: astronomy show.
LINE 253: "The comet has definitely split in two."
LINE 254: "This wasn't predicted beforehand, correct?"
LINE 255: "Still, what an extraordinarily fantastic sight..."
LINE 256: "Is it safe to conclude that the nucleus of the comet has divided?"
LINE 257: "The tidal forces don't seem to have surpassed the Roche limit, so it's
LINE 258: possible that an abnormality of some kind occurred within the comet itself—"
LINE 259: "As of yet, the National Astronomical Observatory has issued no
LINE 260: statement..
LINE 261: "A similar case occurred in 1994, when Comet Shoemaker-Levy fell into
LINE 262: Jupiter. On that occasion, it split into at least twenty-one fragments..
LINE 263: "Do you suppose it's dangerous?"
LINE 264: "Comets are masses of ice, so we believe it will melt before it reaches
LINE 265: Earth's surface. Even if it does become a meteorite, in terms of probability, the
LINE 266: likelihood that it will fall on an inhabited area is extremely low..."
LINE 267: "It's difficult to predict the trajectories of the fragments in real time—"
LINE 268: "The fact that we're witnessing such a magnificent astronomical
LINE 269: phenomenon, combined with the fact that it happens to be nighttime in Japan,
LINE 270: may be the sort of good fortune that comes only once in a thousand years for
LINE 271: those of us who are alive in this era—"
LINE 272: "I'm gonna go look!" I told my dad.
LINE 273: Without even thinking about it, I jumped up from my chair and rushed down
LINE 274: the building's stairs.
LINE 275: From a hill in the neighborhood, I watched the night sky.
LINE 276: It held innumerable sparkling lights, as if another Tokyo had been layered
LINE 277: over the sky. It was like a scene from a dream, a view that was simply, utterly
LINE 278: beautiful.
LINE 279: + T +
LINE 280: The comet, split in two, brings my own solitude into stark relief as I race
LINE 281: through the blacked-out town like a lost child.
LINE 282: Who, who? Who is he?
LINE 283: Without taking my eyes off the comet, running as if I'm perpetually falling, I
LINE 284: desperately try to think.
LINE 285: Someone important. Someone I can't forget. Someone I didn't want to
LINE 286: forget.
LINE 287: It's not much farther to Town Hall. Not much longer until that comet
LINE 288: becomes a meteorite.
LINE 289: Who? Who? Who are you?
LINE 290: I summon the very last of my strength and pick up speed.
LINE 291: —What's your name?
LINE 292: "Aah!" I cry out automatically.
LINE 293: My toe caught in a pit in the asphalt, and in the moment I realize I'm falling,
LINE 294: the ground is already imminent. There's a shock, a blow to the face. My body
LINE 295: tumbles limply. Stabbing pain spreads through me. My field of vision spins,
LINE 296: and my consciousness goes black.
LINE 297: .But.
LINE 298: Your voice reaches me.
LINE 299: "So we don't forget each other after we wake up."
LINE 300: That's what you said then, and...
LINE 301: "Let's write down our names."
LINE 302: You wrote on my hand.
LINE 303: On the ground, I open my eyes.
LINE 304: My pain-blurred vision finds my clenched right hand. I open the fingers, or
LINE 305: try to. They're stiff and wooden. Even so, little by little, I uncurl them.
LINE 306: There are letters there. I strain my eyes.
LINE 307: I love you
LINE 308: For a moment, I stop breathing. I try to stand. My muscles feel weak, and it
LINE 309: takes a long time. Even so, I manage to get myself back on my feet, standing on
LINE 310: the asphalt. Then I look at my palm one more time. All that's written there, in
LINE 311: nostalgic handwriting I've seen somewhere before, are the words I love you.
LINE 312: ...But this isn't... Tears spill over, and my vision blurs again. Something
LINE 313: like a warm wave spreads through me, like a spring that's welled up with the
LINE 314: tears. Still crying, I laugh, talking to you.
LINE 315: This doesn't tell me your name.
LINE 316: Then one more time, I surge forward with all my might.
LINE 317: I'm not afraid of anything now. I'm not scared of anyone. I'm not lonely
LINE 318: anymore.
LINE 319: I finally understand.
LINE 320: I'm in love. We're in love.
LINE 321: That means we'll meet again. I'm sure of it.
LINE 322: And so I'll live.
LINE 323: I'll survive this.
LINE 324: No matter what happens, even if the stars fall, I will live.
LINE 325: + + +
LINE 326: Right up until it happened, no one managed to predict that the comet's nucleus
LINE 327: would shatter near Earth, or that there was a huge rocky mass buried in its ice-
LINE 328: covered core.
LINE 329: The town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The strike
LINE 330: occurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, where the
LINE 331: festival was being held.
LINE 332: The meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The
LINE 333: crater formed by the impact was nearly half a mile across. Water from the lake
LINE 334: beside it rushed in, swallowing the remains of the town. Itomori became the
LINE 335: site of the worst meteorite disaster in human history.
LINE 336: I remember these things as I look down over gourd-shaped New Itomori
LINE 337: Lake. It reflects the sun in the midst of a faint morning haze, endlessly serene.
LINE 338: It's hard to imagine that three years ago it was the site of such a tragedy. I can't
LINE 339: quite believe that the comet I saw in the sky over Tokyo did this.
LINE 340: I'm standing on a rock-littered mountain peak, all alone.
LINE 341: I was here when I woke up.
LINE 342: For no real reason, I look at my right hand. There's a single, half-drawn
LINE 343: line on my palm
LINE 344: "What is this...?" I mutter quietly.
LINE 345: "What was I doing way out here?"
