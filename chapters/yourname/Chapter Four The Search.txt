LINE 1: Chapter Four
LINE 2: he Search
LINE 3: I move my pencil tirelessly.
LINE 4: Carbon particles blend into the paper fibers, lines accumulate, and the
LINE 5: once-white sketchbook grows darker and darker. Even so, I haven't managed
LINE 6: to completely capture the sights in my memory.
LINE 7: Every morning, I take the train to school during the commuter rush. I sit
LINE 8: through boring classes. I eat lunch with Tsukasa and Takagi. I walk through
LINE 9: town, looking up at the sky. Somewhere along the way, its blue has grown a
LINE 10: little deeper. Bit by bit, the trees lining the streets begin to change color.
LINE 11: In my room at night, I draw. On my desk, there's a stack of mountain
LINE 12: guidebooks I borrowed from the library. I search the ranges of Hida on my
LINE 13: smartphone. I look for ridgelines that match the ones I remember. I keep my
LINE 14: pencil in motion, trying to copy them down onto paper somehow.
LINE 15: Some days, rain falls, smelling like asphalt. Some days shine with
LINE 16: billowing clouds reminiscent of sheep. Some days, strong winds blow,
LINE 17: peppering Tokyo with yellow sand. Every morning, I ride crowded trains to
LINE 18: school. I go to my part-time job. Sometimes, Okudera-senpai and I work the
LINE 19: same shift. I do my best to look her in the eye, to smile properly, to talk
LINE 20: normally. I think, very firmly, that I want to be fair to everyone.
LINE 21: Some nights are still as hot and humid as midsummer, while others are
LINE 22: chilly enough that I wear my track jacket. No matter the temperature, when I'm
LINE 23: drawing, I get so hot it feels like I have a blanket wrapped around my head.
LINE 24: Sweat plops audibly onto my sketchbook. It blurs the lines I've drawn. Even
LINE 25: so, the sights of the town I saw as Mitsuha are taking shape, coming together,
LINE 26: bit by bit.
LINE 27: On the way home from school, on the way home from work, I skip the train
LINE 28: and take long walks. The scenery of Tokyo changes by the day. Before I know
LINE 29: it, there are rows of enormous cranes in Shinjuku and the Outer Garden area
LINE 30: around Meiji Shrine and Yotsuya, at the foot of the Benkei Bridge and partway
LINE 31: up Anchinzaka Hill. Little by little, steel frames and glass stretch up toward the
LINE 32: sky. Beyond them, there's a blank, waning half-moon.
LINE 33: Finally, I finish several drawings of the lake town.
LINE 34: This weekend, I'll head out.
LINE 35: Having made that resolution, I feel the tension drain from my stiff body for
LINE 36: the first time in a long while. Even standing up seems like too much work, so I
LINE 37: slump over my desk.
LINE 38: Just before I fall asleep, I wish hard, the way I always do...
LINE 39: .. .but I still don't wake up as Mitsuha.
LINE 40: + + +
LINE 41: I've packed three days' worth of underwear and my sketchbook in my
LINE 42: backpack. Thinking it might be a little cold there, I put on a thick jacket with a
LINE 43: deep hood. I wind my lucky friendship bracelet around my wrist as usual, then
LINE 44: leave the condo.
LINE 45: It's earlier than I generally leave for school, so the train's empty, although
LINE 46: Tokyo Station is still teeming with people. I line up after some foreigners with
LINE 47: wheeled suitcases, buy a Shinkansen ticket to Nagoya from the automatic ticket
LINE 48: machine, and head for the Tokaido Shinkansen turnstile.
LINE 49: I don't believe my eyes.
LINE 50: "Wha...? Why are you here?!"
LINE 51: Okudera-senpai and Tsukasa are standing together beside a pillar right in
LINE 52: front of me. Okudera-senpai grins.
LINE 53: "Eh-heh-heh. Well, here I am!"
LINE 54: .. .Well, here you are? What are you, the heroine of some cutesy anime?!
LINE 55: I glare at Tsukasa. He looks back at me, his expression bland as if to say, Is
LINE 56: there a problem?
LINE 57: "Tsukasa, you jerk! I asked you to give me an alibi for my dad and to cover
LINE 58: my shift at work, remember?!"
LINE 59: I berate Tsukasa, who's in the seat next to mine, under my breath. Almost
LINE 60: all the unreserved seats on the bullet train are filled with businessmen in suits.
LINE 61: "Takagi's covering for you at work," he says smoothly, displaying his
LINE 62: phone.
LINE 63: "Leave it to me!" Takagi flashes a breezy thumbs-up in the video. "Buy me
LINE 64: a meal, though. "
LINE 65: "Every single friggm' one of you...," I mutter sourly.
LINE 66: Asking Tsukasa was a mistake. I was planning to skip school today and
LINE 67: spend the weekend—Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—in Hida. I went to Tsukasa
LINE 68: yesterday and begged him for help, telling him that something had come up and
LINE 69: I absolutely had to go see a friend, asking him to not ask questions and just let
LINE 70: me use him as an excuse while I was gone.
LINE 71: "I came because I was worried about you," Tsukasa says without a hint of
LINE 72: penitence. "I couldn't just leave you alone, could I? What are you gonna do if it
LINE 73: turns out to be a badger game?"
LINE 74: "A badger what?"
LINE 75: What's he talking about? My eyebrows knit, and Okudera-senpai, who's
LINE 76: sitting on Tsukasa's opposite side, leans in.
LINE 77: "You're going to see a friend you met online, aren't you, Taki?"
LINE 78: "Huh? No, the online thing was just an excuse, and, uh..." Yesterday,
LINE 79: Tsukasa was really persistent about asking who I was visiting, so I vagued
LINE 80: things up and told him it was somebody I'd met on a social networking site.
LINE 81: Tsukasa gravely informs Okudera-senpai, "Frankly, I suspect it's a dating
LINE 82: site."
LINE 83: I nearly do a spit take.
LINE 84: "It is not!"
LINE 85: "You've seemed really off lately, you know." Fooking concerned, Tsukasa
LINE 86: extends a box of Pocky to me. "We'll hang back and watch from a distance."
LINE 87: "What ami, a grade-schooler?!" I demand, lashing out.
LINE 88: Okudera-senpai watches me knowingly. She's absolutely got the wrong
LINE 89: idea about this, too.
LINE 90: This is gonna be one rough trip , I think dismally.
LINE 91: "Approaching Nagoya ," a lazy voice announces over the train's
LINE 92: loudspeaker.
LINE 93: The exchanges with Mitsuha started out of the blue one day and ended just
LINE 94: as suddenly. No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn't figure out why.
LINE 95: After several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have
LINE 96: been a string of extremely vivid dreams.
LINE 97: I've got proof, though. I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on
LINE 98: my phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could
LINE 99: never have happened if I'd been myself. I'm convinced Mitsuha's a real girl.
LINE 100: Her body heat, her pulse, the way she breathes, her voice, the red light
LINE 101: dawning over her closed eyes, the vibrant sounds in her ears—I felt all of that
LINE 102: myself. Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't
LINE 103: alive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.
LINE 104: Because of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.
LINE 105: Something might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.
LINE 106: Maybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I'm overthinking things, at the
LINE 107: very least, she's bound to be worried about the situation, too. That's why I
LINE 108: decided to go see her in person. But...
LINE 109: . .Excuse me? You don't actually know where she is?"
LINE 110: We're in a four-person box seat on the express train Hida. Okudera-senpai
LINE 111: sounds incredulous, stuffing her face with a box lunch she picked up at the
LINE 112: station.
LINE 113: "...Right."
LINE 114: "Your only clue is what the town looks like? You can't even contact this
LINE 115: girl? Are you kidding me?!"
LINE 116: I didn't ask her to come with me. How come I'm getting blamed? I look at
LINE 117: Tsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso
LINE 118: cutlet.
LINE 119: "You are an abysmal tour planner."
LINE 120: "This isn't a tour!"
LINE 121: I lose it for a second. These two think they're on some kind of field trip. I
LINE 122: can read their expressions clearly. There's just no help for this child. Why are
LINE 123: they acting all superior, anyway?
LINE 124: "Well, never mind," Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,
LINE 125: throwing out her chest. "Don't you worry, Taki. We'll help you look."
LINE 126: "Eeeee, it's so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!"
LINE 127: At the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes
LINE 128: over the area's laid-back mascot. It's a full-body plush cow costume wearing a
LINE 129: station employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click
LINE 130: in the little terminal.
LINE 131: "You guys are in the way."
LINE 132: As I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced
LINE 133: that these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her
LINE 134: myself.
LINE 135: The plan goes like this:
LINE 136: Since I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to
LINE 137: a spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll
LINE 138: have to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing
LINE 139: the drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working
LINE 140: our way north along the local line. There's a railroad crossing in one of the
LINE 141: scenes I remember, so following the tracks should work.
LINE 142: It's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a
LINE 143: "plan" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that
LINE 144: many towns built around lakes. I'm convinced I'll probably find some kind of
LINE 145: hint by tonight, though I've got no grounds for thinking that.
LINE 146: Psyching myself up, I take a confident first step, heading out to talk to the
LINE 147: driver of the lone taxi parked outside the station.
LINE 148: ".. .This isn't gonna work..."
LINE 149: I'm slumped at a bus stop, my head drooping.
LINE 150: All the confidence I had when we started asking around has completely
LINE 151: caved.
LINE 152: After that first taxi driver gave me a blunt "N-nope, dunno," we tried police
LINE 153: boxes, convenience stores, souvenir shops, guest houses, diners, and everyone
LINE 154: from farmers to grade-school kids, oblivious to how we probably looked, but
LINE 155: our results were solidly negative. The fact that there was only one local train
LINE 156: every two hours made it hard for us to get around, so we thought we'd try
LINE 157: asking people on the bus. We boarded in high spirits but were the only
LINE 158: passengers. I didn't even feel like asking the driver at that point, and the last
LINE 159: stop was way out in the middle of nowhere, with no houses anywhere in sight.
LINE 160: The whole time, Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai cheerfully made the most of their
LINE 161: day trip, playing word games, cards, phone games, variations on rock-paper-
LINE 162: scissors, and eating snacks. Eventually, they ended up on either side of me on
LINE 163: the bus, leaning against my shoulders and dozing peacefully.
LINE 164: Now, as the two of them guzzle cola in front of the bus stop, I sigh. They
LINE 165: hear it and react together.
LINE 166: "Oh, come on, Taki! You're giving up already?!"
LINE 167: "What about all our hard work?!"
LINE 168: I heave another sigh, so deep it almost brings my lungs up with it. Okudera-
LINE 169: senpai's wearing oddly gung-ho clothes meant for serious hiking. In contrast,
LINE 170: Tsukasa's in chinos like he's just strolling around the neighborhood. At this
LINE 171: point, both outfits really irritate me.
LINE 172: "You guys have been zero help.
LINE 173: They both look innocent, as if to say, Oh, really?
LINE 174: "I'll have a Takayama ramen."
LINE 175: "One Takayama ramen here."
LINE 176: "Uh, okay, then I'll have the same, too."
LINE 177: "You betcha. Three ramen!" says the middle-aged lady cheerily.
LINE 178: On our fruitless way to the next (abnormally distant) station, we found a
LINE 179: ramen shop that was miraculously open and made a beeline inside. When the
LINE 180: lady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, "C'mon in," her smile seemed a
LINE 181: beacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're
LINE 182: lost.
LINE 183: The ramen's good, too. Contrary to its name, it's perfectly ordinary ramen
LINE 184: (I thought it might have Hi da beef on top, but it was regular braised pork), but
LINE 185: as soon as I eat the noodles and veggies, I can feel my body recharging. After
LINE 186: draining the soup bowl dry and drinking two cups of water, I finally take a
LINE 187: breather.
LINE 188: "Do you think we'll be able to get back to Tokyo today?" I ask Tsukasa.
LINE 189: "Hmm... I don't know. We may be cutting it close. Want me to check?"
LINE 190: Tsukasa apparently didn't expect this but nevertheless pulls out his phone
LINE 191: and starts looking up how to get home.
LINE 192: "Thanks," I tell him.
LINE 193: "Taki, you're sure that's all right?" Okudera-senpai asks.
LINE 194: She's across the table from me and hasn't finished eating yet. I'm not
LINE 195: immediately sure how to answer, so I look out the window. The sun's just
LINE 196: barely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields
LINE 197: along the prefectural highway.
LINE 198: "I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track," I
LINE 199: mutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my
LINE 200: strategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town
LINE 201: with sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how
LINE 202: it starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely
LINE 203: ordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered
LINE 204: around a round lake. Even though it felt so solid to me when I finished drawing
LINE 205: it, it looks like an anonymous, mediocre landscape now.
LINE 206: "That's old Itomori, ain't it?"
LINE 207: "Huh?" I turn around and see the lady's apron. She's pouring water into my
LINE 208: empty cup.
LINE 209: "Did you draw that, son? Say, can I have a look?" She takes the sketchbook
LINE 210: from me. "This is a real good picture. Hon, c'mere a sec!"
LINE 211: The woman shouts back toward the kitchen. The three of us watch her,
LINE 212: mouths agape.
LINE 213: The ramen shop owner comes out of the kitchen and considers the sketch,
LINE 214: smiling a little. "Oh, yeah. That was Itomori, for sure. Takes me back..."
LINE 215: "My man's from Itomori, you see."
LINE 216: Itomori?
LINE 217: Suddenly, I remember. I start up out of my chair.
LINE 218: "Itomori... Yeah, Itomori! Of course, why couldn't I remember that? It's
LINE 219: Itomori! It's near here, isn't it?!"
LINE 220: The couple looks mystified, exchanging perplexed glances. The man opens
LINE 221: his mouth.
LINE 222: "Kid... You know about Itomori, don't you? That's where—"
LINE 223: Tsukasa interrupts loudly. "Itomori?! Taki, don't tell me—"
LINE 224: "What, wait—? You mean, the one where the comet...?!"
LINE 225: Even Okudera-senpai speaks up, eyes wide.
LINE 226: "Huh.?"
LINE 227: I don't understand what's going on and look around at the others. They're
LINE 228: all watching me dubiously. The shadow of something that's been trying to
LINE 229: surface in my mind this whole time rustles stealthily, growing more and more
LINE 230: ominous.
LINE 231: The cry of a kite trails through the atmosphere, lonely enough to freeze the
LINE 232: blood.
LINE 233: A row of Do Not Enter barricades extends as far as the eye can see,
LINE 234: throwing long shadows over the cracked asphalt.
LINE 235: A sign with vines tangled around it reads, In accordance with the
LINE 236: Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act, this area is off-limits. KEEP OUT.
LINE 237: —Reconstruction Agency.
LINE 238: And below me lies Itomori, devastated by some unimaginable force and
LINE 239: mostly swallowed up by the lake.
LINE 240: ".. .Is this really the place?"
LINE 241: Okudera-senpai walks up behind me, her voice trembling. Without waiting
LINE 242: for me to respond, Tsukasa answers, sounding desperately cheerful.
LINE 243: "It can't be! Like I've been saying, Taki's confused."
LINE 244: "...This is it."
LINE 245: I tear my eyes away from the ruins below me, scanning my surroundings.
LINE 246: "It isn't just the town. I remember this schoolyard, the mountains around us,
LINE 247: the high school... I remember all of it perfectly!"
LINE 248: I have to shout the words to convince myself. Behind us is the school
LINE 249: building, black and sooty, with some of its windows broken. We're standing on
LINE 250: the grounds of Itomori High School, looking out across the lake.
LINE 251: "So you're saying this is the town you were looking for? The one where
LINE 252: your friend online lives?" Tsukasa shouts, that parched smile still clinging to
LINE 253: his voice.
LINE 254: "That's not even possible! That disaster was three years ago. Hundreds of
LINE 255: people died! You remember it, right, Taki?!"
LINE 256: At that, I finally turn toward Tsukasa.
LINE 257: "...Died?"
LINE 258: I meant to look at his face, but my gaze goes right through him, then through
LINE 259: the high school behind him, only to dissipate into the distance. I know I must be
LINE 260: looking at something, but there's nothing there.
LINE 261: "Three years ago...she died?"
LINE 262: Abruptly, I remember.
LINE 263: The comet I saw over Tokyo three years earlier. Countless shooting stars
LINE 264: falling through the western sky. I thought it was beautiful, like something out of
LINE 265: a dream. I got all excited about it.
LINE 266: That's when she died?
LINE 267: Don't.
LINE 268: I can't acknowledge that.
LINE 269: I search for words. For proof.
LINE 270: "That can't be true... I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote."
LINE 271: I retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the
LINE 272: battery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up
LINE 273: Mitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.
LINE 274: I rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.
LINE 275: "Wha...?"
LINE 276: First one letter, then another.
LINE 277: The words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.
LINE 278: Before long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by
LINE 279: one, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding
LINE 280: down delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.
LINE 281: "Why...?" I ask very quietly.
LINE 282: The kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.
LINE 283: Three years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet
LINE 284: with a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach
LINE 285: to Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put
LINE 286: Halley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4
LINE 287: billion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly
LINE 288: seventy-five thousand miles of Earth—closer than the moon. The tail of this
LINE 289: shining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first
LINE 290: time in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it
LINE 291: welcomed Comet Tiamat.
LINE 292: Until the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's
LINE 293: nucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in
LINE 294: diameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,
LINE 295: plummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per
LINE 296: second. Tragically, it struck Japan—a residential area called Itomori.
LINE 297: The town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision
LINE 298: occurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which
LINE 299: must have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.
LINE 300: The meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The
LINE 301: destruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge
LINE 302: hole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,
LINE 303: magnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds
LINE 304: later, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater
LINE 305: part of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the
LINE 306: town's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in
LINE 307: human history.
LINE 308: Since the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,
LINE 309: ultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.
LINE 310: Damage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the
LINE 311: thousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In
LINE 312: less than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.
LINE 313: Fourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori
LINE 314: was gone.
LINE 315: —These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.
LINE 316: Three years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet
LINE 317: Tiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.
LINE 318: .. .But that's weird.
LINE 319: It doesn't make sense.
LINE 320: I lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.
LINE 321: That means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.
LINE 322: The comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each
LINE 323: other.
LINE 324: It'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.
LINE 325: However, paging through books in this city library near Itomori, I'm
LINE 326: hopelessly confused. For a while now, in the deepest corner of my mind,
LINE 327: someone's been whispering, This is where you were.
LINE 328: Vanished Itomori—Complete Records
LINE 329: Itomori—The Village That Sank in a Night
LINE 330: The Tragedy of Comet Tiamat
LINE 331: I flip through tome after tome with titles like these. The photos of bygone
LINE 332: days in Itomori unmistakably show places I've been. This is the grade school
LINE 333: Yotsuha goes to. Miyamizu Shrine is where their grandma is the chief priestess.
LINE 334: This pointlessly big parking lot, the two snack bars right next to each other, the
LINE 335: convenience store that looks like a barn, the little railroad crossing on the
LINE 336: mountain road, and of course Itomori High School... At this point, I recognize
LINE 337: all of them clearly. Seeing those ruined streets with my own eyes has
LINE 338: sharpened my memories.
LINE 339: It's hard to breathe. My heart is struggling, beating irregularly, and refuses
LINE 340: to calm down.
LINE 341: It feels as though the vivid photos are silently absorbing the air and any
LINE 342: sense of reality.
LINE 343: Itomori High—Final Sports Festival
LINE 344: The photo above the caption shows high schoolers in the middle of a three-
LINE 345: legged race. The pair on the end seems familiar. One has straight-cut bangs and
LINE 346: braids. The other girl's hair is bound up with an orange cord.
LINE 347: The air gets even thinner.
LINE 348: I feel as though hot blood is oozing down the back of my neck, but when I
LINE 349: wipe it away with my hand, it's transparent sweat.
LINE 350: Taki."
LINE 351: I look up. Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai are standing there. They hand me a
LINE 352: single book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:
LINE 353: Itomori Comet Disaster List and Catalog of Victims
LINE 354: I turn the pages. The victims' names and addresses are given by district. I
LINE 355: run my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on
LINE 356: names I recognize.
LINE 357: Teshigawara, Katsuhiko (17)
LINE 358: Natori, Sayaka (17)
LINE 359: "Teshigawara and Saya..."
LINE 360: As I murmur, I hear Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai suck in their breath.
LINE 361: Then I find the names that prove it all.
LINE 362: Miyamizu, Hitoha (82)
LINE 363: Miyamizu, Mitsuha (17)
LINE 364: Miyamizu, \btsuha (9)
LINE 365: The other two peer over my shoulder at the list.
LINE 366: "That's her.? It has to be some kind of mistake! I mean, she's—"
LINE 367: Okudera-senpai sounds as if she might burst into tears. "She's been dead for
LINE 368: three years."
LINE 369: Trying to deny her words, I shout, "Just two or three weeks ago, she—!"
LINE 370: It's hard to breathe. I inhale desperately and continue. This time, it comes out
LINE 371: as a whisper. "She told me we'd be able to see the comet."
LINE 372: I somehow manage to tear my eyes away from the letters that spell out
LINE 373: Mitsuha.
LINE 374: "So...!"
LINE 375: When I raise my head, my face is reflected in the dark window in front of
LINE 376: me. Who are you? I think, out of nowhere.
LINE 377: From deep in my mind, very far away, I hear a hoarse voice. "...My, my.
LINE 378: You 're — "
LINE 379: "\fou're dreamin', aren't you?"
LINE 380: A dream? I'm drowning in a wave of confusion.
LINE 381: What...
LINE 382: ...inthe world...
LINE 383: ...ami doing?
LINE 384: + + +
LINE 385: In the next room, I can hear the sounds of a dinner party.
LINE 386: Someone says something, there's a burst of laughter, and then applause
LINE 387: echoes like a downpour. It's been happening over and over for a while now. I
LINE 388: strain my ears, wondering what sort of group they are. No matter how hard I
LINE 389: listen, though, I can't make out a single word. All I can tell is that they're
LINE 390: speaking Japanese.
LINE 391: Thunk! There's a loud noise, and the next thing I know, I'm slumped over
LINE 392: with my head on the desk. I must've hit my forehead; a dull pain follows a little
LINE 393: later. I'm dead tired.
LINE 394: No matter how much I read the reduced-size editions of old newspapers
LINE 395: and magazine back issues, I can't seem to get the text into my head anymore.
LINE 396: I've checked my phone several times, but not one of her journal entries is on it.
LINE 397: Every trace is gone.
LINE 398: With my head still down, I open my eyes. Glaring at the desk a fraction of
LINE 399: an inch in front of me, I try putting into words the conclusion I've reached over
LINE 400: the past few hours.
LINE 401: "It was all just a dream, and..."
LINE 402: Do I want to believe that or not?
LINE 403: "The scenery looked familiar because I subconsciously remembered the
LINE 404: news from three years ago. Meaning, she was..."
LINE 405: What was she?
LINE 406: "... A ghost? Or, no... It was all a..."
LINE 407: All...my...
LINE 408: "...Delusion?"
LINE 409: With a start, I raise my head.
LINE 410: Something's disappearing.
LINE 411: Her—
LINE 412: "What was her name...?"
LINE 413: Tap, tap , comes a sudden knock, and the thin wooden door opens.
LINE 414: "Tsukasa says he's going down to take a bath."
LINE 415: Okudera-senpai enters wearing one of the inn's light robes. The atmosphere
LINE 416: in the room, which had seemed cold and isolated, suddenly softens. I feel
LINE 417: terribly relieved.
LINE 418: "Uh, Okudera-senpai?"
LINE 419: I get up from my chair. She's crouched down in front of her backpack.
LINE 420: "I've been saying all sorts of weird stuff... I'm sorry about today."
LINE 421: Zipping her backpack as if carefully sealing something away, Okudera-
LINE 422: senpai stands. Somehow she seems to move in slow motion.
LINE 423: ".. .It's fine," she says, shaking her head with a faint smile.
LINE 424: "I'm sorry we could only get one room."
LINE 425: "Tsukasa said the same thing to me downstairs," Okudera-senpai chuckles.
LINE 426: We're sitting facing each other across the little table by the window.
LINE 427: "I don't mind a bit. They say a group just happened to be staying here
LINE 428: tonight, so they don't have any rooms to spare. The man who runs the inn said
LINE 429: it's a teachers' union social."
LINE 430: Then she laughingly tells me how they treated her to Asian pears in the
LINE 431: lounge after she got out of the bath. She's the sort of person who makes
LINE 432: everyone want to give her something. The scent of the inn's shampoo reaches
LINE 433: me, like a rare perfume from a distant, foreign land.
LINE 434: "Look at that. Itomori used to make braided cords. How pretty," Okudera-
LINE 435: senpai murmurs, flipping through a volume of local Itomori materials. It's one
LINE 436: of the books I borrowed from the library.
LINE 437: "My mother wears kimonos sometimes, so we have several of these at
LINE 438: home. Oh, say..."
LINE 439: Lifting my teacup, my hand pauses. She's examining my right wrist.
LINE 440: "That one on your wrist, Taki. Is that a braided cord?"
LINE 441: "Oh, this is..."
LINE 442: I set the cup down on the table and consider my arm. This is my good-luck
LINE 443: charm: a vivid orange cord, thicker than a thread, wound around my wrist.
LINE 444: ...Huh?
LINE 445: Isn't this—?
LINE 446: "I think somebody gave it to me a long time ago. I wear it sometimes, for
LINE 447: good luck..."
LINE 448: The deepest part of my mind prickles again.
LINE 449: "Who was it?" I murmur.
LINE 450: I can't remember.
LINE 451: Still, if I follow this cord, it feels like I'll find something.
LINE 452: "...You, too, Taki."
LINE 453: The gentle voice makes me raise my head to see concern on Okudera-
LINE 454: senpai's face. "Why don't you go take a bath?"
LINE 455: "Abath... Right..."
LINE 456: But almost immediately my attention returns to the braided cord. I feel as
LINE 457: though I'll lose something forever if I let go here, and I desperately ransack my
LINE 458: memories. The dinner party is over, though I don't know when it ended. The
LINE 459: quiet song of autumn insects fills the room.
LINE 460: "Somebody who made braided cords told me something once."
LINE 461: Whose voice is that? It's kind and hoarse and tranquil. Like something from
LINE 462: a folktale.
LINE 463: "They said that cords are the flow of time itself. They twist and tangle,
LINE 464: come apart and reunite. They said that's time. That's..."
LINE 465: A mountain in autumn. The sound of a brook. The smell of water. The taste
LINE 466: of sweet barley tea.
LINE 467: "That's musubi —"
LINE 468: The scene bursts into my mind.
LINE 469: The body of the god on top of the mountain. The sake we offered to it.
LINE 470: "...That place...!"
LINE 471: I pull a map out from under the pile of books and open it. It's a map of
LINE 472: Itomori from three years ago that I found in a small independent shop, covered
LINE 473: in dust. The topography from back when there was just one lake. The place
LINE 474: where we offered the sake should be far outside the area the meteorite
LINE 475: destroyed.
LINE 476: If I go there... If that sake's there...
LINE 477: I pick up my pencil, searching for a landform that looks likely. It was way
LINE 478: north of the shrine, a place like a caldera. Desperately, I try to find something
LINE 479: along those lines.
LINE 480: I might be hearing Okudera-senpai's voice, distantly, but by now, I can't
LINE 481: tear my eyes off the map.
LINE 482: ...ki... Taki.
LINE 483: Somebody's calling my name. It's a girl's voice.
LINE 484: "Taki, Taki."
LINE 485: Her voice is earnest, pleading, as if she's about to cry. A voice trembling
LINE 486: with loneliness, like the glimmer of distant stars.
LINE 487: "Don't you remember me?"
LINE 488: I wake up.
LINE 489: ...That's right. I'm at an inn. I've been sleeping slumped over the table by
LINE 490: the window. I can sense Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai beyond the sliding door,
LINE 491: asleep on their futons. The room is strangely quiet. I can't hear any insects or
LINE 492: cars. The wind isn't blowing, either.
LINE 493: I sit up. The rustle of my clothes is loud enough to startle me. Outside the
LINE 494: window, the world is just beginning to shake off the darkness.
LINE 495: I look at the cord on my wrist. The faint echoes of the girl's voice linger in
LINE 496: my ears.
LINE 497: —Who are you? I ask. I don't even know her name.
LINE 498: Naturally, there's no answer.
LINE 499: But, well, that's all right.
LINE 500: Okudera-senpai and Tsukasa—
LINE 501: There's a place I need to check, no matter what. Please
LINE 502: go back to Tokyo ahead of me. I'm sorry for being
LINE 503: selfish. I swear I'll come back later. Thanks.
LINE 504: —Taki
LINE 505: I write a note. As an afterthought, I take a five-thousand-yen bill out of my
LINE 506: wallet and put it under a teacup along with the memo.
LINE 507: We've never met, but I'm about to come looking for you.
LINE 508: + + +
LINE 509: He's gruff and doesn't say much, but he's a really nice guy , I think, studying
LINE 510: the sinewy hands on the steering wheel beside me.
LINE 511: It's the man from the ramen shop. He's the one who took us to Itomori High
LINE 512: School yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,
LINE 513: and he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn't worked, I
LINE 514: was planning to hitchhike, but I can't imagine any cars would've given me a
LINE 515: ride to a ruined, abandoned town. I'm seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.
LINE 516: From the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New
LINE 517: Itomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the
LINE 518: water. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams
LINE 519: jutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have
LINE 520: gotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the
LINE 521: place has always been like this. For that reason, I don't really know how to
LINE 522: process what I'm seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my
LINE 523: own helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much
LINE 524: for ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning
LINE 525: in the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if
LINE 526: the gods have set an enormous lid there.
LINE 527: We travel north along the lake, and when the car can't go any higher, the
LINE 528: man sets the parking brake.
LINE 529: "Looks like rain," he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. "This
LINE 530: mountain ain't real steep, but don't push your luck. If anythin' happens, you call
LINE 531: us."
LINE 532: "Yessir."
LINE 533: "Also, here—" He holds out a big lunch box to me. "Eat this up top."
LINE 534: Automatically, I accept it with both hands. It's heavy.
LINE 535: "Th-thank you very much..."
LINE 536: .. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,
LINE 537: and the ramen was super good. I can't make any of the words come out the way
LINE 538: I want them to—all I manage is a tiny "Thanks. Really." The guy smiles
LINE 539: slightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.
LINE 540: "I dunno what's goin' on with you," he says, exhaling smoke. "But that
LINE 541: picture ofltomori you made. That was good."
LINE 542: There's a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.
LINE 543: I'm walking up a path to the shrine that's as vague as a deer track.
LINE 544: Sometimes I stop to check the destination I've marked on the map against
LINE 545: the GPS on my phone. It's all right—I'm getting closer. The surrounding
LINE 546: scenery looks sort of familiar, but I've climbed this mountain only once, in a
LINE 547: dream. I'm not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow
LINE 548: the map.
LINE 549: After I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride
LINE 550: was completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-
LINE 551: senpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here
LINE 552: because they were worried about me. I must've looked really pathetic. I bet
LINE 553: they thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively
LINE 554: distracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn't.
LINE 555: I can't keep acting like that forever. I can't keep taking advantage of the
LINE 556: help people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the
LINE 557: gaps in the trees.
LINE 558: Suddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle
LINE 559: and shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.
LINE 560: The rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt
LINE 561: away.
LINE 562: The temperature's falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my
LINE 563: skin.
LINE 564: I eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There
LINE 565: are three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-
LINE 566: sliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like
LINE 567: such a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it's funny. My body shakes with
LINE 568: cold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and
LINE 569: swallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.
LINE 570: This is musubi, I think.
LINE 571: "Putting anything in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
LINE 572: called musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. "
LINE 573: That day, I decided I'd remember those words even after I woke up. I say it
LINE 574: aloud:
LINE 575: "...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That's
LINE 576: musubi. That's time."
LINE 577: I look at the cord on my wrist.
LINE 578: It hasn't worn through yet. The connection is still there.
LINE 579: Before I know it, the trees have vanished, and I'm in a mossy, rocky area.
LINE 580: Below me, I can see fragments of the gourd-shaped lake through gaps in the
LINE 581: thick clouds. I've finally reached the peak.
LINE 582: "...It's there!"
LINE 583: Sure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant
LINE 584: sacred tree.
LINE 585: "It's really there! It wasn't a dream!"
LINE 586: The rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I
LINE 587: scrub roughly at my face with my sleeve, then start down the slope into the
LINE 588: caldera.
LINE 589: In front of me, what was a little stream in my memories is now a decent-
LINE 590: size pond. Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that
LINE 591: dream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several
LINE 592: dozen yards away on the other side.
LINE 593: This is the edge of the next world.
LINE 594: I remember somebody saying that to me once.
LINE 595: Does that make this the Sanzu River?
LINE 596: I step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot
LINE 597: into a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The
LINE 598: heavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing
LINE 599: sound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with
LINE 600: muddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm
LINE 601: not welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,
LINE 602: into the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get
LINE 603: across somehow.
LINE 604: The massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.
LINE 605: I don't know whether the "body of the god" is the tree, the rock, or whether
LINE 606: the shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's
LINE 607: a little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go
LINE 608: down it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.
LINE 609: The silence here is even deeper than it was outside.
LINE 610: I unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to
LINE 611: make sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single
LINE 612: movement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems
LINE 613: completely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.
LINE 614: This place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.
LINE 615: The tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,
LINE 616: two four-inch urns sit side by side.
LINE 617: "It's the sake we carried up here."
LINE 618: Gently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold
LINE 619: anymore.
LINE 620: "This is her little sister's..."
LINE 621: My hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick
LINE 622: it up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put
LINE 623: down roots.
LINE 624: "And this is the one I brought."
LINE 625: I sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on
LINE 626: it. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It
LINE 627: must have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this
LINE 628: time into words.
LINE 629: . .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?"
LINE 630: I untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.
LINE 631: "Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died
LINE 632: three years ago when the meteorite fell?"
LINE 633: I pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the
LINE 634: lid.
LINE 635: "Half of her..."
LINE 636: I bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles
LINE 637: floating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.
LINE 638: " Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then
LINE 639: reuniting..."
LINE 640: I raise the lidful of sake to my lips.
LINE 641: "If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time..."
LINE 642: Take me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound
LINE 643: is so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it
LINE 644: hits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.
LINE 645: But nothing happens.
LINE 646: For a little while, I sit very still.
LINE 647: I'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly
LINE 648: vague and dizzy... But that's all.
LINE 649: It's no good. It didn't work.
LINE 650: I put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm
LINE 651: falling , I think.
LINE 652: ...That's weird.
LINE 653: I've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back
LINE 654: doesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the
LINE 655: cave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.
LINE 656: "The comet...!"
LINE 657: Involuntarily, I say it out loud.
LINE 658: There's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.
LINE 659: It's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing
LINE 660: its long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and
LINE 661: shimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the
LINE 662: cave.
LINE 663: I stare.
LINE 664: The image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.
LINE 665: Slowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat
LINE 666: of its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,
LINE 667: shining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.
LINE 668: I fall back, and my head hits the rock at the exact moment the comet strikes
LINE 669: my body.
