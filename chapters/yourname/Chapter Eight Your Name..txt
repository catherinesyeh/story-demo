LINE 1: Chapter Eight
LINE 2: Your Name.
LINE 3: I have a few habits I've unconsciously picked up.
LINE 4: For example, when I'm feeling rushed and flustered, I touch the back of my
LINE 5: neck. When I wash my face, I look into my eyes, reflected in the mirror. Even
LINE 6: on mornings when I'm in a hurry, when I step out the front door, I pause and
LINE 7: take a long look at the scenery.
LINE 8: I also gaze at my palm for no reason.
LINE 9: "The next station is... Yoyogi... Yoyogi. "
LINE 10: As the synthetic audio announces the station, I realize I'm doing it again. I
LINE 11: look away from my right hand, gazing absently out the window instead. We're
LINE 12: slowing down, and beyond the glass, the crowd of people standing on the
LINE 13: platform flows by.
LINE 14: Abruptly, my whole body breaks out in goose bumps.
LINE 15: A beat later, I think, It s her.
LINE 16: She was standing on the platform.
LINE 17: The train stops. Even waiting for the doors to open seems to take too long,
LINE 18: and I leave the train at a sprint. I turn in a circle, scanning the platform. Several
LINE 19: passengers dart suspicious glances at me as they pass, and my head finally
LINE 20: cools down.
LINE 21: I'm not looking for anyone in particular. "She" isn't anybody.
LINE 22: This is yet another habit I've picked up unawares, and it's probably a
LINE 23: weird one.
LINE 24: The next thing I know, still standing on the platform, I'm gazing at my palm
LINE 25: again. Just a little more, I think.
LINE 26: Just a little longer. Just a little more.
LINE 27: I don't know what wish accompanies those words, but somewhere along
LINE 28: the way, I've started longing for it.
LINE 29: "I applied to your company because I like buildings— Or, no...I mean
LINE 30: cityscapes. The landscape of people living their lives in general."
LINE 31: The faces of the four interviewers in front of me cloud slightly. No, no,
LINE 32: that's just my imagination , I think. This is the first time I've managed to make
LINE 33: it to the second round of interviews at a company. I can't blow this chance , I
LINE 34: think, psyching myself up again.
LINE 35: "I always have. Even I don't really understand why, but, um... Anyway, I
LINE 36: like them. What I mean is, I like watching buildings and the people who live
LINE 37: and work there. That's why I often go to cafes and restaurants. I even worked
LINE 38: at a few part-time—"
LINE 39: "I see." One of the interviewers cuts me off gently. "Then could you tell us
LINE 40: why you chose to enter the construction field, rather than the restaurant
LINE 41: industry?"
LINE 42: She's a middle-aged woman, the only one of the four who looked kind, and
LINE 43: I finally realize I've been blabbing about an irrelevant reason for applying. I
LINE 44: break out in a sweat in a suit I'm not yet used to wearing.
LINE 45: "Well, I... Serving customers at my part-time job was fun, but I guess you
LINE 46: could say I wanted to be involved in something bigger..."
LINE 47: Something bigger? That's a middle school answer. Even I can tell my face
LINE 48: is flushing red.
LINE 49: "I mean... The way I see it, there's no telling when even Tokyo could
LINE 50: disappear."
LINE 51: This time, the interviewers' faces really do cloud over. Realizing I've been
LINE 52: touching the back of my neck, I hastily put hands on my knees again.
LINE 53: "So if it does— No, precisely because it will someday, I want to create the
LINE 54: sort of town that warms people, even if it's only a memory—"
LINE 55: Agh, it's no good. Even I can't follow what I'm saying. I've failed this one,
LINE 56: too. Thinking this, I glance at the gray skyscrapers that tower behind the
LINE 57: interviewers, and I feel like crying.
LINE 58: "So? How many companies have you interviewed at, including today?"
LINE 59: Takagi asks me.
LINE 60: "I'm not keeping track," I tell him glumly.
LINE 61: Looking awfully entertained, Tsukasa says, "I don't think you're going to
LINE 62: make it."
LINE 63: "I don't want to hear that from you," I cut back crossly
LINE 64: "Sure it's not because you just don't look good in a suit?" Takagi grins.
LINE 65: "You guys aren't much different!" I bristle angrily.
LINE 66: "I've got unofficial offers from two companies," he counters cheerfully.
LINE 67: "I have eight," Tsukasa condescends.
LINE 68: "Rrgh...!"
LINE 69: I have no comeback. My coffee cup rattles in my fingers as they tremble
LINE 70: with humiliation.
LINE 71: Tweedle.
LINE 72: My phone chirps from the table. I check the message, drain what's left of
LINE 73: my coffee in one gulp, and stand.
LINE 74: Come to think of it, the three of us came to this cafe a lot when we were in
LINE 75: high school. The memory strikes me after I've waved good-bye to Tsukasa and
LINE 76: Takagi and started jogging toward the station. Life was so carefree back then. I
LINE 77: didn't have to think about the future or finding a job, and somehow, every day
LINE 78: was ludicrously fun. Especially that one summer—I think it was during my
LINE 79: second year of high school. It seems like that summer was especially thrilling.
LINE 80: What happened that year? I think back and conclude there wasn't anything in
LINE 81: particular. I guess I must've just been at an age when absolutely anything was
LINE 82: enough to trigger a giggling fit.
LINE 83: ...Wait, no, that's something they say about girls... Absentmindedly, I hop
LINE 84: down the stairs to the subway.
LINE 85: "Ooh. Job hunting, hmm?"
LINE 86: Okudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.
LINE 87: It's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly
LINE 88: languid hum of people released from their days at work or school.
LINE 89: "Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great."
LINE 90: "Hmm..." Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She
LINE 91: inspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, "You don't
LINE 92: think it's because suits don't look good on you?"
LINE 93: "I-is it really that bad?!" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.
LINE 94: "Oh, come on, I'mjoking!"
LINE 95: Okudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.
LINE 96: "Let's walk a little," Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,
LINE 97: going against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut
LINE 98: across Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that
LINE 99: the trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass
LINE 100: have on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,
LINE 101: too.
LINE 102: "What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue."
LINE 103: Feeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to
LINE 104: Okudera-senpai beside me.
LINE 105: "What?" Her glossy lips pout. "I can't get in touch with you without a
LINE 106: reason?"
LINE 107: "No, no, no!" I wave my hands hastily.
LINE 108: "You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time."
LINE 109: "Y-yes. I am."
LINE 110: She smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. "I was in the area
LINE 111: for work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki." She was hired by a major
LINE 112: clothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. "Life in the suburbs
LINE 113: is fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind," she tells me, gazing at
LINE 114: her surroundings like she's a little awestruck. "Look," she says suddenly, and I
LINE 115: raise my head.
LINE 116: We're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant
LINE 117: outdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage
LINE 118: of gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster—Eight
LINE 119: Years Later in big letters.
LINE 120: "We went to Itomori once, didn't we?" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,
LINE 121: as though she's searching distant memories. "You were still in high school,
LINE 122: Taki, so it must've been..."
LINE 123: "Five years ago, maybe?" I finish the sentence for her.
LINE 124: "That long..." She exhales a little, as if surprised. "I'm forgetting all sorts
LINE 125: of things."
LINE 126: She's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk
LINE 127: up Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I
LINE 128: try remembering that day.
LINE 129: It was the summer of my second year in high school— No, it was just about
LINE 130: this time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short
LINE 131: trip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way
LINE 132: to Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.
LINE 133: Right, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the
LINE 134: side of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur
LINE 135: and grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a
LINE 136: vague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed
LINE 137: a mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to
LINE 138: Tokyo by myself the next day.
LINE 139: That's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that
LINE 140: comet.
LINE 141: In the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human
LINE 142: history, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,
LINE 143: almost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the
LINE 144: comet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and
LINE 145: most of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.
LINE 146: It was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all
LINE 147: sorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical
LINE 148: phenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the
LINE 149: media's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around
LINE 150: wildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit
LINE 151: with Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or
LINE 152: questioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an
LINE 153: evacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been
LINE 154: foretold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so
LINE 155: isolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the
LINE 156: power across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite
LINE 157: strike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the
LINE 158: programs to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as
LINE 159: with most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of
LINE 160: Itomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.
LINE 161: Still... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of
LINE 162: Itomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had
LINE 163: materialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had
LINE 164: visited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.
LINE 165: What in the world had it been?
LINE 166: Well, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink
LINE 167: into the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I
LINE 168: write the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job
LINE 169: next year, not ancient history I don't really remember.
LINE 170: "The wind's come up," Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair
LINE 171: rises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,
LINE 172: reaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a
LINE 173: melancholy inside me.
LINE 174: "Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough," Okudera-senpai
LINE 175: says when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.
LINE 176: We ate dinner at the Italian restaurant where we'd worked part-time as
LINE 177: students. Thanks to a promise I totally don't remember making—"Come to
LINE 178: think of it, Taki, didn't you say you'd treat me after you graduated from high
LINE 179: school?"—I ended up paying for Okudera-senpai. Even so, I felt a little bit
LINE 180: proud picking up the check.
LINE 181: "You know, I had no idea the place we used to work had such good food."
LINE 182: "Yeah, all the meals they gave us during our shifts were like school
LINE 183: lunches."
LINE 184: "We went for years without catching on."
LINE 185: We laugh. Okudera-senpai draws a deep, contented breath, then says, "All
LINE 186: right. I'll see you later." She waves at me, and there's a band like a thin drop
LINE 187: of water shining on her ring finger.
LINE 188: "You'll find happiness someday, too," she'd assured me earlier over an
LINE 189: espresso, after informing me she was getting married. I couldn't manage a good
LINE 190: response—I just mumbled something congratulatory.
LINE 191: I'm not particularly unhappy , I think, watching Okudera-senpai's
LINE 192: silhouette descend the pedestrian-bridge stairs. That said, I don't really
LINE 193: understand what happiness is yet, either.
LINE 194: I abruptly inspect my palm. All that's there is an absence.
LINE 195: Just a little longer..., I think one more time.
LINE 196: Before I know it, the season's changed again.
LINE 197: An unusually typhoon-filled autumn passed, moving straight into a winter of
LINE 198: nothing but cold rain. Tonight, too, the rain is whispering down unabated, like
LINE 199: the memory of a pleasant chat on some bygone day Christmas lights twinkle
LINE 200: beyond windows beaded thickly with water droplets.
LINE 201: I take a sip from my paper cup of coffee, as if swallowing my scattered
LINE 202: thoughts, then look down at my notebook again. Even now, in December, it's
LINE 203: packed with job-hunting appointments.
LINE 204: Visits with former upperclassmen to discuss their work, information
LINE 205: sessions, entry deadlines, paper schedules, interview dates. The range is
LINE 206: chaotic, covering everything from major general contractors to design offices
LINE 207: to old-town factories, and as I check the notebook against the schedule on my
LINE 208: phone, even I'm a bit disgusted by it. I start organizing the main points from
LINE 209: tomorrow onward, writing them into my notebook.
LINE 210: "Y'know, I'd like to go to at least one more bridal fair."
LINE 211: Mixed with the sound of the rain, the conversations of strangers sound a bit
LINE 212: like secrets. The couple behind me has been discussing their wedding for a
LINE 213: while now, and it makes me think of Okudera-senpai. Their voices and bearing
LINE 214: are completely different, though. There's a bit of an easygoing regional accent
LINE 215: to their speech, and their conversation seems completely relaxed, as if they're
LINE 216: childhood friends. I'm not really listening, but my ears pick up what they're
LINE 217: saying.
LINE 218: "Again?" The guy sounds annoyed, but even then, there's no mistaking the
LINE 219: affection in his tone. "We've been to a ton of fairs already. They were all
LINE 220: pretty much the same stuff."
LINE 221: "Well, I was thinkin' a Shinto ceremony might be nice, too."
LINE 222: "You said your dream was to have it in a chapel."
LINE 223: "This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I can't make up my mind that easily."
LINE 224: "But you said you did make up your mind," the guy quietly complains, and I
LINE 225: chuckle.
LINE 226: The girl ignores him. "Hmm.she murmurs, thinking. "Never mind that.
LINE 227: Tesshi, you gotta shave off those whiskers before the ceremony."
LINE 228: I was about to drink my coffee, but my hand stops dead.
LINE 229: My pulse is speeding up, though I don't understand why.
LINE 230: "I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?"
LINE 231: "But you're eatin' cake!"
LINE 232: "I'll start for real tomorrow!"
LINE 233: Slowly, I look behind me.
LINE 234: The two of them have already gotten up from their chairs and are pulling on
LINE 235: their coats. The tall, skinny guy is wearing a stocking cap over his buzzed
LINE 236: head. I just catch a glimpse of his profile. The girl is petite, and her bobbed
LINE 237: hair makes her seem young, almost like a student. The pair turns away and
LINE 238: leaves the cafe. For some reason, I can't take my eyes off their backs.
LINE 239: "Thank you for your visit." The cafe employee's voice reaches my ears
LINE 240: indistinctly, mingled with the rain.
LINE 241: By the time I leave the cafe, the rain has turned to snow.
LINE 242: Maybe it's because of all the moisture up in the atmosphere, but the town is
LINE 243: oddly warm in the falling snow. I feel strangely uneasy, as if I've wandered
LINE 244: into the wrong season. It seems to me as if each and every person I pass is
LINE 245: hiding some important secret, and in spite of myself, I keep turning back to
LINE 246: look at them.
LINE 247: I go straight to the ward library, which is almost ready to close for the
LINE 248: evening. The sparseness of the handful of readers in the vast, vaulted space
LINE 249: makes the air inside feel even chillier than outside. I take a seat and open the
LINE 250: book I've retrieved from the stacks. The title is Vanished Itomori—Complete
LINE 251: Records. It's a collection of photographs.
LINE 252: As if removing an ancient seal, I slowly page through the book.
LINE 253: Gingko trees and an elementary school. The shrine's steep stairs, with their
LINE 254: view over the lake. A shrine gate with peeling paint. A tiny railroad crossing,
LINE 255: like toy building blocks abruptly set down in the fields. A pointlessly
LINE 256: expansive parking lot, two snack bars right next to each other, a drab concrete
LINE 257: high school. A prefectural road with old, cracked asphalt. A guardrail that
LINE 258: traces a winding hill road. Vinyl greenhouses, reflecting the sky.
LINE 259: They're the sort of ordinary sights you see all over Japan, so I recognize all
LINE 260: of them. I can visualize the temperature of the stone walls and the chill of the
LINE 261: wind, just as if I'd lived there.
LINE 262: Why is this so... ? I wonder as I turn the pages.
LINE 263: Why do the unremarkable sights of a town that no longer exists make my
LINE 264: heart hurt this much?
LINE 265: + + +
LINE 266: Once, fueled by intense emotions, I made some sort of resolution.
LINE 267: I remember this out of nowhere when I look up at the light in somebody's
LINE 268: window on my way home, or when I reach for a box lunch in the convenience
LINE 269: store, or when I retie my loose shoelaces.
LINE 270: I decided something once. I took an oath because I met somebody—no, so
LINE 271: that I would meet somebody.
LINE 272: Washing my face and staring into the mirror, tossing a plastic bag in the
LINE 273: trash, squinting at the morning sun between the buildings, I think this and smile
LINE 274: wryly.
LINE 275: "Somebody," "something." In the end, I don't know a thing.
LINE 276: Still, I think as I close the door at an interview.
LINE 277: Still, even now, I'm fighting my way through. Perhaps it's a bit dramatic to
LINE 278: say, but I'm struggling against life. Wasn't that what I decided once? To
LINE 279: struggle. To live. To breathe and walk. To run. To eat. To bind, musubi. To live
LINE 280: an ordinary life so I shed tears over the sights of a perfectly ordinary town.
LINE 281: Just a little longer , I think.
LINE 282: Just a little is fine. Just a little more.
LINE 283: I don't know what it is I want, but I keep on wishing for something.
LINE 284: Just a little longer. Just a little more.
LINE 285: The cherry blossoms bloom and scatter, long rains wash the streets, white
LINE 286: clouds billow high, the leaves change color, freezing winds blow. Then the
LINE 287: cherry trees bloom again.
LINE 288: The days are accelerating.
LINE 289: I've graduated from university, and I'm working at the job I somehow
LINE 290: managed to find. I spend every day with the desperation of a man trying not to
LINE 291: be flung from a careening vehicle. There are times when I can believe I'm
LINE 292: getting closer, in very tiny increments, to the place I want to be.
LINE 293: In the morning, when I wake up, I stare at my right hand. There are little
LINE 294: drops of water on my index finger. By the time I notice them, both the dream I
LINE 295: was in a moment earlier and the tears that for an instant stained my eyes have
LINE 296: evaporated.
LINE 297: Just a little longer. With that thought, I get out of bed.
LINE 298: Just a little longer.
LINE 299: As I recite the wish, I face the mirror and tie my hair cord. I pull my arms
LINE 300: through the sleeves of my spring suit. I open the door of my apartment and, for
LINE 301: a moment, gaze at the Tokyo cityscape that unfurls before me. I climb the
LINE 302: station stairs, go through the automated turnstile, and board a packed commuter
LINE 303: train. The little patch of blue sky I can see beyond the heads of the crowd is
LINE 304: piercingly clear.
LINE 305: I lean against the train door, looking out. The city teems with people, in the
LINE 306: windows of buildings, in cars, on pedestrian bridges. A hundred people to a
LINE 307: car, a thousand people to a train, a thousand trains crisscrossing the city.
LINE 308: Gazing at them, I make my wish. Just a little longer.
LINE 309: In that instant, with absolutely no warning, I see her.
LINE 310: And then, I see him.
LINE 311: He's there, close enough to touch if it weren't for the windowpanes, on a
LINE 312: train running parallel to this one. He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are
LINE 313: wide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so
LINE 314: long really is.
LINE 315: She's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know
LINE 316: it's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes
LINE 317: between us, and I lose sight of her.
LINE 318: But I finally know what I'm wishing for.
LINE 319: I wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.
LINE 320: I want to be with him, just a little more.
LINE 321: The train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already
LINE 322: positive she's looking for me, too.
LINE 323: We've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an
LINE 324: assumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.
LINE 325: Even so, I—we—wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be
LINE 326: together, just a little more.
LINE 327: As I run along the sloping road, I wonder, Why am I running? Why am 1
LINE 328: searching? I probably know the answer. I don't remember it, but everything in
LINE 329: my body knows. I turn at a narrow alley, and the road drops off. Stairs. I walk
LINE 330: over to them, look down.. .and there he is.
LINE 331: Fighting back the urge to run, I climb the stairs slowly. A wind that smells
LINE 332: like flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the
LINE 333: top of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the
LINE 334: corner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts
LINE 335: softly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.
LINE 336: As we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say
LINE 337: anything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each
LINE 338: other. In that moment, I feel a tense, squeezing pain all over, as though
LINE 339: something inside me has taken hold of my heart. This is wrong, I think fiercely.
LINE 340: We can't possibly be strangers. It goes against something as basic as the
LINE 341: mechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...
LINE 342: And so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed. She's
LINE 343: standing on the stairs, the streets of Tokyo behind her, her eyes wide and round.
LINE 344: I realize her long hair is tied back with a cord the color of the evening sun. My
LINE 345: whole body trembles slightly.
LINE 346: I finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into
LINE 347: tears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.
LINE 348: Even as I cry, I smile, too. The spring air carries with it all sorts of
LINE 349: apprehension and anticipation, and I draw a deep breath.
LINE 350: Then we open our mouths at the same time.
LINE 351: Like children who've agreed to go on the count of three, we say together:
LINE 352: What's your name?
