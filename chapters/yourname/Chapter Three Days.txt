LINE 1: Chapter Three
LINE 2: Days
LINE 3: I don't recognize that ringtone , I think drowsily.
LINE 4: An alarm? But I'm still sleepy. And you know what, I'm going right back to
LINE 5: sleep. Eyes still shut, I grope for the smartphone I know I put beside my futon.
LINE 6: Huh?
LINE 7: I reach farther. Grr, that alarm is so noisy. Where'd I put it?
LINE 8: Ow!"
LINE 9: My back hits the floor with an emphatic thud. Apparently, I've managed to
LINE 10: fall out of bed. Ow, ow, ow, ow... Wait, what? Bed?
LINE 11: I finally open my eyes and sit up.
LINE 12: Huh?
LINE 13: The room is completely unfamiliar.
LINE 14: And I'min it.
LINE 15: Did I sleep over somewhere last night?
LINE 16: "...Where ami?"
LINE 17: The moment I murmur the words, I notice a strange heaviness in my throat.
LINE 18: By reflex, I put a hand to it. The throat my fingers find is hard and angular.
LINE 19: "Hmm?" My voice slips out again, and it's really low. I look down at myself.
LINE 20: .. .They're gone.
LINE 21: A T-shirt I've never seen before falls flat all the way to my stomach, and
LINE 22: they're not there.
LINE 23: My boobs are gone.
LINE 24: And right in the middle of my freakishly visible lower body, there's...
LINE 25: something. Something asserting its presence strongly enough to overwrite the
LINE 26: feeling of wrongness precipitated by my missing boobs.
LINE 27: What is...this?
LINE 28: Slowly, I extend my hand, reaching for that area. All the blood in my body
LINE 29: and all the skin over it is being pulled toward that one spot.
LINE 30: ...Is this, um...? L-location-wise, it's...
LINE 31: I touch it.
LINE 32: And very nearly pass out.
LINE 33: Who is this guy?
LINE 34: I'm gazing at a strange face in the mirror of a strange bathroom.
LINE 35: His slightly showy hairstyle brushes his eyebrows, apparently aiming for a
LINE 36: casual/calculated ratio of about 6:4. The eyebrows are stubborn-looking, but
LINE 37: his eyes are on the wide side and make him seem like a bit of a pushover. His
LINE 38: chapped lips seem completely unacquainted with the concept of moisturizer,
LINE 39: and his neck looks stiff. His cheeks are lean, with clean lines, and for some
LINE 40: reason, there's a big bandage on one of them. When I touch it gingerly, there's a
LINE 41: dull throb.
LINE 42: —But. Even though it hurts, I don't wake up. My throat is bone-dry. I twist
LINE 43: the faucet, fill my hands with tap water, and drink. It's unpleasantly warm and
LINE 44: smells like chemicals, like pool water.
LINE 45: "Taki, are you up?"
LINE 46: Abruptly, a man's voice calls from somewhere in the distance, and I give a
LINE 47: little shriek of alarm. Taki?
LINE 48: "Breakfast was your job today, kid. Remember? You overslept."
LINE 49: Nervously, I peek into what looks like a living room. As he speaks, a
LINE 50: middle-aged man in a suit glances at me, then immediately returns his attention
LINE 51: to the dishes.
LINE 52: "I-Tm sorry!"
LINE 53: I apologize out of habit.
LINE 54: "I'm heading out. There's miso soup—go ahead and finish it off."
LINE 55: "Um, yessir."
LINE 56: "And go to school. Even if you're late."
LINE 57: On that note, the man briskly piles up the dishes, puts them in the small
LINE 58: kitchen, passes by me as I stand petrified in the doorway, goes to the foyer,
LINE 59: dons his shoes, opens the door, steps out, and shuts it behind him. It all happens
LINE 60: so fast there'd have been barely enough time for a kite to call once.
LINE 61: ".. .What a weird dream," I say out loud.
LINE 62: I take another look around the room. There are photos and design sketches
LINE 63: of bridges and buildings and structures all over the walls. The floor is a
LINE 64: careless mess of magazines and paper bags and cardboard boxes. Compared to
LINE 65: the Miyamizu house, tidy as a venerable old Japanese inn (all thanks to Gran),
LINE 66: this place seems wild and lawless. The room is really small—probably a
LINE 67: condominium. If this is my dream, I have no idea where it came from, but I'm
LINE 68: impressed by how real it seems. I guess I've got a pretty good imagination.
LINE 69: Maybe I could be some kind of artist when I grow up.
LINE 70: Tweedle!
LINE 71: A text alert echoes from the depths of the hall with such impeccable timing
LINE 72: that it seems like a comeback. Eep! I gasp, hastily dashing back to the room
LINE 73: where the bed was. The smartphone's on the floor beside the sheets, and
LINE 74: there's a short message on its screen.
LINE 75: Are you still home? Get over here, run!
LINE 76: Tsukasa
LINE 77: Huh? What? What's this? Who in the world is Tsukasa?!
LINE 78: At any rate, I guess I have to go to school. I scan the room. My eyes stop on
LINE 79: a boy's uniform hanging beside the window, and as I pick it up, I'm suddenly
LINE 80: aware of another emergency.
LINE 81: Oh, for the love of...!
LINE 82: I need to pee.
LINE 83: Haaaaaah. I heave a sigh nearly strong enough to deflate my whole body.
LINE 84: What is wrong with guys' bodies, anyway?!
LINE 85: I managed to do my business somehow, but I'm still shaking with anger. The
LINE 86: harder I tried to pee, and the more I tried to aim it with my fingers, the more the
LINE 87: thing changed shape and the harder it got to go. What's up with that?! Are they
LINE 88: stupid?! Are they idiots?! Or is this guy weird?! Arrrgh! I'd never even seen
LINE 89: one of those before! And excuse me, but I'm technically a shrine maiden!
LINE 90: After I change into the uniform, keeping my head bent from the awful shame
LINE 91: and fighting back tears (I can't actually fight them all back, and a few slip out),
LINE 92: I open the condo's door. Well, for now, I'll just go, I think, and raise my head.
LINE 93: —And then.
LINE 94: My eyes are riveted.
LINE 95: The view before me leaves me breathless.
LINE 96: I'm standing on the outside corridor of a high-rise condo that's probably on
LINE 97: a hill.
LINE 98: Below lies a generous carpet of greenery, like a large park. The sky is a
LINE 99: vivid cerulean blue, without the slightest blemish. On the border between the
LINE 100: blue and green, ranks of buildings of all sizes line up neatly, like extra-intricate
LINE 101: origami. Each and every one is stamped with minute, exquisite windows like
LINE 102: the mesh of a net. Some of the windows reflect blue, others are tinted green,
LINE 103: and still others simply glitter in the morning sun. I can see a red tower, tiny
LINE 104: with distance, and a silver building whose rounded lines remind me vaguely of
LINE 105: a whale, and a shining black building that looks as though it's been cut from a
LINE 106: block of obsidian. I'm sure these buildings and several of the others are
LINE 107: famous—even I recognize some of them. Far away, little toy cars flow in neat,
LINE 108: orderly lines.
LINE 109: It's the scenery of the biggest city in Japan, and compared with what I'd
LINE 110: imagined, it's— Actually, come to think of it, I've never really tried to
LINE 111: visualize what it would be like before, but it's much, much more beautiful than
LINE 112: it looks in the movies and on TV It hits me hard, right in the chest.
LINE 113: "Tokyo," I murmur.
LINE 114: This world is far too dazzling. I inhale deeply and squint, as if looking at
LINE 115: the sun.
LINE 116: "Hey, where'd you buy this?" "In Nishi-Azabu, on the way home from
LINE 117: lessons." "Guess who's gonna be opening for their next big concert?" "Yo,
LINE 118: wanna skip club today and go catch a movie?" "An agency employee is coming
LINE 119: to the mixer tonight."
LINE 120: Wh-what's with these conversations? Are these people actually modern
LINE 121: Japanese high schoolers? Maybe they're just reading posts off some celebrity's
LINE 122: Facebook page?
LINE 123: I watch the classroom from where I'm standing, half-hidden behind the
LINE 124: door, timing my entrance. I used my smartphone's GPS to get here, and even
LINE 125: then, I got incredibly lost. By the time I found the school, the lunch bell was
LINE 126: already chiming away.
LINE 127: Still, this school— Glass windows that take up entire walls, bare concrete,
LINE 128: colorful iron doors with round windows... It's so abnormally fancy, I have to
LINE 129: wonder whether it's a World Expo venue or something. This Taki Tachibana
LINE 130: guy, a boy my age, lives in a world like this? I think of his name, which I found
LINE 131: in his student handbook, and his smug expression on his ID photo. They annoy
LINE 132: me a little.
LINE 133: "Taaaki!"
LINE 134: Somebody abruptly throws an arm around my shoulders from behind, and I
LINE 135: give a wordless yelp. When I look, a bespectacled CEO-type (only neat and
LINE 136: sophisticated) is smiling at me, close enough that our bangs are almost
LINE 137: touching. Eeeeeek! 'Scuse me, mister—this is the closest I've ever been to a
LINE 138: guy in my life!
LINE 139: "Look at you, showing up at noon. Let's go eat."
LINE 140: With that, the kid with glasses sets off down the hall, still hugging my
LINE 141: shoulders. No, seriously, you're way too close!
LINE 142: "Ignore my text, will you?" he accuses, but he doesn't sound mad. Then I
LINE 143: figure it out.
LINE 144: ".. .Excuse me... Wait, Tsukasa?"
LINE 145: "Ha-ha, 'excuse me'? Do I detect a note of contrition?"
LINE 146: I don't know how to respond to that, so for the moment, I quietly extricate
LINE 147: myself from his arm.
LINE 148: "...Yougot lost?"
LINE 149: Takagi—a big, good-natured guy—shouts, not bothering to hide his
LINE 150: astonishment.
LINE 151: "How the heck did you manage to get lost on the way to school?"
LINE 152: "Um..." I falter. The three of us are sitting in a corner of the wide rooftop.
LINE 153: It's supposed to be lunchtime right now, but there aren't many people around.
LINE 154: Maybe they're avoiding the summer sun.
LINE 155: 55
LINE 156: "Oh, um, 'scuse me—
LINE 157: '"'Scuseme'?"
LINE 158: Takagi and Tsukasa eye each other dubiously. Oops, that's right: I'm Taki
LINE 159: Tachibana now.
LINE 160: "Uh, I mean, um... Oh. Pardon me...?"
LINE 161: "Hunh?"
LINE 162: "Sorry."
LINE 163: "Say what?"
LINE 164: ".Whatever?"
LINE 165: Uh-huh, they nod, still looking bewildered. I see, so he's the "whatever"
LINE 166: type. Got it!
LINE 167: "I was just enjoyin' myself a little. Tokyo's kinda like a festival. Real
LINE 168: lively."
LINE 169: ".. .What's with the accent?" asks Takagi.
LINE 170: "Huh?!" I have an accent? I turn red.
LINE 171: "Taki, where's your lunch?" Tsukasa prods.
LINE 172: "Huh?!!" I didn't bring one!
LINE 173: As I hunt through my school bag, sweating bullets, they laugh. "Do you have
LINE 174: a fever or something?"
LINE 175: "Tsukasa, you got anything?"
LINE 176: "Egg sandwich. Let's stick that croquette of yours in here."
LINE 177: Here. The two of them hand me the improvised egg-croquette sandwich.
LINE 178: Their kindness touches my heart.
LINE 179: "Thank you..."
LINE 180: They both grin at me wordlessly. To think boys could be so stylish and
LINE 181: kind...! No, Mitsuha, don't do it! Don't fall for both of them at once! —Well,
LINE 182: no, I'm not falling for anybody, but Tokyo is fantastic, anyway!
LINE 183: "So listen, after class today, wanna go to that cafe again?" Takagi asks, and
LINE 184: without thinking, I stare at him as he takes a bite of rice.
LINE 185: "Yeah, good idea," Tsukasa replies. Taking a swig of water out of a plastic
LINE 186: bottle, his throat works smoothly. Huh? What? Where did he say we were
LINE 187: going?
LINE 188: "What about you, Taki? You're coming, right?"
LINE 189: "Huh?!"
LINE 190: "To the cafe."
LINE 191: "C-c-cafeeeee?!"
LINE 192: The furrows between their eyebrows deepen, but I ignore it. My mood is
LINE 193: soaring, and I can't repress my excitement. This is it! Who's laughing now, bus
LINE 194: stop cafe?!
LINE 195: Two tiny dogs dressed in pop idol-style outfits are sitting on a wicker
LINE 196: chair, watching me with eyes like candy drops and wagging their tails so hard
LINE 197: they seem liable to come off. There's an incredible amount of space between
LINE 198: each table, and fully half the customers are foreign. A third are wearing
LINE 199: sunglasses, three-fifths are wearing hats, and not one is wearing a suit. There's
LINE 200: no telling what any of them do for a living.
LINE 201: What is this place? Adults go to cafes with their little dogs on weekdays, in
LINE 202: broad daylight?!
LINE 203: "I like the timberwork on the ceiling."
LINE 204: "Yeah. They put serious effort into that."
LINE 205: Tsukasa and Takagi don't seem the least bit intimidated by this supremely
LINE 206: trendy space. They're smiling and discussing their impressions of the interior.
LINE 207: Apparently, these boys are touring different cafes because they're interested in
LINE 208: architecture. What kind of hobby is that?! Aren't high school guys into
LINE 209: magazines like MU7\
LINE 210: "Taki, do you know what you want?"
LINE 211: Prompted by Tsukasa, I stop dissecting the cafe and let my eyes fall to the
LINE 212: heavy, leather-bound menu.
LINE 213: ..! I—I could live for a month on how much these pancakes cost!"
LINE 214: "What era are you from, again?" Takagi laughs.
LINE 215: "Umm..."
LINE 216: I stress about it for a little while and then remember: Oh. Right. This is a
LINE 217: dream. Well, in that case, why not? It's Taki Tachibana's money anyway. I'll
LINE 218: just eat whatever I want.
LINE 219: Ahhhh, what a great dream...
LINE 220: The pancakes are the heavyweight kind, a fortress solidly flanked by things
LINE 221: like mango and blueberries. After finishing them, I sip cinnamon coffee, deeply
LINE 222: satisfied.
LINE 223: Tweedle.
LINE 224: The smartphone in my pocket chirps... Huh. There are an awful lot of
LINE 225: angry-vein symbols in this text.
LINE 226: .. Agh! What'll I do? It says I'm late for work! Somebody who's probably
LINE 227: my boss is mad at me!"
LINE 228: "Wait, you had a shift today?" asks Takagi.
LINE 229: "You better hurry and go, then," says Tsukasa.
LINE 230: "Right!" I hastily stand. Oh, but...
LINE 231: "What's up?"
LINE 232: "Umm... Where do I work again?"
LINE 233: ".Say what?"
LINE 234: The two boys have soared past disgust. They seem about ready to snap.
LINE 235: Gimme a break. I know absolutely nothing about this guy!
LINE 236: "Excuse me—isn't our order ready yet?"
LINE 237: "Taki! Go take table twelve's order!"
LINE 238: "This isn't what I asked for."
LINE 239: "Taki! I told you, we're out of the truffles!"
LINE 240: "Is our check ready yet?"
LINE 241: "Taki, you're in the way! Move!"
LINE 242: "Taki, you idiot, do your job!"
LINE 243: "Taki!"
LINE 244: The place is a dauntingly ritzy Italian restaurant.
LINE 245: It's a two-story building that's open all the way up, atrium-style. The
LINE 246: ceiling is hung with sparkling chandeliers, and there are big propellers up
LINE 247: there, too, spinning slowly. I've seen something like them in a movie. Taki
LINE 248: Tachibana is a bow tie-wearing waiter, and at dinnertime, the restaurant is
LINE 249: hellishly busy.
LINE 250: I'm being swept this way and that by a muddy torrent of confusion, getting
LINE 251: orders wrong, serving them wrong, getting tske d at by customers and yelled at
LINE 252: by the chefs. Come on, people, I've never worked here before! Actually, I've
LINE 253: never worked a part-time job before, period! This is a total nightmare!
LINE 254: Waaaah, seriously, when am I gonna wake up?! This is all your fault, stupid
LINE 255: Taki Tachibana!
LINE 256: "—'Scuse me. You. Boy."
LINE 257: "Huh? Uh, yes?!"
LINE 258: I've already gone a little ways past the customer who flagged me down,
LINE 259: and I turn back hastily. How am I supposed to know to respond to "boy," huh?
LINE 260: Wow. The man's an obvious thug, complete with open-collared shirt, gold
LINE 261: chain, and lots of clunky rings. Still, if you go to the next city over from my
LINE 262: town, there are a lot of guys like him hanging out in front of the station. His
LINE 263: type feels a little more familiar to me than the celebrity-esque luster of the
LINE 264: other customers. When he speaks, there's a thin smarm in his voice:
LINE 265: "Listen. There was a toothpick in my pizza."
LINE 266: "Huh?"
LINE 267: Mr. Thug picks up the very last slice of basil pizza with his fingertips.
LINE 268: There's a toothpick sticking out of the edge where it was sliced, basically
LINE 269: screaming that someone jabbed it in there after the fact. Maybe he's joking
LINE 270: around with me. I'm bewildered, unsure how to respond, and Mr. Thug
LINE 271: continues with a seemingly fixed smile.
LINE 272: "It woulda been bad if I'd eaten that, right? We're just lucky I noticed it.
LINE 273: What're you gonna do?"
LINE 274: "Huh...?"
LINE 275: I get the feeling I really can't afford to say, You really stuck that in there
LINE 276: yourself right, sir? I give a noncommittal smile instead... Conversely, his
LINE 277: fades.
LINE 278: "I'm asking you what you're gonna do about it?!"
LINE 279: Crash! All of a sudden, he kicks the table up with his knee and starts
LINE 280: yelling. Instantly, the murmur of conversation freezes. I tense up, too.
LINE 281: "—Sir! Is something the matter?"
LINE 282: A woman appears and pushes me out of the way. She glances at me and
LINE 283: whispers, "I've got this!"
LINE 284: Someone else grabs my arm from behind and drags me away—a waiter
LINE 285: who's probably worked there longer than me. "You're acting pretty weird
LINE 286: today," he says, looking concerned.
LINE 287: "I'm terribly sorry about that, sir!" Out of the corner of my eye, I see the
LINE 288: woman bowing deeply to the thug.
LINE 289: The background hum returns, as if someone's twisted the volume backup.
LINE 290: I'm pushing an industrial vacuum cleaner that's as big as a lawn mower
LINE 291: over the floor. The restaurant's finally closed. The lights in the chandeliers
LINE 292: have dimmed, and all the tables have been stripped. One employee polishes
LINE 293: glasses, another checks the stock in the refrigerator, and somebody else is
LINE 294: doing something with the computers at the cashier counter.
LINE 295: The woman who rescued me is wiping down the tables one by one. For a
LINE 296: little while now, Fve been trying—and failing—to find an opportunity to speak
LINE 297: to her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and
LINE 298: I can't read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a
LINE 299: gentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small—and
LINE 300: yet she's got big boobs. She's just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I
LINE 301: catch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.
LINE 302: Perfect!
LINE 303: "Miss Okudera?"
LINE 304: Just as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the
LINE 305: head.
LINE 306: "That's senpai to you!" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He
LINE 307: goes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got
LINE 308: seniority on me. Okay!
LINE 309: "Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really..."
LINE 310: "Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?"
LINE 311: As she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes
LINE 312: curve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of
LINE 313: beauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel
LINE 314: compelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look
LINE 315: down.
LINE 316: "Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just..."
LINE 317: "That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let
LINE 318: him have his food for free, but..."
LINE 319: She doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping
LINE 320: down another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...
LINE 321: "Eek! Okudera-senpai!"
LINE 322: Another waitress cries out.
LINE 323: "Your skirt!"
LINE 324: "Hmm?"
LINE 325: Miss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now
LINE 326: that I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a
LINE 327: shocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.
LINE 328: "Are you hurt?"
LINE 329: "Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?"
LINE 330: "I think something like that's happened before..."
LINE 331: "Was someone harassing you?"
LINE 332: "Do you remember the guy's face?"
LINE 333: Several staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.
LINE 334: Eyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the
LINE 335: words I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I
LINE 336: see little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.
LINE 337: This time, I need to rescue her.
LINE 338: The thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,
LINE 339: I've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my
LINE 340: back ("Hey! Taki, you little..."), but I ignore them.
LINE 341: The green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at
LINE 342: least one more design element. The brown is— Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The
LINE 343: cream is for its nose.
LINE 344: Pinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For
LINE 345: some reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing
LINE 346: room sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate
LINE 347: repair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly
LINE 348: good at.
LINE 349: "All done!"
LINE 350: I hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to
LINE 351: finish.
LINE 352: "...Huh? This is..."
LINE 353: The dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing
LINE 354: room quickly shifts to surprise.
LINE 355: "This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!"
LINE 356: The tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so
LINE 357: as I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.
LINE 358: The skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought
LINE 359: being a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like
LINE 360: Okudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but
LINE 361: when she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the
LINE 362: neighborhood.
LINE 363: "You really saved me today. Thank you very much."
LINE 364: I finally managed to say it.
LINE 365: "Heh-heh!" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.
LINE 366: "To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but
LINE 367: you're always so quick to fight."
LINE 368: As she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I
LINE 369: grasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.
LINE 370: "I like this version of you better," Okudera-senpai says, a bit
LINE 371: mischievously. "You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki."
LINE 372: My heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It
LINE 373: makes me want to give her everything I have for free. I think it's the most
LINE 374: precious thing I've seen in Tokyo today.
LINE 375: The yellow train I take to get home is empty.
LINE 376: By now, I've realized that Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.
LINE 377: Convenience stores, family restaurants, the people I pass, the edge of the park,
LINE 378: construction sites, the station at night, the inside of the train... Almost every ten
LINE 379: steps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced
LINE 380: smells when gathered in one place.
LINE 381: And for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person
LINE 382: living in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that
LINE 383: stretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the
LINE 384: overwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.
LINE 385: Taki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand
LINE 386: toward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but
LINE 387: I guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,
LINE 388: as if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know
LINE 389: "Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself."
LINE 390: Back at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this
LINE 391: morning.
LINE 392: I'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1
LINE 393: had! Isn't that amazin '? Aren't you awed by my fantastic imagination?! It s
LINE 394: like I actually went to Tokyo! I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist—or no, wait,
LINE 395: I'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll
LINE 396: probably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?
LINE 397: Fantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick
LINE 398: up Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my
LINE 399: fingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary
LINE 400: [9/7 Ate at KFC with Tsukasa and Co.] [9/6
LINE 401: Movie in Hibiya] [8/31 Architecture Tour—
LINE 402: Bayside Edition] [8/25 Payday!]
LINE 403: As I scroll backward through the headers, I'm impressed in spite of myself.
LINE 404: "He's real thorough." Then I tap the photo app. Most of the pictures are
LINE 405: landscapes. After those, the majority are of him with Tsukasa and Takagi.
LINE 406: Eating ramen together, going to the park together... They sure are close. A beet
LINE 407: bowl place, a soba shop at the station, a trendy hamburger joint. The road
LINE 408: home from school. Sunset through the gaps between the buildings. His friends'
LINE 409: backs. Jet contrails in the sky overhead.
LINE 410: "Lucky him, livin' in Tokyo..."
LINE 411: As I murmur, a yawn slips out. Starting to get sleepy, I go to the next photo.
LINE 412: "Oh, it's Okudera-senpai."
LINE 413: The picture is of her back as she's cleaning the restaurant window, and it
LINE 414: feels like a candid shot. In the next, she's noticed and turned to face the
LINE 415: camera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.
LINE 416: ...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It's bound to be
LINE 417: unrequited, though. She's in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.
LINE 418: I sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in
LINE 419: everything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but
LINE 420: connected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from
LINE 421: work, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in
LINE 422: the entry, wanting to report it—or brag about it—to Taki Tachibana. Once I'm
LINE 423: done, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...
LINE 424: Who are you?
LINE 425: For some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.
LINE 426: Vaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room
LINE 427: in Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something
LINE 428: oddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the
LINE 429: palm of my hand, I write:
LINE 430: Mitsuha
LINE 431: Yaaaawwn...
LINE 432: That's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,
LINE 433: thrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored
LINE 434: shower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to
LINE 435: finish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the
LINE 436: writing on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.
LINE 437: + + +
LINE 438: "...What is this?"
LINE 439: I say the words aloud, despite myself. I'm staring at my hand.
LINE 440: Finally, I let my eyes drop from the letters on my palm down to my
LINE 441: wrinkled uniform and necktie... So, what—I fell asleep without changing?
LINE 442: "—Wh.. .wh-what is this?!"
LINE 443: This time, I actually yell. We're having breakfast, and my dad glances at me
LINE 444: but promptly loses interest and returns his attention to his bowl. I stare at my
LINE 445: phone, stunned. There's a really long journal entry on it that I don't remember
LINE 446: writing.
LINE 447: ...And on the way home from work, Okudera-
LINE 448: senpai and I walked to the station together, just
LINE 449: the two of us! It's all because I'm in touch with
LINE 450: my feminine side.
LINE 451: "Taki, want to hit another cafe today?"
LINE 452: "Uh, sorry, I've got work after this."
LINE 453: "Ha-ha. You know where to go?"
LINE 454: "Huh? .. .Hey! Tsukasa, you jerk, was that you?"
LINE 455: I raise my voice without meaning to. Actually, I wish it was him. Tsukasa's
LINE 456: puzzled expression tells me it wasn't, though. Even I know there's no reason
LINE 457: somebody'd go to all that trouble for a prank.
LINE 458: Getting up from my chair, I reluctantly excuse myself:
LINE 459: ".. .Nah, never mind. See ya."
LINE 460: As I leave the classroom, I hear Takagi's voice behind me. Dude's back to
LINE 461: normal today.
LINE 462: An uneasy shiver shoots through me, and my feet get cold. Something very
LINE 463: weird is happening to me.
LINE 464: "...Wh-what?"
LINE 465: After I change into my work clothes, three of my senior coworkers are
LINE 466: standing outside the changing room when I open the door, blocking my way.
LINE 467: There's one regular staffer and two college part-timers, all guys, and they're
LINE 468: glaring at me with eyes that look bloodshot or maybe teary... Either way, not
LINE 469: good. I swallow hard, and the three of them start in on me in menacing tones.
LINE 470: "Taki, you scumbag, whaddaya think you're doing, getting a jump on us?"
LINE 471: "You'd better have an excuse, weasel." "You two left together yesterday,
LINE 472: didn't you?"
LINE 473: "Huh... Wait, no way—seriously?! I did? With Okudera-senpai?!"
LINE 474: Meaning that journal entry was real?!
LINE 475: "What happened with you two after that?!"
LINE 476: "Uh, no, I.. .1 really don't remember much..."
LINE 477: "Don't gimme that crap!"
LINE 478: Just as it looks like somebody's gonna haul me up by my shirtfront, a cool
LINE 479: voice echoes through the hall.
LINE 480: "Okudera, reporting for duty."
LINE 481: Okudera-senpai arrives, her long, bare legs and the shoulders peeking out
LINE 482: of her top gleaming in the light. She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals
LINE 483: clicking pleasantly.
LINE 484: "Hello, everyone."
LINE 485: "Hi!"
LINE 486: She's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning
LINE 487: presence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about
LINE 488: our problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.
LINE 489: "Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?"
LINE 490: I can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly
LINE 491: delivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the
LINE 492: door. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.
LINE 493: This is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until
LINE 494: they shine, right this minute.
LINE 495: ".Hey. Taki."
LINE 496: The guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the
LINE 497: depths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.
LINE 498: —Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I
LINE 499: wonder:
LINE 500: What's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...
LINE 501: Nah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?
LINE 502: What the heck is "Mitsuha "?
LINE 503: The birds are energetically twittering away again this morning. There's a
LINE 504: newborn clarity to the early sun that streams in through the paper sliding doors,
LINE 505: and the morning is peaceful, as usual. Even so, although I've just woken up,
LINE 506: unfamiliar writing with a quality of pure, concentrated irritation is scrawled
LINE 507: across my arm.
LINE 508: Mitsuha??? What are you? Who are you????
LINE 509: The letters are big and messy, written roughly with a super-thick Magic
LINE 510: Marker, from my palm all the way up to my elbow.
LINE 511: "Sis, what is that?"
LINE 512: When I look up, Yotsuha's standing in the open sliding door. I make a face
LINE 513: that says, That's what I want to know.
LINE 514: My little sister's face replies, Well, it doesn't really matter.
LINE 515: "You're not feelin' up your boobs today, huh? Break! Fast! Time! Hurry
LINE 516: up!"
LINE 517: She shuts the sliding door with a sharp clack , just like always, and I watch
LINE 518: her from my futon. Huh? Boobs? I'm "not feeling them up today"? ...Excuse
LINE 519: me? My mind produces a gratuitous image of myself happily squeezing my own
LINE 520: boobs... B-but that's so perverted and gross!
LINE 521: "Mornin'!" I say as I enter the classroom.
LINE 522: The minute I do, all my classmates' eyes are on me. Eep! I give a little
LINE 523: gasp. Wh-what? Trying to make myself small and inconspicuous, I cross to my
LINE 524: seat by the window. I hear whispers.
LINE 525: "Miyamizuwas really cool yesterday, huh."
LINE 526: "Uh-huh. I didn't think she had it in her."
LINE 527: "Her personality's kinda changed, though, yeah?"
LINE 528: "U-um, people are lookin' at me..."
LINE 529: "Well, what did you expect? After what you pulled yesterday, they can't
LINE 530: help it," says Saya.
LINE 531: "'What I pulled yesterday'?" I ask, sitting down.
LINE 532: Saya peers into my face, looking puzzled and worried.
LINE 533: —You know.. .durin' art yesterday, when we were sketchin' that still life.
LINE 534: Huh? You really don't remember? Again? Honestly, Mitsuha, are you okay?
LINE 535: You and me were in the same group. We were supposed to be drawin' the vase
LINE 536: and the apples—y'know, the subject that doesn't make any sense. Except you
LINE 537: sketched a landscape instead. Well, that bit doesn't matter. Anyway,
LINE 538: Matsumoto's group was behind us, and they were talkin' nasty, the way they
LINE 539: always do.
LINE 540: What, you want to know? Um, well, about the mayoral election.
LINE 541: Huh? Details? Oh, you know, how the town administration is all just
LINE 542: figurin' out how to hand out subsidies, and it's the same no matter who does it,
LINE 543: but how there are "some kids" whose livelihood depends on it, et cetera.
LINE 544: Dumb stuff like that. When you heard them, you said, "That's me they're talkin'
LINE 545: about, right?" So I said I thought it probably was. I mean, if you ask me, I'm
LINE 546: gonna answer, right? Then, Mitsuha, what do you suppose you did?
LINE 547: You seriously don't remember? You kicked the desk with the vase on it
LINE 548: right toward Matsumoto's group! And with a great big grin on your face!
LINE 549: Matsumoto and the others got scared, and of course, the vase broke, and the
LINE 550: whole class went dead quiet. Actually, you gave me the chills, too!
LINE 551: "Wh-wh-what in the world?"
LINE 552: I turn pale. After school, I run straight home. Yotsuha and Gran are in the
LINE 553: living room, drinking tea without a care in the world. Glancing at them out of
LINE 554: the corner of my eye, I run up the stairs, shut myself in my room, and open my
LINE 555: classics notebook. Who are you? it still reads. I turn a few more pages.
LINE 556: My skin crawls. Now there's a whole two pages filled with small letters in
LINE 557: the same handwriting. First, in big letters, Mitsuha Miyamizu. Then there are
LINE 558: lots of question marks around it and bits of personal information about me.
LINE 559: Year 2, Class 3 / Teshigawara friend, occult geek,
LINE 560: dumb but a good guy / Sayaka £, friend, quiet, kinda
LINE 561: cute
LINE 562: Lives with her grandma and her little sister Yotsuha /
LINE 563: Way out in the sticks / Her dad is mayor / She's a shrine
LINE 564: maiden? / Sounds like her mom is dead / Her dad
LINE 565: doesn't live with them / Doesn't have many friends /
LINE 566: Has boobs
LINE 567: Then, in larger letters, What the heck is this life??
LINE 568: I stare at the notebook. I'm trembling. The scenery of Tokyo shimmers in my
LINE 569: mind, as faint as a rising haze. Cafes, a part-time job, guy friends, walking
LINE 570: home with someone...
LINE 571: A corner of my heart catches the tail of an impossible conclusion.
LINE 572: "Is this...? Could we be...?"
LINE 573: "Is this seriously...?"
LINE 574: I'm holed up in my room, staring at my phone in denial. For a while now,
LINE 575: my fingers have been shaking as if they partly belong to somebody else as I
LINE 576: scroll through the entries in my journal app. Sandwiched between the ones I
LINE 577: wrote, there are several headers I don't remember.
LINE 578: First y Harajuku-Omotesando panini-rama! / At
LINE 579: Odaiba aquarium with two boys / Observation
LINE 580: platform tour and flea market^ / Visited father's
LINE 581: workplace Kasumigaseki District!
LINE 582: A corner of my mind catches the tail of an inconceivable conclusion.
LINE 583: Could this be...?
LINE 584: In my dreams, are this girl and I—
LINE 585: In my dreams, are this boy and I—
LINE 586: —switching bodies?!
LINE 587: + +
LINE 588: The sun rises from the edge of the mountains. Little by little, the daylight
LINE 589: washes over the lake town. The birds in the morning, the hush at midday, the
LINE 590: insect songs in the evening, the glitter of the night sky.
LINE 591: The sun rises between the buildings. Little by little, the daylight glints oft
LINE 592: countless windows. The throngs of people in the morning, the hum of midday,
LINE 593: the scents of everyday life at half-light, the sparkle of the streets at night.
LINE 594: Over and over, we're captivated by moments like these.
LINE 595: And, gradually, we learn.
LINE 596: Taki Tachibana—Taki—is a high school kid my age who lives in Tokyo,
LINE 597: and...
LINE 598: At irregular intervals, unexpectedly, two or three times a week, I swap
LINE 599: bodies with Mitsuha Miyamizu, who lives way out in the sticks. It triggers
LINE 600: when we fall asleep. We have no idea what causes it.
LINE 601: Our memories of the time we spend switched fade as soon as we wake up.
LINE 602: It feels like a lucid dream.
LINE 603: Even so, we're definitely swapping. The reactions of the people around us
LINE 604: prove it more than anything.
LINE 605: Now that we're aware that we are actually switching with each other,
LINE 606: we're starting to hold on to bits of memories from the dreams. For example, at
LINE 607: this point, even when I'm awake, I know there's a boy named Taki who lives in
LINE 608: Tokyo.
LINE 609: Now I'm positive there's a girl named Mitsuha living in a country town
LINE 610: somewhere. I don't have any solid evidence or rational explanation, but I have
LINE 611: this strange sense that tells me it's real.
LINE 612: We've also started communicating with each other. On the days when we
LINE 613: switch, we leave diary entries or notes on each other's smartphones.
LINE 614: We've tried texting and calling, too, but for some reason, neither of us
LINE 615: could get through. Anyway, we're lucky we figured out a way to communicate
LINE 616: at all. We both need to keep each other's lives intact and undisturbed... So we
LINE 617: set rules.
LINE 618: <To Taki—Don'ts List #1>
LINE 619: • Absolutely no baths, ever.
LINE 620: • Do not look at or touch my body.
LINE 621: • When you sit, keep your legs together.
LINE 622: • Don't get too friendly with Tesshi. Try to get
LINE 623: him and Saya together.
LINE 624: • Don't touch other boys.
LINE 625: • Don't touch the girls, either.
LINE 626: <To Mitsuha—Don'ts List Ver. 5>
LINE 627: • I told you before, don't waste my money.
LINE 628: Remember?
LINE 629: • Don't be late for school or work. Learn how to
LINE 630: get there already.
LINE 631: • Don't talk with an accent.
LINE 632: • Are you sneaking baths? I think I smell
LINE 633: shampoo...
LINE 634: • Don't get cuddly with Tsukasa, you idiot.
LINE 635: People will get the wrong idea.
LINE 636: • Don't get too friendly with Okudera-senpai, I'm
LINE 637: begging you.
LINE 638: —But still... I grit my teeth reading another of Mitsuha's journal entries.
LINE 639: Reading Taki's entry in my diary, my blood starts to boil. Honestly, I swear,
LINE 640: this is just completely...
LINE 641: That guy...
LINE 642: is such a...!
LINE 643: That girl...
LINE 644: You "tore up the court" playing basketball in
LINE 645: gym?! That's not me at all! Not only that, what
LINE 646: are you doing jumping and bouncing around in
LINE 647: front of the boys?! Saya even yelled at me and
LINE 648: told me to keep my chest and stomach and legs
LINE 649: covered properly! Male gazes! Watch your skirt!
LINE 650: This is very basic stuff!!
LINE 651: ▼
LINE 652: Mitsuha, you twit, don't go scarfing down crazy-
LINE 653: expensive cakes! You're freaking outTsukasa and
LINE 654: the other guys, and that's my money!
LINE 655: ▼
LINE 656: It's your body eating them, Taki! Besides, I'm
LINE 657: working at that restaurant, too! Plus, you're
LINE 658: taking too many shifts. I can't do anything fun
LINE 659: this way.
LINE 660: Y
LINE 661: That's because you keep burning through my
LINE 662: money! And seriously, no matter what I do, I
LINE 663: can't make those braided cords with your
LINE 664: grandma!
LINE 665: Y
LINE 666: On the way home, Okudera-senpai and I stopped
LINE 667: and had tea! I tried to buy hers for her, but she
LINE 668: paid for mine instead. "Take me out when you
LINE 669: graduate from high school," she said! Can you
LINE 670: believe that? "That's a promise," I told her, all
LINE 671: cool-like. Your relationship is blossoming, so,
LINE 672: you're welcome.
LINE 673: Y
LINE 674: Mitsuha, what the hell do you think you're
LINE 675: doing?! Don't go messing with my relationships!
LINE 676: Y
LINE 677: Taki! What is this love letter?! Why is some guy I
LINE 678: don't know confessing to me?! Why did you tell
LINE 679: him you'd "think about it"?!
LINE 680: Ha-ha. You aren't using your assets at all.
LINE 681: Don'cha think you'd be more popular if you let
LINE 682: me run your life?
LINE 683: Y
LINE 684: Don't get full of yourself! You don't even have a
LINE 685: girlfriend!
LINE 686: ▼
LINE 687: You don't have anybody, either!
LINE 688: Y
LINE 689: It's not that... I don't have one—I'm just not
LINE 690: looking!
LINE 691: It's not that...
LINE 692: -k- +
LINE 693: That's Mitsuha's ringtone.
LINE 694: Meaning, I'm living in the country today, I think sleepily. Awesome. I'll
LINE 695: get to put in some more time on the cafe project I'm working on with
LINE 696: Teshigawara after school. Yeah, and also—
LINE 697: I sit up on the futon and look down at my body.
LINE 698: Mitsuha's pajamas have gotten really conservative lately. She used to sleep
LINE 699: in a baggy nightshirt without a bra. This morning, though, she's wearing
LINE 700: underwear that's kinda constricting and this shirt that's buttoned up all the way.
LINE 701: There's no telling when we're gonna swap, so she's being careful. Well, I get
LINE 702: that. I do. But.
LINE 703: I reach for her breasts. This is my body today. Nothing wrong with
LINE 704: touching my own body, I think, just like always. Only. Except. But...
LINE 705: My hands pause, and I mutter quietly:
LINE 706: ".. .Guess I shouldn't."
LINE 707: The sliding door rattles open.
LINE 708: ".You really do like your boobs, don't you. Sis?"
LINE 709: That's all the little sister says before closing the sliding door. I watch her
LINE 710: go.. .while kneading my breasts.
LINE 711: .. .This is okay, right? From on top of her clothes. Just a little.
LINE 712: "Graaaaan. Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?"
LINE 713: Yotsuha whines.
LINE 714: Gran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.
LINE 715: "Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either."
LINE 716: Mayugorou?
LINE 717: ".. .Who's that?" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.
LINE 718: "Huh? Youdunno? He's famous."
LINE 719: Famous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.
LINE 720: The three Miyamizu women—me, the grandma, and Yotsuha—have been
LINE 721: hiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're
LINE 722: taking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.
LINE 723: These people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.
LINE 724: The sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.
LINE 725: The air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the
LINE 726: pleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in
LINE 727: this town now.
LINE 728: Come to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.
LINE 729: The thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this
LINE 730: mountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong
LINE 731: walker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've
LINE 732: never lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what
LINE 733: kind of shape she's in.
LINE 734: "Hey, Grandma!"
LINE 735: I break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this
LINE 736: little old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really
LINE 737: good lunches.
LINE 738: "Let me piggyback you. If you want..."
LINE 739: "Oh, may I?" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto
LINE 740: my back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at
LINE 741: somebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,
LINE 742: warm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs
LINE 743: nothing.
LINE 744: "Grandma, you're way light— Whoa!"
LINE 745: The moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.
LINE 746: Yotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, "Come on, Sis!" Come to think of it,
LINE 747: Mitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the
LINE 748: world this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.
LINE 749: "Mitsuha, Yotsuha."
LINE 750: I hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.
LINE 751: "Are you familiar with musubiT '
LINE 752: " MusubiT '
LINE 753: Yotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to
LINE 754: her stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole
LINE 755: round lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from
LINE 756: climbing with her grandma on her back.
LINE 757: "In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of
LINE 758: spirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's."
LINE 759: Guardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old
LINE 760: lady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and
LINE 761: it's oddly persuasive.
LINE 762: "Did you know?" she starts again. "Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'
LINE 763: people is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the
LINE 764: same word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the
LINE 765: braided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself."
LINE 766: I can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I
LINE 767: think.
LINE 768: "Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'
LINE 769: undone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's
LINE 770: musubi ."
LINE 771: Without really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up
LINE 772: against rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a
LINE 773: whole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,
LINE 774: but I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I
LINE 775: wake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,
LINE 776: falling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry
LINE 777: mountain.
LINE 778: "Here, drink up."
LINE 779: We take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.
LINE 780: It's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,
LINE 781: and I drain two cups in a row. "C'mon! Me too!" Yotsuha pesters. This may be
LINE 782: the best drink I've ever had.
LINE 783: "That's another musubi."
LINE 784: "Huh?"
LINE 785: As I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.
LINE 786: She's sitting at the base of a tree.
LINE 787: "Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also
LINE 788: called musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your
LINE 789: soul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition
LINE 790: meant to connect the god and humans to each other, a custom that the Miyamizu
LINE 791: family has observed for centuries."
LINE 792: Before I notice, the trees end, and the lake town below us—now about the
LINE 793: size of a sketchbook—is half-hidden beneath the clouds. When I look up, the
LINE 794: wisps of cloud still overhead seem paper-thin, transparent and shining.
LINE 795: They're flowing rapidly into the distance and dissolving in the strong wind.
LINE 796: We're in a rocky area where only moss grows. We've finally reached the peak.
LINE 797: "I see it, I see it!"
LINE 798: Yotsuha's skipping around. I catch up to her and follow her gaze. Ahead,
LINE 799: there's a crater-like basin about the size of an athletic field, as if the top of the
LINE 800: mountain has been gouged out. The inside is a green, marshy area, and near its
LINE 801: center stands a massive, solitary tree.
LINE 802: I'd never even imagined a view like this one, and I stare.
LINE 803: It's almost like a natural floating garden. You'd never be able to see it from
LINE 804: the town. The boondocks are all kinds of awesome.
LINE 805: "This is the edge of the other side," the old lady says.
LINE 806: We've gone down to the basin floor, and there's a little brook flowing in
LINE 807: front of us. The big tree is beyond.
LINE 808: "Other side?" Yotsuha and I say together.
LINE 809: "The hidden world, the next world."
LINE 810: The next world. Grandma's folktale voice strokes my back like a cold
LINE 811: wind. My feet falter just a little. A sacred mountain, or a power spot, or a save
LINE 812: point—whatever it is, the atmosphere saturating it really does seem to belong
LINE 813: to some other world.
LINE 814: This better not be one of those places that doesn't let you leave once you go
LINE 815: in.
LINE 816: "Yaaaay, it's the next world!"
LINE 817: Yotsuha whoops and splashes across the little stream. Kids are really
LINE 818: something, all dumb and full of energy. Well, the weather's nice, and the wind
LINE 819: and the brook are both peaceful. I'd probably be embarrassed later if I got cold
LINE 820: feet over something like this. I take the old lady's hand so she won't get wet,
LINE 821: and we cross the brook on the stepping-stones.
LINE 822: "In order to return to our world...," the old lady begins, suddenly sounding
LINE 823: solemn, "you two must leave behind what's most precious to you."
LINE 824: "Huh?!" In spite of myself, my voice gets shrill.
LINE 825: "W-wait, Grandma—don't say that after we're already here!"
LINE 826: The old woman smiles at my protest, and her eyes squinch up. I can see the
LINE 827: gaps where she's missing teeth, and it's really creepy.
LINE 828: "There's nothin' to fear. I meant the sake. Take it out," the old lady instructs,
LINE 829: and both Yotsuha and I remove small urns from our backpacks. They're the
LINE 830: kind of thing you tend to see on Shinto altars in people's houses. Made of
LINE 831: glossy white ceramic, their rounded shapes are a few inches across, and they
LINE 832: widen into a pedestal at the base. The lids are sealed with braided cords, and I
LINE 833: can hear liquid splashing inside.
LINE 834: "Below the god's body," Grandma says, gazing at the enormous tree,
LINE 835: "there's a little shrine. Offer them there. That sake is half of you, you see."
LINE 836: Half of Mitsuha.
LINE 837: I look at the urn in my hands. It's that special sake, the stuff she made by
LINE 838: chewing up rice. This sake was made by "binding" rice and this body... And
LINE 839: I'm the one offering it. Feeling awkward—like I'm about to score a goal off a
LINE 840: pass from someone I've been fighting with—but at the same time strangely
LINE 841: proud, I start toward the great tree.
LINE 842: This might be the first time I've heard real evening cicadas.
LINE 843: I know what they are because it's the sound effect they always use for
LINE 844: evening in movies and games. Their melancholy, wavering song echoes all
LINE 845: around me—everywhere—and it makes this whole experience seem a lot more
LINE 846: movielike than an actual movie.
LINE 847: There's a loud rustling, and a flock of sparrows bursts out of the brush right
LINE 848: in front of me. Having been under the impression that birds just hung out in
LINE 849: trees, I'm startled, but Yotsuha runs after them, twirling around and around. She
LINE 850: looks like she's having fun. We must be pretty close to the town—there are
LINE 851: faint dinnertime smells on the wind. The idea that it's possible to so clearly
LINE 852: distinguish the scents of everyday human life surprises me a little.
LINE 853: "It's already half-light."
LINE 854: Having completed the day's formal business, Yotsuha sounds relieved, like
LINE 855: she's finally finished her homework. The evening sun lights up the girl and the
LINE 856: old lady sidelong, like a spotlight. It's almost too picture-perfect.
LINE 857: "Whoa...!"
LINE 858: The sight of the village coming into view below us makes me exhale
LINE 859: despite myself. I can see Mitsuha's entire town around the edge of the lake.
LINE 860: Blue shadows have already engulfed the town itself, but the lake yawning
LINE 861: beside reflects the red sky. On the hillsides here and there, pink evening mists
LINE 862: are gathering. Dinner smoke rises from several houses, trailing high and thin,
LINE 863: like smoke signals. The sparrows skimming through the air over the town
LINE 864: gleam randomly, like motes of dust after school.
LINE 865: "Think we'll be able to see the comet soon?"
LINE 866: Yotsuha is searching the sky, blocking out the setting sun with her palm.
LINE 867: "Comet?"
LINE 868: Now that she mentions it, I remember they were talking about something
LINE 869: like that on TV during breakfast, about how the comet's been close enough to
LINE 870: be visible to the naked eye for a few days now and how, just after sunset today,
LINE 871: we'd probably be able to see it if we looked diagonally above Venus.
LINE 872: "The comet..."
LINE 873: I say it aloud one more time. Out of nowhere, I feel as if I've forgotten
LINE 874: something.
LINE 875: I narrow my eyes, searching the western sky, and find what I'm looking for
LINE 876: right away. Above Venus, which is especially bright, I see the comet's shining
LINE 877: blue tail. In the depths of my memory, something's trying to surface.
LINE 878: That's right. Once before, I...
LINE 879: That comet—
LINE 880: ".. .My, my. Mitsuha."
LINE 881: Before I know she's there, Grandma's peering up at me—into me. My
LINE 882: shadow is reflected at the bottom of her deep black eyes.
LINE 883: "You're dreamin', aren't you?"
LINE 884: !
LINE 885: All of a sudden...
LINE 886: I wake up.
LINE 887: I've flung the sheet away, and it falls off the bed without a sound. My
LINE 888: heart's pounding hard enough to raise my ribs (at least I think it is), but I can't
LINE 889: hear my heartbeat. That's weird— But just after the thought forms, little by
LINE 890: little, I start hearing my blood pumping. The morning sparrows outside the
LINE 891: window, car engines, the rumble of trains. As if I'm finally remembering
LINE 892: where I am, my ears begin taking in Tokyo.
LINE 893: "...Tears?"
LINE 894: I touch my cheek and find droplets of water on my fingertips.
LINE 895: Why? I don't know. I wipe my eyes with my palm. Even as I do, the twilight
LINE 896: landscape from a moment ago and the old lady's words are disappearing, like
LINE 897: water soaking into sand.
LINE 898: Tweedle.
LINE 899: By my pillow, my phone chirps.
LINE 900: I'm almost there. I'm looking forward to today, r;
LINE 901: It's a Line message from Okudera-senpai.
LINE 902: Almost here? What's she talking about? .. .And then I gasp.
LINE 903: "Wait, did Mitsuha—? Not again!" Panicked, I dive into my phone and read
LINE 904: Mitsuha's memo. "Adate?!"
LINE 905: I bolt out of bed and get ready at top speed.
LINE 906: Date with Okudera-senpai in Roppongi
LINE 907: tomorrow! She'll be waiting in front of Yotsuya
LINE 908: Station at 10:30. It's a date I want to go on, but
LINE 909: if I'm unlucky and it ends up being you, be
LINE 910: grateful and enjoy it.
LINE 911: Fortunately, the place where we're meeting is nearby. I sprint flat out and
LINE 912: arrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to
LINE 913: make sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend
LINE 914: morning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.
LINE 915: I wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter "Mitsuha,
LINE 916: you idiot" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.
LINE 917: ...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,
LINE 918: this is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,
LINE 919: or an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.
LINE 920: Mitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places
LINE 921: with me!
LINE 922: "Taaaki!"
LINE 923: "Waugh!"
LINE 924: A voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I
LINE 925: turn around.
LINE 926: "Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?"
LINE 927: "No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no..."
LINE 928: What's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,
LINE 929: and if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,
LINE 930: what's the right answer?
LINE 931: "Urn, I, er..."
LINE 932: Flustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.
LINE 933: My eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a
LINE 934: black off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and
LINE 935: legs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed
LINE 936: strategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a
LINE 937: large mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.
LINE 938: She looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.
LINE 939: "...I just got here."
LINE 940: "Oh, good!" she laughs, sounding chipper.
LINE 941: "Shall we?"
LINE 942: She takes my arm... Ah, for a moment—just a moment—your breast
LINE 943: touched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in
LINE 944: this town.
LINE 945: "The conversation keeps dying..."
LINE 946: In the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it
LINE 947: against the mirror.
LINE 948: Three hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever
LINE 949: been in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope
LINE 950: that's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation
LINE 951: unprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too
LINE 952: pretty.
LINE 953: I mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.
LINE 954: Then they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're
LINE 955: thinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,
LINE 956: anyway.
LINE 957: Well, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I
LINE 958: want to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.
LINE 959: Consequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can
LINE 960: tell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely
LINE 961: uncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.
LINE 962: Dammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!
LINE 963: Hoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.
LINE 964: ...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.
LINE 965: And so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked
LINE 966: links, just for you!
LINE 967: "Whoa, seriously?!"
LINE 968: Look at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them
LINE 969: for dear life.
LINE 970: Link 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a
LINE 971: communication disorder
LINE 972: Link 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever
LINE 973: been the tiniest bit popular!
LINE 974: Link 3: \bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on
LINE 975: texts they'll love
LINE 976: .. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.
LINE 977: Walking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.
LINE 978: I'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled
LINE 979: Nostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-
LINE 980: senpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.
LINE 981: Furano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is
LINE 982: divided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't
LINE 983: know the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can
LINE 984: make out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's
LINE 985: summer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem
LINE 986: oddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you
LINE 987: go. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. "Shibuya
LINE 988: and Ikebukuro," for example, or "Akasaka and Kichijouji," or "Meguro and
LINE 989: Tachikawa."
LINE 990: Even so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.
LINE 991: This one is different from the others.
LINE 992: Well, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place—the contours
LINE 993: of the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red
LINE 994: shrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick
LINE 995: out your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I
LINE 996: never actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations
LINE 997: when I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful
LINE 998: sense of deja vu about the place. This is—
LINE 999: "Taki?"
LINE 1000: When I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a
LINE 1001: second, I forgot she existed.
LINE 1002: "You know, Taki," she says with an even smile, "you seem like a different
LINE 1003: person today."
LINE 1004: She executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me
LINE 1005: behind.
LINE 1006: I blew it.
LINE 1007: All I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole
LINE 1008: thing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even
LINE 1009: consider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.
LINE 1010: Even though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I
LINE 1011: should've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've
LINE 1012: spent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.
LINE 1013: From the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi
LINE 1014: buildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.
LINE 1015: My eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.
LINE 1016: Her hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,
LINE 1017: she might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat
LINE 1018: tighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I
LINE 1019: grope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.
LINE 1020: "Um, Okudera-senpai?"
LINE 1021: She doesn't turn.
LINE 1022: ".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere—"
LINE 1023: "Why don't we call it a day instead?" she suggests with the tone of a patient
LINE 1024: teacher.
LINE 1025: "Okay."
LINE 1026: On the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-
LINE 1027: senpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun
LINE 1028: —I can't see it clearly.
LINE 1029: "Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?"
LINE 1030: "Sure."
LINE 1031: "A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?"
LINE 1032: "Huh?!" She knew?! How?!
LINE 1033: "And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?"
LINE 1034: "Huuuuuuuh?!" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical
LINE 1035: rain forest. "N-no, there isn't!"
LINE 1036: "Really?"
LINE 1037: "Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!"
LINE 1038: "I wonder..."
LINE 1039: Okudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,
LINE 1040: there's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long
LINE 1041: hair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost
LINE 1042: immediately.
LINE 1043: "Well, never mind."
LINE 1044: Her tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.
LINE 1045: "Huh?"
LINE 1046: "Thank you for today. I'll see you at work."
LINE 1047: Okudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me
LINE 1048: behind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no
LINE 1049: words come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends
LINE 1050: from the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.
LINE 1051: I gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of
LINE 1052: summer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,
LINE 1053: and after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on
LINE 1054: a real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's
LINE 1055: disappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it
LINE 1056: the entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.
LINE 1057: It feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of
LINE 1058: anything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming
LINE 1059: Mitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,
LINE 1060: we're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound
LINE 1061: together the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think
LINE 1062: I'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.
LINE 1063: "That's why you're not popular, you know. " "It's your fault for promising
LINE 1064: stuff without checking first. "
LINE 1065: I open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.
LINE 1066: The comet should be visible just about the time
LINE 1067: the date ends.
LINE 1068: Eeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.
LINE 1069: V
LINE 1070: Whether it's me or you, let's do our best on the
LINE 1071: date!
LINE 1072: Comet?
LINE 1073: I look up at the sky. The last traces of the sunset are already gone. A few of
LINE 1074: the brightest stars are out, and a jet's flying past, humming faintly, but that's it.
LINE 1075: Needless to say, there's no comet.
LINE 1076: "What's she talking about?" I mutter quietly.
LINE 1077: If a comet people could actually see was passing, it would've been pretty
LINE 1078: big news. Maybe Mitsuha got mixed up.
LINE 1079: Abruptly, my heart twinges uneasily in its darkest recesses.
LINE 1080: Something's trying to surface in my mind.
LINE 1081: I flip through the phone and pull up Mitsuha's cell number, staring at those
LINE 1082: eleven digits. Back when we first started swapping, I tried calling this number
LINE 1083: several times, but for some reason, it never went through. I touch it with a
LINE 1084: fingertip. The "calling" sound plays. Then I hear a voice from the speaker:
LINE 1085: "The number you have dialed is unavailable. Either the number is not in
LINE 1086: service or the unit is turned off or out of range... "
LINE 1087: I pull the phone away from my ear and press end call.
LINE 1088: So calls really don't get through. Well, whatever. I'll just tell her about this
LINE 1089: train wreck of a day next time we swap. I'll ask her about the comet, too. We'll
LINE 1090: switch tomorrow or the day after, anyway. With that thought, I finally descend
LINE 1091: the pedestrian bridge. There's a pale, smooth half-moon overhead, all alone, as
LINE 1092: if someone forgot it there.
LINE 1093: But after that, Mitsuha and I never swapped again.
