LINE 1: Chia Yuan-ch'un is, on account of her talents, selected to enter the
LINE 2: Feng Ts'ao Palace.
LINE 3: Ch'in Ching-ch'ing departs, in the prime of life, by the yellow spring
LINE 4: road.
LINE 5: But we must now return to the two lads, Ch'in Chung and Pao-yü. After
LINE 6: they had passed, along with lady Feng from the Temple of the Iron Fence,
LINE 7: whither she had gone to see how things were getting on, they entered the
LINE 8: city in their carriages. On their arrival at home, they paid their
LINE 9: obeisance to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the other members of the
LINE 10: family, whence they returned to their own quarters, where nothing worth
LINE 11: mentioning transpired during the night.
LINE 12: On the next day, Pao-yü perceiving that the repairs to the outer
LINE 13: schoolroom had been completed, settled with Ch'in Chung that they should
LINE 14: have evening classes. But as it happened that Ch'in Chung, who was
LINE 15: naturally of an extremely delicate physique, caught somewhat of a chill
LINE 16: in the country and clandestinely indulged, besides, in an intimacy with
LINE 17: Chih Neng, which unavoidably made him fail to take good care of himself,
LINE 18: he was, shortly after his return, troubled with a cough and a feverish
LINE 19: cold, with nausea for drink and food, and fell into such an extremely
LINE 20: poor state of health that he simply kept indoors and nursed himself, and
LINE 21: was not in a fit condition to go to school. Pao-yü's spirits were
LINE 22: readily damped, but as there was likewise no remedy he had no other
LINE 23: course than to wait until his complete recovery, before he could make
LINE 24: any arrangements.
LINE 25: Lady Feng had meanwhile received a reply from Yün Kuang, in which he
LINE 26: informed her that everything had been satisfactorily settled, and the
LINE 27: old nun apprised the Chang family that the major had actually suppressed
LINE 28: his indignation, hushed his complaints, and taken back the presents of
LINE 29: the previous engagement. But who would have ever anticipated that a
LINE 30: father and mother, whose hearts were set upon position and their
LINE 31: ambition upon wealth, could have brought up a daughter so conscious of
LINE 32: propriety and so full of feeling as to seize the first opportunity,
LINE 33: after she had heard that she had been withdrawn from her former
LINE 34: intended, and been promised to the Li family, to stealthily devise a way
LINE 35: to commit suicide, by means of a handkerchief. The son of the Major,
LINE 36: upon learning that Chin Ko had strangled herself, there and then jumped
LINE 37: into the river and drowned himself, as he too was a being full of love.
LINE 38: The Chang and Li families were, sad to relate, very much cut up, and, in
LINE 39: very truth, two lives and money had been sacrificed all to no use.
LINE 40: Lady Feng, however, during this while, quietly enjoyed the three
LINE 41: thousand taels, and madame Wang did not have even so much as the
LINE 42: faintest idea of the whole matter. But ever since this occasion, lady
LINE 43: Feng's audacity acquired more and more strength; and the actions of this
LINE 44: kind, which she, in after days, performed, defy enumeration.
LINE 45: One day, the very day on which Chia Cheng's birthday fell, while the
LINE 46: members of the two households of Ning and Jung were assembled together
LINE 47: offering their congratulations, and unusual bustle and stir prevailed, a
LINE 48: gatekeeper came in, at quite an unexpected moment, to announce that Mr.
LINE 49: Hsia, Metropolitan Head Eunuch of the six palaces, had come with the
LINE 50: special purpose of presenting an edict from his Majesty; a bit of news
LINE 51: which plunged Chia She, Chia Cheng and the whole company into great
LINE 52: consternation, as they could not make out what was up. Speedily
LINE 53: interrupting the theatrical performance, they had the banquet cleared,
LINE 54: and the altar laid out with incense, and opening the centre gate they
LINE 55: fell on their knees to receive the edict.
LINE 56: Soon they caught sight of the head eunuch, Hsia Ping-chung, advancing on
LINE 57: horseback, and besides himself, a considerable retinue of eunuchs. The
LINE 58: eunuch Hsia did not, in fact, carry any mandate or present any decree;
LINE 59: but straightway advancing as far as the main hall, he dismounted, and,
LINE 60: with a face beaming with smiles, he walked into the Hall and took his
LINE 61: stand on the southern side.
LINE 62: "I have had the honour," he said, "of receiving a special order to at
LINE 63: once summon Chia Cheng to present himself at Court and be admitted in
LINE 64: His Majesty's presence in the Lin Ching Hall."
LINE 65: When he had delivered this message, he did not so much as take any tea,
LINE 66: but forthwith mounted his horse and took his leave.
LINE 67: Chia Cheng and the others could not even conceive what omen this summons
LINE 68: implied, but he had no alternative but to change his clothes with all
LINE 69: haste and to present himself at Court, while dowager lady Chia and the
LINE 70: inmates of the whole household were, in their hearts, a prey to such
LINE 71: perplexity and uncertainty that they incessantly despatched messengers
LINE 72: on flying steeds to go and bring the news.
LINE 73: After the expiry of four hours, they suddenly perceived Lai Ta and three
LINE 74: or four other butlers run in, quite out of breath, through the
LINE 75: ceremonial gate and report the glad tidings. "We have received," they
LINE 76: added, "our master's commands, to hurriedly request her venerable
LINE 77: ladyship to take madame Wang and the other ladies into the Palace, to
LINE 78: return thanks for His Majesty's bounty;" and other words to the same
LINE 79: purport.
LINE 80: Dowager lady Chia was, at this time, standing, with agitated heart,
LINE 81: under the verandah of the Large Hall waiting for tidings, whilst the two
LINE 82: ladies, mesdames Hsing and Wang, Mrs. Yu, Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying Ch'un
LINE 83: and her sisters, even up to Mrs. Hsüeh and the rest, were congregated in
LINE 84: one place ascertaining what was the news. Old lady Chia likewise called
LINE 85: Lai Ta in and minutely questioned him as to what had happened. "Your
LINE 86: servants," replied Lai Ta, "simply stood waiting outside the Lin Chuang
LINE 87: gate, so that we were in total ignorance of what was going on inside,
LINE 88: when presently the Eunuch Hsia came out and imparted to us the glad
LINE 89: tidings; telling us that the eldest of the young ladies in our household
LINE 90: had been raised, by His Majesty, to be an overseer in the Feng Ts'ao
LINE 91: Palace, and that he had, in addition, conferred upon her the rank of
LINE 92: worthy and virtuous secondary consort. By and by, Mr. Chia Cheng came
LINE 93: out and also told us the same thing. Master is now gone back again to
LINE 94: the Eastern Palace, whither he requests your venerable ladyship to go at
LINE 95: once and offer thanks for the Imperial favour."
LINE 96: When old lady Chia and the other members of the family heard these
LINE 97: tidings they were at length reassured in their minds, and so elated were
LINE 98: they all in one moment that joy was visible in their very faces. Without
LINE 99: loss of time, they commenced to don the gala dresses suitable to their
LINE 100: rank; which done, old lady Chia led the way for the two ladies, mesdames
LINE 101: Hsing and Wang, as well as for Mrs. Yu; and their official chairs, four
LINE 102: of them in all, entered the palace like a trail of fish; while Chia She
LINE 103: and Chia Chen, who had likewise changed their clothes for their court
LINE 104: dress, took Chia Se and Chia Jung along and proceeded in attendance upon
LINE 105: dowager lady Chia.
LINE 106: Indeed, of the two households of Ning and Jung, there was not one,
LINE 107: whether high or low, woman or man, who was not in a high state of
LINE 108: exultation, with the exception of Pao-yü, who behaved just as if the
LINE 109: news had not reached his ears; and can you, reader, guess why? The fact
LINE 110: is that Chih Neng, of the Water Moon Convent, had recently entered the
LINE 111: city in a surreptitious manner in search of Ch'in Chung; but, contrary
LINE 112: to expectation, her visit came to be known by Ch'in Yeh, who drove Chih
LINE 113: Neng away and laid hold of Ch'in Chung and gave him a flogging. But this
LINE 114: outburst of temper of his brought about a relapse of his old complaint,
LINE 115: with the result that in three or five days, he, sad to say, succumbed.
LINE 116: Ch'in Chung had himself ever been in a delicate state of health and had
LINE 117: besides received a caning before he had got over his sickness, so that
LINE 118: when he now saw his aged father pass away from the consequences of a fit
LINE 119: of anger, he felt, at this stage, so full of penitence and distress that
LINE 120: the symptoms of his illness were again considerably aggravated. Hence it
LINE 121: was that Pao-yü was downcast and unhappy at heart, and that nothing
LINE 122: could, in spite of the promotion of Yuan Ch'un by imperial favour,
LINE 123: dispel the depression of his spirits.
LINE 124: Dowager lady Chia and the rest in due course offered thanks and returned
LINE 125: home, the relatives and friends came to present their congratulations,
LINE 126: great stir and excitement prevailed during these few days in the two
LINE 127: mansions of Ning and Jung, and every one was in high glee; but he alone
LINE 128: looked upon everything as if it were nothing; taking not the least
LINE 129: interest in anything; and as this reason led the whole family to sneer
LINE 130: at him, the result was that he got more and more doltish.
LINE 131: Luckily, however, Chia Lien and Tai-yü were on their way back, and had
LINE 132: despatched messengers, in advance, to announce the news that they would
LINE 133: be able to reach home the following day, so that when Pao-yü heard the
LINE 134: tidings, he was at length somewhat cheered. And when he came to
LINE 135: institute minute inquiries, he eventually found out: "that Chia Yü-ts'un
LINE 136: was also coming to the capital to have an audience with His Majesty,
LINE 137: that it was entirely because Wang Tzu-t'eng had repeatedly laid before
LINE 138: the Throne memorials recommending him that he was coming on this
LINE 139: occasion to wait in the metropolis for a vacancy which he could fill up;
LINE 140: that as he was a kinsman of Chia Lien's, acknowledging the same
LINE 141: ancestors as he did, and he stood, on the other hand, with Tai-yü, in
LINE 142: the relationship of tutor and pupil, he was in consequence following the
LINE 143: same road and coming as their companion; that Lin Ju-hai had already
LINE 144: been buried in the ancestral vault, and that every requirement had been
LINE 145: attended to with propriety; that Chia Lien, on this voyage to the
LINE 146: capital, would, had he progressed by the ordinary stages, have been over
LINE 147: a month before he could reach home, but that when he came to hear the
LINE 148: good news about Yuan Ch'un, he pressed on day and night to enter the
LINE 149: capital; and that the whole journey had been throughout, in every
LINE 150: respect, both pleasant and propitious."
LINE 151: But Pao-yü merely ascertained whether Tai-yü was all right, and did not
LINE 152: even so much as trouble his mind with the rest of what he heard; and he
LINE 153: remained on the tiptoe of expectation, till noon of the morrow; when, in
LINE 154: point of fact, it was announced that Mr. Lien, together with Miss Lin,
LINE 155: had made their entrance into the mansion. When they came face to face,
LINE 156: grief and joy vied with each other; and they could not help having a
LINE 157: good cry for a while; after which followed again expressions of sympathy
LINE 158: and congratulations; while Pao-yü pondered within himself that Tai-yü
LINE 159: had become still more surpassingly handsome.
LINE 160: Tai-yü had also brought along with her a good number of books, and she
LINE 161: promptly gave orders that the sleeping rooms should be swept, and that
LINE 162: the various nicknacks should be put in their proper places. She further
LINE 163: produced a certain quantity of paper, pencils and other such things, and
LINE 164: distributed them among Pao Ch'ai, Ying Ch'un, Pao-yü and the rest; and
LINE 165: Pao-yü also brought out, with extreme care, the string of Ling-ling
LINE 166: scented beads, which had been given to him by the Prince of Pei Ching,
LINE 167: and handed them, in his turn, to Tai-yü as a present.
LINE 168: "What foul man has taken hold of them?" exclaimed Tai-yü. "I don't want
LINE 169: any such things;" and as she forthwith dashed them down, and would not
LINE 170: accept them, Pao-yü was under the necessity of taking them back. But for
LINE 171: the time being we will not allude to them, but devote our attention to
LINE 172: Chia Lien.
LINE 173: Having, after his arrival home, paid his salutations to all the inmates,
LINE 174: he retired to his own quarters at the very moment that lady Feng had
LINE 175: multifarious duties to attend to, and had not even a minute to spare;
LINE 176: but, considering that Chia Lien had returned from a distant journey, she
LINE 177: could not do otherwise than put by what she had to do, and to greet him
LINE 178: and wait on him.
LINE 179: "Imperial uncle," she said, in a jocose manner, when she realised that
LINE 180: there was no outsider present in the room, "I congratulate you! What
LINE 181: fatigue and hardship you, Imperial uncle, have had to bear throughout
LINE 182: the whole journey, your humble servant heard yesterday, when the courier
LINE 183: sent ahead came and announced that Your Highness would this day reach
LINE 184: this mansion. I have merely got ready a glass of mean wine for you to
LINE 185: wipe down the dust with, but I wonder, whether Your Highness will deign
LINE 186: to bestow upon it the lustre of your countenance, and accept it."
LINE 187: Chia Lien smiled. "How dare I presume to such an honour," he added by
LINE 188: way of rejoinder; "I'm unworthy of such attention! Many thanks, many
LINE 189: thanks."
LINE 190: P'ing Erh and the whole company of waiting-maids simultaneously paid
LINE 191: their obeisance to him, and this ceremony concluded, they presented tea.
LINE 192: Chia Lien thereupon made inquiries about the various matters, which had
LINE 193: transpired in their home after his departure, and went on to thank lady
LINE 194: Feng for all the trouble she had taken in the management of them.
LINE 195: "How could I control all these manifold matters," remarked lady Feng;
LINE 196: "my experience is so shallow, my speech so dull and my mind so simple,
LINE 197: that if any one showed me a club, I would mistake it for a pin. Besides,
LINE 198: I'm so tender-hearted that were any one to utter a couple of glib
LINE 199: remarks, I couldn't help feeling my heart give way to compassion and
LINE 200: sympathy. I've had, in addition, no experience in any weighty questions;
LINE 201: my pluck is likewise so very small that when madame Wang has felt in the
LINE 202: least displeased, I have not been able to close my eyes and sleep.
LINE 203: Urgently did I more than once resign the charge, but her ladyship
LINE 204: wouldn't again agree to it; maintaining, on the contrary, that my object
LINE 205: was to be at ease, and that I was not willing to reap experience.
LINE 206: Leaving aside that she doesn't know that I take things so much to heart,
LINE 207: that I can scoop the perspiration in handfuls, that I daren't utter one
LINE 208: word more than is proper, nor venture to recklessly take one step more
LINE 209: than I ought to, you know very well which of the women servants, in
LINE 210: charge of the menage in our household, is easy to manage! If ever I make
LINE 211: the slightest mistake, they laugh at me and poke fun at me; and if I
LINE 212: incline a little one way, they show their displeasure by innuendoes;
LINE 213: they sit by and look on, they use every means to do harm, they stir up
LINE 214: trouble, they stand by on safe ground and look on and don't give a
LINE 215: helping hand to lift any one they have thrown over, and they are, one
LINE 216: and all of them, old hands in such tricks. I'm moreover young in years
LINE 217: and not able to keep people in check, so that they naturally don't show
LINE 218: any regard for me! What is still more ridiculous is that after the death
LINE 219: of Jung Erh's wife in that mansion, brother Chen, time and again, begged
LINE 220: madame Wang, on his very knees, to do him the favour to ask me to lend
LINE 221: him a hand for several days. I repeatedly signified my refusal, but her
LINE 222: ladyship gave her consent in order to oblige him, so that I had no help
LINE 223: but to carry out her wish; putting, as is my wont, everything
LINE 224: topsy-turvey, and making matters worse than they were; with the result
LINE 225: that brother Chen up to this day bears me a grudge and regrets having
LINE 226: asked for my assistance. When you see him to-morrow, do what you can to
LINE 227: excuse me by him. 'Young as she is,' tell him, 'and without experience
LINE 228: of the world, who ever could have instigated Mr. Chia Cheng to make such
LINE 229: a mistake as to choose her.'"
LINE 230: While they were still chatting, they heard people talking in the outer
LINE 231: apartments, and lady Feng speedily inquired who it was. P'ing Erh
LINE 232: entered the room to reply. "Lady Hsüeh," she said, "has sent sister
LINE 233: Hsiang Ling over to ask me something; but I've already given her my
LINE 234: answer and sent her back."
LINE 235: "Quite so," interposed Chia Lien with a smile. "A short while ago I went
LINE 236: to look up Mrs. Hsüeh and came face to face with a young girl, whose
LINE 237: features were supremely perfect, and as I suspected that, in our
LINE 238: household, there was no such person, I asked in the course of
LINE 239: conversation, Mrs. Hsüeh about her, and found out eventually that this
LINE 240: was the young waiting-maid they had purchased on their way to the
LINE 241: capital, Hsiang Ling by name, and that she had after all become an
LINE 242: inmate of the household of that big fool Hsüeh. Since she's had her hair
LINE 243: dressed as a married woman she does look so much more pre-eminently
LINE 244: beautiful! But that big fool Hsüeh has really brought contamination upon
LINE 245: her."
LINE 246: "Ai!" exclaimed lady Feng, "here you are back from a trip to Suchow and
LINE 247: Hang Chow, where you should have seen something of the world! and have
LINE 248: you still an eye as envious and a heart so covetous? Well, if you wish
LINE 249: to bestow your love on her, there's no difficulty worth speaking of.
LINE 250: I'll take P'ing Erh over and exchange her for her; what do you say to
LINE 251: that? that old brother Hsüeh is also one of those men, who, while eating
LINE 252: what there is in the bowl, keeps an eye on what there is in the pan! For
LINE 253: the last year or so, as he couldn't get Hsiang Ling to be his, he made
LINE 254: ever so many distressing appeals to Mrs. Hsüeh; and Mrs. Hsüeh while
LINE 255: esteeming Hsiang Ling's looks, though fine, as after all a small matter,
LINE 256: (thought) her deportment and conduct so far unlike those of other girls,
LINE 257: so gentle and so demure that almost the very daughters of masters and
LINE 258: mistresses couldn't attain her standard, that she therefore went to the
LINE 259: trouble of spreading a banquet, and of inviting guests, and in open
LINE 260: court, and in the legitimate course, she gave her to him for a secondary
LINE 261: wife. But half a month had scarcely elapsed before he looked upon her
LINE 262: also as a good-for-nothing person as he did upon a large number of them!
LINE 263: I can't however help feeling pity for her in my heart."
LINE 264: Scarcely had she time to conclude what she had to say when a youth, on
LINE 265: duty at the second gate, transmitted the announcement that Mr. Chia
LINE 266: Cheng was in the Library waiting for Mr. Secundus. At these words, Chia
LINE 267: Lien speedily adjusted his clothes, and left the apartment; and during
LINE 268: his absence, lady Feng inquired of P'ing Erh what Mrs. Hsüeh wanted a
LINE 269: few minutes back, that she sent Hsiang Ling round in such a hurry.
LINE 270: "What Hsiang Ling ever came?" replied P'ing Erh. "I simply made use of
LINE 271: her name to tell a lie for the occasion. Tell me, my lady, (what's come
LINE 272: to) Wang Erh's wife? why she's got so bad that there's even no common
LINE 273: sense left in her!" Saying this she again drew near lady Feng's side,
LINE 274: and in a soft tone of voice, she continued: "That interest of yours, my
LINE 275: lady, she doesn't send later, nor does she send it sooner; but she must
LINE 276: send it round the very moment when master Secundus is at home! But as
LINE 277: luck would have it, I was in the hall, so that I came across her;
LINE 278: otherwise, she would have walked in and told your ladyship, and Mr.
LINE 279: Secundus would naturally have come to know about it! And our master
LINE 280: would, with that frame of mind of his, have fished it out and spent it,
LINE 281: had the money even been at the bottom of a pan full of oil! and were he
LINE 282: to have heard that my lady had private means, would he not have been
LINE 283: still more reckless in spending? Hence it was that, losing no time in
LINE 284: taking the money over, I had to tell her a few words which, who would
LINE 285: have thought, happened to be overheard by your ladyship; that's why, in
LINE 286: the presence of master Secundus, I simply explained that Hsiang Ling had
LINE 287: come!"
LINE 288: These words evoked a smile from lady Feng. "Mrs. Hsueh, I thought to
LINE 289: myself," she observed, "knows very well that your Mr. Secundus has come,
LINE 290: and yet, regardless of propriety, she, instead (of keeping her at home),
LINE 291: sends some one over from her inner rooms! and it was you after all, you
LINE 292: vixen, playing these pranks!"
LINE 293: As she uttered this remark, Chia Lien walked in, and lady Feng issued
LINE 294: orders to serve the wine and the eatables, and husband and wife took
LINE 295: their seats opposite to each other; but notwithstanding that lady Feng
LINE 296: was very partial to drink, she nevertheless did not have the courage to
LINE 297: indulge her weakness, but merely partook of some to keep him company.
LINE 298: Chia Lien's nurse, dame Chao, entered the room, and Chia Lien and lady
LINE 299: Feng promptly pressed her to have a glass of wine, and bade her sit on
LINE 300: the stove-couch, but dame Chao was obstinate in her refusal. P'ing Erh
LINE 301: and the other waiting-maids had at an early hour placed a square stool
LINE 302: next to the edge of the couch, where was likewise a small footstool, and
LINE 303: on this footstool dame Chao took a seat, whereupon Chia Lien chose two
LINE 304: dishes of delicacies from the table, which he handed her to place on the
LINE 305: square stool for her own use.
LINE 306: "Dame Chao," lady Feng remarked, "couldn't very well bite through that,
LINE 307: for mind it might make her teeth drop! This morning," she therefore
LINE 308: asked of P'ing Erh, "I suggested that that shoulder of pork stewed with
LINE 309: ham was so tender as to be quite the thing to be given to dame Chao to
LINE 310: eat; and how is it you haven't taken it over to her? But go at once and
LINE 311: tell them to warm it and bring it in! Dame Chao," she went on, "just you
LINE 312: taste this Hui Ch'üan wine brought by your foster-son."
LINE 313: "I'll drink it," replied dame Chao, "but you, my lady, must also have a
LINE 314: cup: what's there to fear? the one thing to guard against is any excess,
LINE 315: that's all! But I've now come over, not for any wine or eatables; on the
LINE 316: contrary, there's a serious matter, which I would ask your ladyship to
LINE 317: impress on your mind, and to show me some regard, for this master of
LINE 318: ours is only good to utter fine words, but when the time (to act) does
LINE 319: come, he forgets all about us! As I have had the good fortune to nurse
LINE 320: him in his infancy and to bring him up to this age, 'I too have grown
LINE 321: old in years,' I said to him, 'and all that belong to me are those two
LINE 322: sons, and do look upon them with some particular favour!' With any one
LINE 323: else I shouldn't have ventured to open my mouth, but him I anyway
LINE 324: entreated time and again on several occasions. His assent was of course
LINE 325: well and good, but up to this very moment he still withholds his help.
LINE 326: Now besides from the heavens has dropped such a mighty piece of good
LINE 327: luck; and in what place will there be no need of servants? that's why I
LINE 328: come to tell you, my lady, as is but right, for were I to depend upon
LINE 329: our master, I fear I shall even die of starvation."
LINE 330: Lady Feng laughed. "You'd better," she suggested, "put those two elder
LINE 331: foster brothers of his both under my charge! But you've nursed that
LINE 332: foster-son from his babyhood, and don't you yet know that disposition of
LINE 333: his, how that he takes his skin and flesh and sticks it, (not on the
LINE 334: body of a relative), but, on the contrary, on that of an outsider and
LINE 335: stranger? (to Chia Lien.) Which of those foster brothers whom you have
LINE 336: now discarded, isn't clearly better than others? and were you to have
LINE 337: shown them some favour and consideration, who would have ventured to
LINE 338: have said 'don't?' Instead of that, you confer benefits upon thorough
LINE 339: strangers, and all to no purpose whatever! But these words of mine are
LINE 340: also incorrect, eh? for those whom we regard as strangers you,
LINE 341: contrariwise, will treat just as if they were relatives!"
LINE 342: At these words every one present in the room burst out laughing; even
LINE 343: nurse Chao could not repress herself; and as she invoked Buddha,--"In
LINE 344: very truth," she exclaimed, "in this room has sprung up a kind-hearted
LINE 345: person! as regards relatives and strangers, such foolish distinctions
LINE 346: aren't drawn by our master; and it's simply because he's full of pity
LINE 347: and is tenderhearted that he can't put off any one who gives vent to a
LINE 348: few words of entreaty, and nothing else!"
LINE 349: "That's quite it!" rejoined lady Feng smiling sarcastically, "to those
LINE 350: whom he looks upon as relatives, he's kindhearted, but with me and his
LINE 351: mother he's as hard as steel."
LINE 352: "What you say, my lady, is very considerate," remarked nurse Chao, "and
LINE 353: I'm really so full of delight that I'll have another glass of good wine!
LINE 354: and, if from this time forward, your ladyship will act as you think
LINE 355: best, I'll have then nothing to be sorry for!"
LINE 356: Chia Lien did not at this juncture feel quite at his ease, but he could
LINE 357: do no more than feign a smile. "You people," he said, "should leave off
LINE 358: talking nonsense, and bring the eatables at once and let us have our
LINE 359: meal, as I have still to go on the other side and see Mr. Chia Chen, to
LINE 360: consult with him about business."
LINE 361: "To be sure you have," ventured lady Feng, "and you shouldn't neglect
LINE 362: your legitimate affairs; but what did Mr. Chia Chen tell you when he
LINE 363: sent for you just a while back?"
LINE 364: "It was about the visit (of Yuan Ch'un) to her parents," Chia Lien
LINE 365: explained.
LINE 366: "Has after all permission for the visit been granted?" lady Feng
LINE 367: inquired with alacrity.
LINE 368: "Though not quite granted," Chia Lien replied joyously, "it's
LINE 369: nevertheless more or less an accomplished fact."
LINE 370: "This is indeed evidence of the great bounty of the present Emperor!"
LINE 371: lady Feng observed smirkingly; "one doesn't hear in books, or see in
LINE 372: plays, written from time to time, any mention of such an instance, even
LINE 373: so far back as the days of old!"
LINE 374: Dame Chao took up again the thread of the conversation. "Indeed it's
LINE 375: so!" she interposed; "But I'm in very truth quite stupid from old age,
LINE 376: for I've heard every one, high and low, clamouring during these few
LINE 377: days, something or other about 'Hsing Ch'in' or no 'Hsing Ch'in,' but I
LINE 378: didn't really pay any heed to it; and now again, here's something more
LINE 379: about this 'Hsing Ch'in,' but what's it all about, I wonder?"
LINE 380: "The Emperor at present on the Throne," explained Chia Lien, "takes into
LINE 381: consideration the feelings of his people. In the whole world, there is
LINE 382: (in his opinion), no more essential thing than filial piety; maintaining
LINE 383: that the feelings of father, mother, son and daughter are
LINE 384: indiscriminately subject to one principle, without any distinction
LINE 385: between honorable and mean. The present Emperor himself day and night
LINE 386: waits upon their majesties his Father and the Empress Dowager, and yet
LINE 387: cannot, in the least degree, carry out to the full his ideal of filial
LINE 388: piety. The secondary consorts, meritorious persons and other inmates of
LINE 389: the Palace, he remembered, had entered within its precincts many years
LINE 390: back, casting aside fathers and mothers, so how could they not help
LINE 391: thinking of them? Besides, the fathers and mothers, who remain at home
LINE 392: must long for their daughters, of whom they cannot get even so much as a
LINE 393: glimpse, and if, through this solicitude, they were to contract any
LINE 394: illness, the harmony of heaven would also be seriously impaired, so for
LINE 395: this reason, he memorialised the Emperor, his father, and the Empress
LINE 396: Dowager that every month, on the recurrence of the second and sixth
LINE 397: days, permission should be accorded to the relatives of the imperial
LINE 398: consorts to enter the palace and make application to see their
LINE 399: daughters. The Emperor, his father, and Empress Dowager were, forthwith,
LINE 400: much delighted by this representation, and eulogised, in high terms, the
LINE 401: piety and generosity of the present Emperor, his regard for the will of
LINE 402: heaven and his research into the nature of things. Both their sacred
LINE 403: Majesties consequently also issued a decree to the effect: that the
LINE 404: entrance of the relatives of the imperial consorts into the Palace could
LINE 405: not but interfere with the dignity of the state, and the rules of
LINE 406: conventional rites, but that as the mothers and daughters could not
LINE 407: gratify the wishes of their hearts, Their Majesties would, after all,
LINE 408: show a high proof of expedient grace, and issue a special command that:
LINE 409: 'exclusive of the generous bounty, by virtue of which the worthy
LINE 410: relations of the imperial consorts could enter the palace on the second
LINE 411: and sixth days, any family, having extensive accommodation and separate
LINE 412: courts suitable for the cantonment of the imperial body-guard, could,
LINE 413: without any detriment, make application to the Inner Palace, for the
LINE 414: entrance of the imperial chair into the private residences, to the end
LINE 415: that the personal feelings of relations might be gratified, and that
LINE 416: they should collectively enjoy the bliss of a family reunion.' After the
LINE 417: issue of this decree, who did not leap from grateful joy! The father of
LINE 418: the honourable secondary consort Chou has now already initiated works,
LINE 419: in his residence, for the repairs to the separate courts necessary for
LINE 420: the visiting party. Wu T'ien-yu too, the father of Wu, the distinguished
LINE 421: consort, has likewise gone outside the city walls in search of a
LINE 422: suitable plot of ground; and don't these amount to well-nigh
LINE 423: accomplished facts?"
LINE 424: "O-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed dame Chao. "Is it really so? but from what you
LINE 425: say, our family will also be making preparations for the reception of
LINE 426: the eldest young lady!"
LINE 427: "That goes without saying," added Chia Lien, "otherwise, for what
LINE 428: purpose could we be in such a stir just now?"
LINE 429: "It's of course so!" interposed lady Feng smiling, "and I shall now have
LINE 430: an opportunity of seeing something great of the world. My misfortune is
LINE 431: that I'm young by several years; for had I been born twenty or thirty
LINE 432: years sooner, all these old people wouldn't really be now treating me
LINE 433: contemptuously for not having seen the world! To begin with, the Emperor
LINE 434: Tai Tsu, in years gone by, imitated the old policy of Shun, and went on
LINE 435: a tour, giving rise to more stir than any book could have ever produced;
LINE 436: but I happen to be devoid of that good fortune which could have enabled
LINE 437: me to come in time."
LINE 438: "Ai ya, ya!" ejaculated dame Chao, "such a thing is rarely met with in a
LINE 439: thousand years! I was old enough at that time to remember the
LINE 440: occurrence! Our Chia family was then at Ku Su, Yangchow and all along
LINE 441: that line, superintending the construction of ocean vessels, and the
LINE 442: repairs to the seaboard. This was the only time in which preparations
LINE 443: were made for the reception of the Emperor, and money was lavished in
LINE 444: quantities as great as the billowing waters of the sea!"
LINE 445: This subject once introduced, lady Feng took up the thread of the
LINE 446: conversation with vehemence. "Our Wang family," she said, "did also make
LINE 447: preparations on one occasion. At that time my grandfather was in sole
LINE 448: charge of all matters connected with tribute from various states, as
LINE 449: well as with general levées, so that whenever any foreigners arrived,
LINE 450: they all came to our house to be entertained, while the whole of the
LINE 451: goods, brought by foreign vessels from the two Kuang provinces, from
LINE 452: Fukien, Yunnan and Chekiang, were the property of our family."
LINE 453: "Who isn't aware of these facts?" ventured dame Chao; "there is up to
LINE 454: this day a saying that, 'in the eastern sea, there was a white jade bed
LINE 455: required, and the dragon prince came to request Mr. Wang of Chin Ling
LINE 456: (to give it to him)!' This saying relates to your family, my lady, and
LINE 457: remains even now in vogue. The Chen family of Chiang Nan has recently
LINE 458: held, oh such a fine old standing! it alone has entertained the Emperor
LINE 459: on four occasions! Had we not seen these things with our own eyes, were
LINE 460: we to tell no matter whom, they wouldn't surely ever believe them! Not
LINE 461: to speak of the money, which was as plentiful as mud, all things,
LINE 462: whether they were to be found in the world or not, were they not heaped
LINE 463: up like hills, and collected like the waters of the sea? But with the
LINE 464: four characters representing sin and pity they didn't however trouble
LINE 465: their minds."
LINE 466: "I've often heard," continued lady Feng, "my eldest uncle say that
LINE 467: things were in such a state, and how couldn't I believe? but what
LINE 468: surprises me is how it ever happened that this family attained such
LINE 469: opulence and honour!"
LINE 470: "I'll tell your ladyship and all in one sentence," replied nurse Chao.
LINE 471: "Why they simply took the Emperor's money and spent it for the Emperor's
LINE 472: person, that's all! for what family has such a lot of money as to
LINE 473: indulge in this useless extravagance?"
LINE 474: While they were engaged in this conversation, a servant came a second
LINE 475: time, at the instance of madame Wang, to see whether lady Feng had
LINE 476: finished her meal or not; and lady Feng forthwith concluding that there
LINE 477: must be something waiting for her to attend to, hurriedly rushed through
LINE 478: her repast. She had just rinsed her mouth and was about to start when
LINE 479: the youths, on duty at the second gate, also reported that the two
LINE 480: gentlemen, Mr. Chia Jung and Mr. Chia Se, belonging to the Eastern
LINE 481: mansion, had arrived.
LINE 482: Chia Lien had, at length, rinsed his mouth; but while P'ing Erh
LINE 483: presented a basin for him to wash his hands, he perceived the two young
LINE 484: men walk in, and readily inquired of them what they had to say.
LINE 485: Lady Feng was, on account (of their arrival), likewise compelled to
LINE 486: stay, and she heard Chia Jung take the lead and observe: "My father has
LINE 487: sent me to tell you, uncle, that the gentlemen, have already decided
LINE 488: that the whole extent of ground, starting from the East side, borrowing
LINE 489: (for the occasion) the flower garden of the Eastern mansion, straight up
LINE 490: to the North West, had been measured and found to amount in all to three
LINE 491: and a half li; that it will be suitable for the erection of extra
LINE 492: accommodation for the visiting party; that they have already
LINE 493: commissioned an architect to draw a plan, which will be ready by
LINE 494: to-morrow; that as you, uncle, have just returned home, and must
LINE 495: unavoidably feel fatigued, you need not go over to our house, but that
LINE 496: if you have anything to say you should please come tomorrow morning, as
LINE 497: early as you can, and consult verbally with him."
LINE 498: "Thank uncle warmly," Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, "for the trouble he
LINE 499: has taken in thinking of me; I shall, in that case, comply with his
LINE 500: wishes and not go over. This plan is certainly the proper one, for while
LINE 501: trouble will thus be saved, the erection of the quarters will likewise
LINE 502: be an easy matter; for had a distinct plot to be selected and to be
LINE 503: purchased, it would involve far greater difficulties. What's more,
LINE 504: things wouldn't, after all, be what they properly should be. When you
LINE 505: get back, tell your father that this decision is the right one, and that
LINE 506: should the gentlemen have any further wish to introduce any change in
LINE 507: their proposals, it will rest entirely with my uncle to prevent them, as
LINE 508: it's on no account advisable to go and cast one's choice on some other
LINE 509: plot; that to-morrow as soon as it's daylight, I'll come and pay my
LINE 510: respects to uncle, when we can enter into further details in our
LINE 511: deliberations!"
LINE 512: Chia Jung hastily signified his assent by several yes's, and Chia Se
LINE 513: also came forward to deliver his message. "The mission to Ku Su," he
LINE 514: explained, "to find tutors, to purchase servant girls, and to obtain
LINE 515: musical instruments, and theatrical properties and the like, my uncle
LINE 516: has confided to me; and as I'm to take along with me the two sons of a
LINE 517: couple of majordomos, and two companions of the family, besides, Tan
LINE 518: P'ing-jen and Pei Ku-hsiu, he has, for this reason, enjoined me to come
LINE 519: and see you, uncle."
LINE 520: Upon hearing this, Chia Lien scrutinised Chia Se. "What!" he asked, "are
LINE 521: you able to undertake these commissions? These matters are, it's true,
LINE 522: of no great moment; but there's something more hidden in them!"
LINE 523: Chia Se smiled. "The best thing I can do," he remarked, "will be to
LINE 524: execute them in my novice sort of way, that's all."
LINE 525: Chia Jung was standing next to lady Feng, out of the light of the lamp,
LINE 526: and stealthily pulled the lapel of her dress. Lady Feng understood the
LINE 527: hint, and putting on a smiling expression, "You are too full of fears!"
LINE 528: she interposed. "Is it likely that our uncle Chen doesn't, after all,
LINE 529: know better than we do what men to employ, that you again give way to
LINE 530: apprehensions that he isn't up to the mark! but who are those who are,
LINE 531: in every respect, up to the mark? These young fellows have grown up
LINE 532: already to this age, and if they haven't eaten any pork, they have
LINE 533: nevertheless seen a pig run. If Mr. Chen has deputed him to go, he is
LINE 534: simply meant to sit under the general's standard; and do you imagine,
LINE 535: forsooth, that he has, in real earnest, told him to go and bargain about
LINE 536: the purchase money, and to interview the brokers himself? My own idea is
LINE 537: that (the choice) is a very good one."
LINE 538: "Of course it is!" observed Chia Lien; "but it isn't that I entertain
LINE 539: any wish to be factious; my only object is to devise some plan or other
LINE 540: for him. Whence will," he therefore went on to ask, "the money required
LINE 541: for this purpose come from?"
LINE 542: "A little while ago the deliberations reached this point," rejoined Chia
LINE 543: Se; "and Mr. Lai suggested that there was no necessity at all to take
LINE 544: any funds from the capital, as the Chen family, in Chiang Nan, had still
LINE 545: in their possession Tls. 50,000 of our money. That he would to-morrow
LINE 546: write a letter of advice and a draft for us to take along, and that we
LINE 547: should, first of all, obtain cash to the amount of Tls. 30,000, and let
LINE 548: the balance of Tls. 20,000 remain over, for the purchase of painted
LINE 549: lanterns, and coloured candles, as well as for the outlay for every kind
LINE 550: of portieres, banners, curtains and streamers."
LINE 551: Chia Lien nodded his head. "This plan is first-rate!" he added.
LINE 552: "Since that be so," observed lady Feng, as she addressed herself to Chia
LINE 553: Se, "I've two able and reliable men; and if you would take them with
LINE 554: you, to attend to these matters, won't it be to your convenience?"
LINE 555: Chia Se forced a smile. "I was just on the point," he rejoined, "of
LINE 556: asking you, aunt, for the loan of two men, so that this suggestion is a
LINE 557: strange coincidence."
LINE 558: As he went on to ascertain what were their names, lady Feng inquired
LINE 559: what they were of nurse Chao. But nurse Chao had, by this time, become
LINE 560: quite dazed from listening to the conversation, and P'ing Erh had to
LINE 561: give her a push, as she smiled, before she returned to consciousness.
LINE 562: "The one," she hastened to reply, "is called Chao T'ien-liang and the
LINE 563: other Chao T'ien-tung."
LINE 564: "Whatever you do," suggested lady Feng, "don't forget them; but now I'm
LINE 565: off to look after my duties."
LINE 566: With these words, she left the room, and Chia Jung promptly followed her
LINE 567: out, and with gentle voice he said to her: "Of whatever you want, aunt,
LINE 568: issue orders that a list be drawn up, and I'll give it to my brother to
LINE 569: take with him, and he'll carry out your commissions according to the
LINE 570: list."
LINE 571: "Don't talk nonsense!" replied lady Feng laughing; "I've found no place,
LINE 572: as yet, where I could put away all my own things; and do the stealthy
LINE 573: practices of you people take my fancy?"
LINE 574: As she uttered these words she straightway went her way.
LINE 575: Chia Se, at this time, likewise, asked Chia Lien: "If you want anything
LINE 576: (in the way of curtains), I can conveniently have them woven for you,
LINE 577: along with the rest, and bring them as a present to you."
LINE 578: "Don't be in such high glee!" Chia Lien urged with a grin, "you've but
LINE 579: recently been learning how to do business, and have you come first and
LINE 580: foremost to excel in tricks of this kind? If I require anything, I'll of
LINE 581: course write and tell you, but we needn't talk about it."
LINE 582: Having finished speaking, he dismissed the two young men; and, in quick
LINE 583: succession, servants came to make their business reports, not limited to
LINE 584: three and five companies, but as Chia Lien felt exhausted, he forthwith
LINE 585: sent word to those on duty at the second gate not to allow any one at
LINE 586: all to communicate any reports, and that the whole crowd should wait
LINE 587: till the next day, when he would give his mind to what had to be done.
LINE 588: Lady Feng did not come to retire to rest till the third watch; but
LINE 589: nothing need be said about the whole night.
LINE 590: The next morning, at an early hour, Chia Lien got up and called on Chia
LINE 591: She and Chia Cheng; after which, he came over to the Ning Kuo mansion;
LINE 592: when, in company with the old major-domos and other servants, as well as
LINE 593: with several old family friends and companions, he inspected the grounds
LINE 594: of the two mansions, and drew plans of the palatial buildings (for the
LINE 595: accommodation of the Imperial consort and her escort) on her visit to
LINE 596: her parents; deliberating at the same time, on the subject of the works
LINE 597: and workmen.
LINE 598: From this day the masons and workmen of every trade were collected to
LINE 599: the full number; and the articles of gold, silver, copper, and pewter,
LINE 600: as well as the earth, timber, tiles, and bricks, were brought over, and
LINE 601: carried in, in incessant supplies. In the first place, orders were
LINE 602: issued to the workmen to demolish the wall and towers of the garden of
LINE 603: Concentrated Fragrance, and extend a passage to connect in a straight
LINE 604: line with the large court in the East of the Jung mansion; for the whole
LINE 605: extent of servants' quarters on the Eastern side of the Jung mansion had
LINE 606: previously been pulled down.
LINE 607: The two residences of Ning and Jung were, in these days, it is true,
LINE 608: divided by a small street, which served as a boundary line, and there
LINE 609: was no communication between them, but this narrow passage was also
LINE 610: private property, and not in any way a government street, so that they
LINE 611: could easily be connected, and as in the garden of Concentrated
LINE 612: Fragrance, there was already a stream of running water, which had been
LINE 613: introduced through the corner of the Northern wall, there was no further
LINE 614: need now of going to the trouble of bringing in another. Although the
LINE 615: rockeries and trees were not sufficient, the place where Chia She lived,
LINE 616: was an old garden of the Jung mansion, so that the bamboos, trees, and
LINE 617: rockeries in that compound, as well as the arbours, railings and other
LINE 618: such things could all be very well removed to the front; and by these
LINE 619: means, these two grounds, situated as they were besides so very near to
LINE 620: each other, could, by being thrown into one, conduce to the saving of
LINE 621: considerable capital and labour; for, in spite of some deficiency, what
LINE 622: had to be supplied did not amount to much. And it devolved entirely upon
LINE 623: a certain old Hu, a man of note, styled Shan Tzu-yeh, to deliberate upon
LINE 624: one thing after another, and to initiate its construction.
LINE 625: Chia Cheng was not up to these ordinary matters, so that it fell to Chia
LINE 626: She, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Lai Ta, Lai Sheng, Lin Chih-hsiao, Wu
LINE 627: Hsin-teng, Chan Kuang, Ch'eng Jih-hsing and several others to allot the
LINE 628: sites, to set things in order, (and to look after) the heaping up of
LINE 629: rockeries, the digging of ponds, the construction of two-storied
LINE 630: buildings, the erection of halls, the plantation of bamboos and the
LINE 631: cultivation of flowers, everything connected with the improvement of the
LINE 632: scenery devolving, on the other hand, upon Shan Tzu-yeh to make
LINE 633: provision for, and after leaving Court, he would devote such leisure
LINE 634: moments as he had to merely going everywhere to give a look at the most
LINE 635: important spots, and to consult with Chia She and the others; after
LINE 636: which he troubled his mind no more with anything. And as Chia She did
LINE 637: nothing else than stay at home and lie off, whenever any matter turned
LINE 638: up, trifling though it may have been as a grain of mustard seed or a
LINE 639: bean, Chia Chen and his associates had either to go and report it in
LINE 640: person or to write a memorandum of it. Or if he had anything to say, he
LINE 641: sent for Chia Lien, Lai Ta and others to come and receive his
LINE 642: instructions. Chia Jung had the sole direction of the manufacture of the
LINE 643: articles in gold and silver; and as for Chia Se, he had already set out
LINE 644: on his journey to Ku Su. Chia Chen, Lai Ta and the rest had also to call
LINE 645: out the roll with the names of the workmen, to superintend the works and
LINE 646: other duties relative thereto, which could not be recorded by one pen
LINE 647: alone; sufficient to say that a great bustle and stir prevailed, but to
LINE 648: this subject we shall not refer for a time, but allude to Pao-yü.
LINE 649: As of late there were in the household concerns of this magnitude to
LINE 650: attend to, Chia Cheng did not come to examine him in his lessons, so
LINE 651: that he was, of course, in high spirits, but, as unfortunately Ch'in
LINE 652: Chung's complaint became, day by day, more serious, he was at the same
LINE 653: time really so very distressed at heart on his account, that enjoyment
LINE 654: was for him out of the question.
LINE 655: On this day, he got up as soon as it was dawn, and having just combed
LINE 656: his hair and washed his face and hands, he was bent upon going to ask
LINE 657: dowager lady Chia to allow him to pay a visit to Ch'in Chung, when he
LINE 658: suddenly espied Ming Yen peep round the curtain-wall at the second gate,
LINE 659: and then withdraw his head. Pao-yü promptly walked out and inquired what
LINE 660: he was up to.
LINE 661: "Mr. Ch'in Chung," observed Ming Yen, "is not well at all."
LINE 662: Pao-yü at these words was quite taken aback. "It was only yesterday," he
LINE 663: hastily added, "that I saw him, and he was still bright and cheery; and
LINE 664: how is it that he's anything but well now?"
LINE 665: "I myself can't explain," replied Ming Yen; "but just a few minutes ago
LINE 666: an old man belonging to his family came over with the express purpose of
LINE 667: giving me the tidings."
LINE 668: Upon hearing this news, Pao-yü there and then turned round and told
LINE 669: dowager lady Chia; and the old lady issued directions to depute some
LINE 670: trustworthy persons to accompany him. "Let him go," (she said), "and
LINE 671: satisfy his feelings towards his fellow-scholar; but as soon as he has
LINE 672: done, he must come back; and don't let him tarry too long."
LINE 673: Pao-yü with hurried step left the room and came and changed his clothes.
LINE 674: But as on his arrival outside, the carriage had not as yet been got
LINE 675: ready, he fell into such a state of excitement, that he went round and
LINE 676: round all over the hall in quite an erratic manner. In a short while,
LINE 677: after pressure had been brought to bear, the carriage arrived, and
LINE 678: speedily mounting the vehicle, he drove up to the door of Ch'in Chung's
LINE 679: house, followed by Li Kuei, Ming Yen and the other servants. Everything
LINE 680: was quiet. Not a soul was about. Like a hive of bees they flocked into
LINE 681: the house, to the astonishment of two distant aunts, and of several male
LINE 682: cousins of Ch'in Chung, all of whom had no time to effect their retreat.
LINE 683: Ch'in Chung had, by this time, had two or three fainting fits, and had
LINE 684: already long ago been changed his mat. As soon as Pao-yü realised the
LINE 685: situation, he felt unable to repress himself from bursting forth aloud.
LINE 686: Li Kuei promptly reasoned with him. "You shouldn't go on in this way,"
LINE 687: he urged, "you shouldn't. It's because Mr. Ch'in is so weak that lying
LINE 688: flat on the stove-couch naturally made his bones feel uncomfortable; and
LINE 689: that's why he has temporarily been removed down here to ease him a
LINE 690: little. But if you, sir, go on in this way, will you not, instead of
LINE 691: doing him any good, aggravate his illness?"
LINE 692: At these words, Pao-yü accordingly restrained himself, and held his
LINE 693: tongue; and drawing near, he gazed at Ch'in Chung's face, which was as
LINE 694: white as wax, while with closed eyes, he gasped for breath, rolling
LINE 695: about on his pillow.
LINE 696: "Brother Ching," speedily exclaimed Pao-yü, "Pao-yü is here!" But though
LINE 697: he shouted out two or three consecutive times, Ch'in Chung did not heed
LINE 698: him.
LINE 699: "Pao-yü has come!" Pao-yü went on again to cry. But Ch'in Chung's spirit
LINE 700: had already departed from his body, leaving behind only a faint breath
LINE 701: of superfluous air in his lungs.
LINE 702: He had just caught sight of a number of recording devils, holding a
LINE 703: warrant and carrying chains, coming to seize him, but Ch'in Chung's soul
LINE 704: would on no account go along with them; and remembering how that there
LINE 705: was in his home no one to assume the direction of domestic affairs, and
LINE 706: feeling concerned that Chih Neng had as yet no home, he consequently
LINE 707: used hundreds of arguments in his entreaties to the recording devils;
LINE 708: but alas! these devils would, none of them, show him any favour. On the
LINE 709: contrary, they heaped invectives upon Ch'in Chung.
LINE 710: "You're fortunate enough to be a man of letters," they insinuated, "and
LINE 711: don't you know the common saying that: 'if the Prince of Hell call upon
LINE 712: you to die at the third watch, who can presume to retain you, a human
LINE 713: being, up to the fifth watch?' In our abode, in the unseen, high as well
LINE 714: as low, have all alike a face made of iron, and heed not selfish
LINE 715: motives; unlike the mortal world, where favouritism and partiality
LINE 716: prevail. There exist therefore many difficulties in the way (to our
LINE 717: yielding to your wishes)."
LINE 718: While this fuss was going on, Ch'in Chung's spirit suddenly grasped the
LINE 719: four words, "Pao-yü has come," and without loss of time, it went on
LINE 720: again to make further urgent appeals. "Gentlemen, spiritual deputies,"
LINE 721: it exclaimed; "show me a little mercy and allow me to return to make
LINE 722: just one remark to an intimate friend of mine, and I'll be back again."
LINE 723: "What intimate friend is this again?" the devils observed with one
LINE 724: voice.
LINE 725: "I'm not deceiving you, gentlemen," rejoined Ch'in Chung; "it's the
LINE 726: grandson of the duke of Jung Kuo, whose infant name is Pao-yü."
LINE 727: The Decider of life was, at first, upon hearing these words, so seized
LINE 728: with dismay that he vehemently abused the devils sent on the errand.
LINE 729: "I told you," he shouted, "to let him go back for a turn; but you would
LINE 730: by no means comply with my words! and now do you wait until he has
LINE 731: summoned a man of glorious fortune and prosperous standing to at last
LINE 732: desist?"
LINE 733: When the company of devils perceived the manner of the Decider of life,
LINE 734: they were all likewise so seized with consternation that they bustled
LINE 735: with hand and feet; while with hearts also full of resentment: "You,
LINE 736: sir," they replied, "were at one time such a terror, formidable as
LINE 737: lightning; and are you not forsooth able to listen with equanimity to
LINE 738: the two sounds of 'Pao-yü?' our humble idea is that mortal as he is, and
LINE 739: immortal as we are, it wouldn't be to our credit if we feared him!"
LINE 740: But whether Ch'in Chung, after all, died or survived, the next chapter
LINE 741: will explain.
