LINE 1: By a strange coincidence, Chia Pao-yü becomes acquainted with the
LINE 2: golden clasp.
LINE 3: In an unexpected meeting, Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai sees the jade of spiritual
LINE 4: perception.
LINE 5: Pao-yü and lady Feng, we will now explain, paid, on their return home,
LINE 6: their respects to all the inmates, and Pao-yü availed himself of the
LINE 7: first occasion to tell dowager lady Chia of his wish that Ch'in Chung
LINE 8: should come over to the family school. "The presence for himself of a
LINE 9: friend as schoolmate would," he argued, "be fitly excellent to stir him
LINE 10: to zeal," and he went on to speak in terms of high praise of Ch'in
LINE 11: Chung, his character and his manners, which most of all made people
LINE 12: esteem him.
LINE 13: Lady Feng besides stood by him and backed his request. "In a day or
LINE 14: two," she added, "Ch'in Chung will be coming to pay his obeisance to
LINE 15: your venerable ladyship."
LINE 16: This bit of news greatly rejoiced the heart of dowager lady Chia, and
LINE 17: lady Feng likewise did not let the opportunity slip, without inviting
LINE 18: the old lady to attend the theatrical performance to come off the day
LINE 19: after the morrow. Dowager lady Chia was, it is true, well on in years,
LINE 20: but was, nevertheless, very fond of enjoyment, so that when the day
LINE 21: arrived and Mrs. Yu came over to invite her round, she forthwith took
LINE 22: madame Wang, Lin Tai-yü, Pao-yü and others along and went to the play.
LINE 23: It was about noon, when dowager lady Chia returned to her apartments for
LINE 24: her siesta; and madame Wang, who was habitually partial to a quiet life,
LINE 25: also took her departure after she had seen the old lady retire. Lady
LINE 26: Feng subsequently took the seat of honour; and the party enjoyed
LINE 27: themselves immensely till the evening, when they broke up.
LINE 28: But to return to Pao-yü. Having accompanied his grandmother Chia back
LINE 29: home, and waited till her ladyship was in her midday sleep, he had in
LINE 30: fact an inclination to return to the performance, but he was afraid lest
LINE 31: he should be a burden to Mrs. Ch'in and the rest and lest they should
LINE 32: not feel at ease. Remembering therefore that Pao Ch'ai had been at home
LINE 33: unwell for the last few days, and that he had not been to see her, he
LINE 34: was anxious to go and look her up, but he dreaded that if he went by the
LINE 35: side gate, at the back of the drawing-room, he would be prevented by
LINE 36: something or other, and fearing, what would be making matters worse,
LINE 37: lest he should come across his father, he consequently thought it better
LINE 38: to go on his way by a detour. The nurses and waiting-maids thereupon
LINE 39: came to help him to change his clothes; but they saw him not change, but
LINE 40: go out again by the second door. These nurses and maids could not help
LINE 41: following him out; but they were still under the impression that he was
LINE 42: going over to the other mansion to see the theatricals. Contrary to
LINE 43: their speculations, upon reaching the entrance hall, he forthwith went
LINE 44: to the east, then turned to the north, and walking round by the rear of
LINE 45: the hall, he happened to come face to face with two of the family
LINE 46: companions, Mr. Ch'an Kuang, and Mr. Tan T'ing-jen. As soon as they
LINE 47: caught sight of Pao-yü, they both readily drew up to him, and as they
LINE 48: smiled, the one put his arm round his waist, while the other grasped him
LINE 49: by the hand.
LINE 50: "Oh divine brother!" they both exclaimed, "this we call dreaming a
LINE 51: pleasant dream, for it's no easy thing to come across you!"
LINE 52: While continuing their remarks they paid their salutations, and inquired
LINE 53: after his health; and it was only after they had chatted for ever so
LINE 54: long, that they went on their way. The nurse called out to them and
LINE 55: stopped them, "Have you two gentlemen," she said, "come out from seeing
LINE 56: master?"
LINE 57: They both nodded assent. "Your master," they explained, "is in the Meng
LINE 58: P'o Chai small library having his siesta; so that you can go through
LINE 59: there with no fear."
LINE 60: As they uttered these words, they walked away.
LINE 61: This remark also evoked a smile from Pao-yü, but without further delay
LINE 62: he turned a corner, went towards the north, and came into the Pear
LINE 63: Fragrance Court, where, as luck would have it, he met the head manager
LINE 64: of the Household Treasury, Wu Hsin-teng, who, in company with the head
LINE 65: of the granary, Tai Liang, and several other head stewards, seven
LINE 66: persons in all, was issuing out of the Account Room.
LINE 67: On seeing Pao-yü approaching, they, in a body, stood still, and hung
LINE 68: down their arms against their sides. One of them alone, a certain
LINE 69: butler, called Ch'ien Hua, promptly came forward, as he had not seen
LINE 70: Pao-yü for many a day, and bending on one knee, paid his respects to
LINE 71: Pao-yü. Pao-yü at once gave a smile and pulled him up.
LINE 72: "The day before yesterday," smiled all the bystanders, "we were
LINE 73: somewhere together and saw some characters written by you, master
LINE 74: Secundus, in the composite style. The writing is certainly better than
LINE 75: it was before! When will you give us a few sheets to stick on the wall?"
LINE 76: "Where did you see them?" inquired Pao-yü, with a grin.
LINE 77: "They are to be found in more than one place," they replied, "and every
LINE 78: one praises them very much, and what's more, asks us for a few."
LINE 79: "They are not worth having," observed Pao-yü smilingly; "but if you do
LINE 80: want any, tell my young servants and it will be all right."
LINE 81: As he said these words, he moved onwards. The whole party waited till he
LINE 82: had gone by, before they separated, each one to go his own way.
LINE 83: But we need not dilate upon matters of no moment, but return to Pao-yü.
LINE 84: On coming to the Pear Fragrance Court, he entered, first, into "aunt"
LINE 85: Hsüeh's room, where he found her getting some needlework ready to give
LINE 86: to the waiting-maids to work at. Pao-yü forthwith paid his respects to
LINE 87: her, and "aunt" Hsüeh, taking him by the hand, drew him towards her and
LINE 88: clasped him in her embrace.
LINE 89: "With this cold weather," she smilingly urged, "it's too kind of you, my
LINE 90: dear child, to think of coming to see me; come along on the stove-couch
LINE 91: at once!--Bring some tea," she continued, addressing the servants, "and
LINE 92: make it as hot as it can be!"
LINE 93: "Isn't Hsüeh P'an at home?" Pao-yü having inquired: "He's like a horse
LINE 94: without a halter," Mrs. Hsüeh remarked with a sigh; "he's daily running
LINE 95: here and there and everywhere, and nothing can induce him to stay at
LINE 96: home one single day."
LINE 97: "Is sister (Pao Ch'ai) all right again?" asked Pao-yü. "Yes," replied
LINE 98: Mrs. Hsüeh, "she's well again. It was very kind of you two days ago to
LINE 99: again think of her, and send round to inquire after her. She's now in
LINE 100: there, and you can go and see her. It's warmer there than it's here; go
LINE 101: and sit with her inside, and, as soon as I've put everything away, I'll
LINE 102: come and join you and have a chat."
LINE 103: Pao-yü, upon hearing this, jumped down with alacrity from the
LINE 104: stove-couch, and walked up to the door of the inner room, where he saw
LINE 105: hanging a portière somewhat the worse for use, made of red silk. Pao-yü
LINE 106: raised the portière and making one step towards the interior, he found
LINE 107: Pao Ch'ai seated on the couch, busy over some needlework. On the top of
LINE 108: her head was gathered, and made into a knot, her chevelure, black as
LINE 109: lacquer, and glossy like pomade. She wore a honey-coloured wadded robe,
LINE 110: a rose-brown short-sleeved jacket, lined with the fur of the squirrel of
LINE 111: two colours: the "gold and silver;" and a jupe of leek-yellow silk. Her
LINE 112: whole costume was neither too new, neither too old, and displayed no
LINE 113: sign of extravagance.
LINE 114: Her lips, though not rouged, were naturally red; her eyebrows, though
LINE 115: not pencilled, were yet blue black; her face resembled a silver basin,
LINE 116: and her eyes, juicy plums. She was sparing in her words, chary in her
LINE 117: talk, so much so that people said that she posed as a simpleton. She was
LINE 118: quiet in the acquittal of her duties and scrupulous as to the proper
LINE 119: season for everything. "I practise simplicity," she would say of
LINE 120: herself.
LINE 121: "How are you? are you quite well again, sister?" inquired Pao-yü, as he
LINE 122: gazed at her; whereupon Pao Ch'ai raised her head, and perceiving Pao-yü
LINE 123: walk in, she got up at once and replied with a smile, "I'm all right
LINE 124: again; many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me."
LINE 125: While uttering this, she pressed him to take a seat on the stove-couch,
LINE 126: and as he sat down on the very edge of the couch, she told Ying Erh to
LINE 127: bring tea and asked likewise after dowager lady Chia and lady Feng. "And
LINE 128: are all the rest of the young ladies quite well?" she inquired.
LINE 129: Saying this she scrutinised Pao-yü, who she saw had a head-dress of
LINE 130: purplish-gold twisted threads, studded with precious stones. His
LINE 131: forehead was bound with a gold circlet, representing two dragons,
LINE 132: clasping a pearl. On his person he wore a light yellow, archery-sleeved
LINE 133: jacket, ornamented with rampant dragons, and lined with fur from the
LINE 134: ribs of the silver fox; and was clasped with a dark sash, embroidered
LINE 135: with different-coloured butterflies and birds. Round his neck was hung
LINE 136: an amulet, consisting of a clasp of longevity, a talisman of recorded
LINE 137: name, and, in addition to these, the precious jade which he had had in
LINE 138: his mouth at the time of his birth.
LINE 139: "I've daily heard every one speak of this jade," said Pao Ch'ai with a
LINE 140: smile, "but haven't, after all, had an opportunity of looking at it
LINE 141: closely, but anyhow to-day I must see it."
LINE 142: As she spoke, she drew near. Pao-yü himself approached, and taking it
LINE 143: from his neck, he placed it in Pao Ch'ai's hand. Pao Ch'ai held it in
LINE 144: her palm. It appeared to her very much like the egg of a bird,
LINE 145: resplendent as it was like a bright russet cloud; shiny and smooth like
LINE 146: variegated curd and covered with a net for the sake of protection.
LINE 147: Readers, you should know that this was the very block of useless stone
LINE 148: which had been on the Ta Huang Hills, and which had dropped into the
LINE 149: Ch'ing Keng cave, in a state of metamorphosis. A later writer expresses
LINE 150: his feelings in a satirical way as follows:
LINE 151: Nü Wo's fusion of stones was e'er a myth inane,
LINE 152: But from this myth hath sprung fiction still more insane!
LINE 153: Lost is the subtle life, divine, and real!--gone!
LINE 154: Assumed, mean subterfuge! foul bags of skin and bone!
LINE 155: Fortune, when once adverse, how true! gold glows no more!
LINE 156: In evil days, alas! the jade's splendour is o'er!
LINE 157: Bones, white and bleached, in nameless hill-like mounds are flung,
LINE 158: Bones once of youths renowned and maidens fair and young.
LINE 159: The rejected stone has in fact already given a record of the
LINE 160: circumstances of its transformation, and the inscription in seal
LINE 161: characters, engraved upon it by the bald-headed bonze, and below will
LINE 162: now be also appended a faithful representation of it; but its real size
LINE 163: is so very diminutive, as to allow of its being held by a child in his
LINE 164: mouth while yet unborn, that were it to have been drawn in its exact
LINE 165: proportions, the characters would, it is feared, have been so
LINE 166: insignificant in size, that the beholder would have had to waste much of
LINE 167: his eyesight, and it would besides have been no pleasant thing.
LINE 168: While therefore its shape has been adhered to, its size has unavoidably
LINE 169: been slightly enlarged, to admit of the reader being able, conveniently,
LINE 170: to peruse the inscription, even by very lamplight, and though he may be
LINE 171: under the influence of wine.
LINE 172: These explanations have been given to obviate any such sneering remarks
LINE 173: as: "What could be, pray, the size of the mouth of a child in his
LINE 174: mother's womb, and how could it grasp such a large and clumsy thing?"
LINE 175: On the face of the jade was written:
LINE 176: Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.
LINE 177: If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,
LINE 178: Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!
LINE 179: On the reverse was written:
LINE 180: 1 To exorcise evil spirits and the accessory visitations;
LINE 181: 2 To cure predestined sickness;
LINE 182: 3 To prognosticate weal and woe.
LINE 183: Pao Ch'ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, and
LINE 184: scrutinising it closely, read aloud:
LINE 185: If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,
LINE 186: Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!
LINE 187: She perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked Ying Erh
LINE 188: laughingly: "Why don't you go and pour the tea? what are you standing
LINE 189: here like an idiot!"
LINE 190: "These two lines which I've heard," smiled Ying Erh, "would appear to
LINE 191: pair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!"
LINE 192: "What!" eagerly observed Pao-yü with a grin, when he caught these words,
LINE 193: "are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do let
LINE 194: me too see it."
LINE 195: "Don't listen to what she says," remarked Pao Ch'ai, "there are no
LINE 196: characters on it."
LINE 197: "My dear cousin," pleaded Pao-yü entreatingly, "how is it you've seen
LINE 198: mine?"
LINE 199: Pao Ch'ai was brought quite at bay by this remark of his, and she
LINE 200: consequently added, "There are also two propitious phrases engraved on
LINE 201: this charm, and that's why I wear it every day. Otherwise, what pleasure
LINE 202: would there be in carrying a clumsy thing."
LINE 203: As she spoke, she unfastened the button, and produced from inside her
LINE 204: crimson robe, a crystal-like locket, set with pearls and gems, and with
LINE 205: a brilliant golden fringe. Pao-yü promptly received it from her, and
LINE 206: upon minute examination, found that there were in fact four characters
LINE 207: on each side; the eight characters on both sides forming two sentences
LINE 208: of good omen. The similitude of the locket is likewise then given below.
LINE 209: On the face of the locket is written:
LINE 210: "Part not from me and cast me not away;"
LINE 211: And on the reverse:
LINE 212: "And youth, perennial freshness will display!"
LINE 213: Pao-yü examined the charm, and having also read the inscription twice
LINE 214: over aloud, and then twice again to himself, he said as he smiled, "Dear
LINE 215: cousin, these eight characters of yours form together with mine an
LINE 216: antithetical verse."
LINE 217: "They were presented to her," ventured Ying Erh, "by a mangy-pated
LINE 218: bonze, who explained that they should be engraved on a golden
LINE 219: trinket...."
LINE 220: Pao Ch'ai left her no time to finish what she wished to say, but
LINE 221: speedily called her to task for not going to bring the tea, and then
LINE 222: inquired of Pao-yü "Where he had come from?"
LINE 223: Pao-yü had, by this time, drawn quite close to Pao Ch'ai, and perceived
LINE 224: whiff after whiff of some perfume or other, of what kind he could not
LINE 225: tell. "What perfume have you used, my cousin," he forthwith asked, "to
LINE 226: fumigate your dresses with? I really don't remember smelling any
LINE 227: perfumery of the kind before."
LINE 228: "I'm very averse," replied Pao Ch'ai blandly, "to the odour of
LINE 229: fumigation; good clothes become impregnated with the smell of smoke."
LINE 230: "In that case," observed Pao-yü, "what scent is it?"
LINE 231: "Yes, I remember," Pao Ch'ai answered, after some reflection; "it's the
LINE 232: scent of the 'cold fragrance' pills which I took this morning."
LINE 233: "What are these cold fragrance pills," remarked Pao-yü smiling, "that
LINE 234: they have such a fine smell? Give me, cousin, a pill to try."
LINE 235: "Here you are with your nonsense again," Pao Ch'ai rejoined laughingly;
LINE 236: "is a pill a thing to be taken recklessly?"
LINE 237: She had scarcely finished speaking, when she heard suddenly some one
LINE 238: outside say, "Miss Lin is come;" and shortly Lin Tai-yü walked in in a
LINE 239: jaunty manner.
LINE 240: "Oh, I come at a wrong moment!" she exclaimed forthwith, smirking
LINE 241: significantly when she caught sight of Pao-yü.
LINE 242: Pao-yü and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat,
LINE 243: whereupon Pao Ch'ai added with a smile, "How can you say such things?"
LINE 244: "Had I known sooner," continued Tai-yü, "that he was here, I would have
LINE 245: kept away."
LINE 246: "I can't fathom this meaning of yours," protested Pao Ch'ai.
LINE 247: "If one comes," Tai-yü urged smiling, "then all come, and when one
LINE 248: doesn't come, then no one comes. Now were he to come to-day, and I to
LINE 249: come to-morrow, wouldn't there be, by a division of this kind, always
LINE 250: some one with you every day? and in this way, you wouldn't feel too
LINE 251: lonely, nor too crowded. How is it, cousin, that you didn't understand
LINE 252: what I meant to imply?"
LINE 253: "Is it snowing?" inquired Pao-yü, upon noticing that she wore a cloak
LINE 254: made of crimson camlet, buttoning in front.
LINE 255: "It has been snowing for some time," ventured the matrons, who were
LINE 256: standing below. "Fetch my wrapper!" Pao-yü remarked, and Tai-yü readily
LINE 257: laughed. "Am I not right? I come, and, of course, he must go at once."
LINE 258: "Did I ever mention that I was going?" questioned Pao-yü; "I only wish
LINE 259: it brought to have it ready when I want it."
LINE 260: "It's a snowy day," consequently remarked Pao-yü's nurse, dame Li, "and
LINE 261: we must also look to the time, but you had better remain here and amuse
LINE 262: yourself with your cousin. Your aunt has, in there, got ready tea and
LINE 263: fruits. I'll tell the waiting-maid to go and fetch your wrapper and the
LINE 264: boys to return home." Pao-yü assented, and nurse Li left the room and
LINE 265: told the boys that they were at liberty to go.
LINE 266: By this time Mrs. Hsüeh had prepared tea and several kinds of nice
LINE 267: things and kept them all to partake of those delicacies. Pao-yü, having
LINE 268: spoken highly of some goose feet and ducks' tongues he had tasted some
LINE 269: days before, at his eldest sister-in-law's, Mrs. Yu's, "aunt" Hsüeh
LINE 270: promptly produced several dishes of the same kind, made by herself, and
LINE 271: gave them to Pao-yü to try. "With a little wine," added Pao-yü with a
LINE 272: smile, "they would be first rate."
LINE 273: Mrs. Hsüeh thereupon bade the servants fetch some wine of the best
LINE 274: quality; but dame Li came forward and remonstrated. "My lady," she said,
LINE 275: "never mind the wine."
LINE 276: Pao-yü smilingly pleaded: "My nurse, I'll take just one cup and no
LINE 277: more."
LINE 278: "It's no use," nurse Li replied, "were your grandmother and mother
LINE 279: present, I wouldn't care if you drank a whole jar. I remember the day
LINE 280: when I turned my eyes away but for a moment, and some ignorant fool or
LINE 281: other, merely with the view of pandering for your favour, gave you only
LINE 282: a drop of wine to drink, and how this brought reproaches upon me for a
LINE 283: couple of days. You don't know, my lady, you have no idea of his
LINE 284: disposition! it's really dreadful; and when he has had a little wine he
LINE 285: shows far more temper. On days when her venerable ladyship is in high
LINE 286: spirits, she allows him to have his own way about drinking, but he's not
LINE 287: allowed to have wine on any and every day; and why should I have to
LINE 288: suffer inside and all for nothing at all?"
LINE 289: "You antiquated thing!" replied Mrs. Hsüeh laughing, "set your mind at
LINE 290: ease, and go and drink your own wine! I won't let him have too much, and
LINE 291: should even the old lady say anything, let the fault be mine."
LINE 292: Saying this, she asked a waiting-maid to take nurse Li along with her
LINE 293: and give her also a glass of wine so as to keep out the cold air.
LINE 294: When nurse Li heard these words, she had no alternative but to go for a
LINE 295: time with all the others and have some wine to drink.
LINE 296: "The wine need not be warmed: I prefer it cold!" Pao-yü went on to
LINE 297: suggest meanwhile.
LINE 298: "That won't do," remonstrated Mrs. Hsüeh; "cold wine will make your hand
LINE 299: tremble when you write."
LINE 300: "You have," interposed Pao Ch'ai smiling, "the good fortune, cousin
LINE 301: Pao-yü, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of every
LINE 302: kind of subject, and yet don't you know that the properties of wine are
LINE 303: mostly heating? If you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but if
LINE 304: you drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon your
LINE 305: intestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm?
LINE 306: and won't you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave off
LINE 307: at once drinking that cold wine."
LINE 308: Pao-yü finding that the words he had heard contained a good deal of
LINE 309: sense, speedily put down the cold wine, and having asked them to warm
LINE 310: it, he at length drank it.
LINE 311: Tai-yü was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simply
LINE 312: pursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, Hsüeh Yen,
LINE 313: Tai-yü's waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a small
LINE 314: hand-stove.
LINE 315: "Who told you to bring it?" ascertained Tai-yü grinningly. "I'm sorry to
LINE 316: have given whoever it is the trouble; I'm obliged to her. But did she
LINE 317: ever imagine that I would freeze to death?"
LINE 318: "Tzu Chuan was afraid," replied Hsüeh Yen, "that you would, miss, feel
LINE 319: cold, and she asked me to bring it over."
LINE 320: Tai-yü took it over and held it in her lap. "How is it," she smiled,
LINE 321: "that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what I say,
LINE 322: day after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! How is it that
LINE 323: you at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you
LINE 324: would an imperial edict?"
LINE 325: When Pao-yü heard this, he felt sure in his mind that Tai-yü was
LINE 326: availing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no
LINE 327: remark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice. Pao
LINE 328: Ch'ai, again, knew full well that this habit was a weak point with
LINE 329: Tai-yü, so she too did not go out of her way to heed what she said.
LINE 330: "You've always been delicate and unable to stand the cold," interposed
LINE 331: "aunt" Hsüeh, "and is it not a kind attention on their part to have
LINE 332: thought of you?"
LINE 333: "You don't know, aunt, how it really stands," responded Tai-yü
LINE 334: smilingly; "fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters;
LINE 335: for had it been in any one else's house, wouldn't it have been a slight
LINE 336: upon them? Is it forsooth nice to think that people haven't so much as a
LINE 337: hand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? People
LINE 338: won't say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imagine
LINE 339: that I'm in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion."
LINE 340: "You're far too punctilious," remarked Mrs. Hsüeh, "as to entertain such
LINE 341: notions! No such ideas as these crossed my mind just now."
LINE 342: While they were conversing, Pao-yü had taken so much as three cups of
LINE 343: wine, and nurse Li came forward again to prevent him from having any
LINE 344: more. Pao-yü was just then in a state of exultation and excitement, (a
LINE 345: state) enhanced by the conversation and laughter of his cousins, so that
LINE 346: was he ready to agree to having no more! But he was constrained in a
LINE 347: humble spirit to entreat for permission. "My dear nurse," he implored,
LINE 348: "I'll just take two more cups and then have no more."
LINE 349: "You'd better be careful," added nurse Li, "your father is at home
LINE 350: to-day, and see that you're ready to be examined in your lessons."
LINE 351: When Pao-yü heard this mention, his spirits at once sank within him, and
LINE 352: gently putting the wine aside, he dropped his head upon his breast.
LINE 353: Tai-yü promptly remonstrated. "You've thrown cold water," she said,
LINE 354: "over the spirits of the whole company; why, if uncle should ask to see
LINE 355: you, well, say that aunt Hsüeh detained you. This old nurse of yours has
LINE 356: been drinking, and again makes us the means of clearing her muddled
LINE 357: head!"
LINE 358: While saying this, she gave Pao-yü a big nudge with the intent of
LINE 359: stirring up his spirits, adding, as she addressed him in a low tone of
LINE 360: voice: "Don't let us heed that old thing, but mind our own enjoyment."
LINE 361: Dame Li also knew very well Tai-yü's disposition, and therefore
LINE 362: remarked: "Now, Miss Lin, don't you urge him on; you should after all,
LINE 363: give him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of what
LINE 364: you say to him."
LINE 365: "Why should I urge him on?" rejoined Lin Tai-yü, with a sarcastic smile,
LINE 366: "nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are far
LINE 367: too scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine,
LINE 368: and if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt's, lady Hsüeh's
LINE 369: house, there's no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, that
LINE 370: aunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact no
LINE 371: right to come over here to see her?"
LINE 372: Nurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard.
LINE 373: "Really," she observed, "every remark this girl Lin utters is sharper
LINE 374: than a razor! I didn't say anything much!"
LINE 375: Pao Ch'ai too could not suppress a smile, and as she pinched Tai-yü's
LINE 376: cheek, she exclaimed, "Oh the tongue of this frowning girl! one can
LINE 377: neither resent what it says, nor yet listen to it with any
LINE 378: gratification!"
LINE 379: "Don't be afraid!" Mrs. Hsüeh went on to say, "don't be afraid; my son,
LINE 380: you've come to see me, and although I've nothing good to give you, you
LINE 381: mustn't, through fright, let the trifle you've taken lie heavy on your
LINE 382: stomach, and thus make me uneasy; but just drink at your pleasure, and
LINE 383: as much as you like, and let the blame fall on my shoulders. What's
LINE 384: more, you can stay to dinner with me, and then go home; or if you do get
LINE 385: tipsy, you can sleep with me, that's all."
LINE 386: She thereupon told the servants to heat some more wine. "I'll come," she
LINE 387: continued, "and keep you company while you have two or three cups, after
LINE 388: which we'll have something to eat!"
LINE 389: It was only after these assurances that Pao-yü's spirits began at
LINE 390: length, once more to revive, and dame Li then directed the waiting-maids
LINE 391: what to do. "You remain here," she enjoined, "and mind, be diligent
LINE 392: while I go home and change; when I'll come back again. Don't allow him,"
LINE 393: she also whispered to "aunt" Hsüeh, "to have all his own way and drink
LINE 394: too much."
LINE 395: Having said this, she betook herself back to her quarters; and during
LINE 396: this while, though there were two or three nurses in attendance, they
LINE 397: did not concern themselves with what was going on. As soon as they saw
LINE 398: that nurse Li had left, they likewise all quietly slipped out, at the
LINE 399: first opportunity they found, while there remained but two
LINE 400: waiting-maids, who were only too glad to curry favour with Pao-yü. But
LINE 401: fortunately "aunt" Hsüeh, by much coaxing and persuading, only let him
LINE 402: have a few cups, and the wine being then promptly cleared away, pickled
LINE 403: bamboo shoots and chicken-skin soup were prepared, of which Pao-yü drank
LINE 404: with relish several bowls full, eating besides more than half a bowl of
LINE 405: finest rice congee.
LINE 406: By this time, Hsüeh Pao Ch'ai and Lin Tai-yü had also finished their
LINE 407: repast; and when Pao-yü had drunk a few cups of strong tea, Mrs. Hsüeh
LINE 408: felt more easy in her mind. Hsüeh Yen and the others, three or four of
LINE 409: them in all, had also had their meal, and came in to wait upon them.
LINE 410: "Are you now going or not?" inquired Tai-yü of Pao-yü.
LINE 411: Pao-yü looked askance with his drowsy eyes. "If you want to go," he
LINE 412: observed, "I'll go with you."
LINE 413: Tai-yü hearing this, speedily rose. "We've been here nearly the whole
LINE 414: day," she said, "and ought to be going back."
LINE 415: As she spoke the two of them bade good-bye, and the waiting-maids at
LINE 416: once presented a hood to each of them.
LINE 417: Pao-yü readily lowered his head slightly and told a waiting-maid to put
LINE 418: it on. The girl promptly took the hood, made of deep red cloth, and
LINE 419: shaking it out of its folds, she put it on Pao-yü's head.
LINE 420: "That will do," hastily exclaimed Pao-yü. "You stupid thing! gently a
LINE 421: bit; is it likely you've never seen any one put one on before? let me do
LINE 422: it myself."
LINE 423: "Come over here, and I'll put it on for you," suggested Tai-yü, as she
LINE 424: stood on the edge of the couch. Pao-yü eagerly approached her, and
LINE 425: Tai-yü carefully kept the cap, to which his hair was bound, fast down,
LINE 426: and taking the hood she rested its edge on the circlet round his
LINE 427: forehead. She then raised the ball of crimson velvet, which was as large
LINE 428: as a walnut, and put it in such a way that, as it waved tremulously, it
LINE 429: should appear outside the hood. These arrangements completed she cast a
LINE 430: look for a while at what she had done. "That's right now," she added,
LINE 431: "throw your wrapper over you!"
LINE 432: When Pao-yü caught these words, he eventually took the wrapper and threw
LINE 433: it over his shoulders.
LINE 434: "None of your nurses," hurriedly interposed aunt Hsüeh, "are yet come,
LINE 435: so you had better wait a while."
LINE 436: "Why should we wait for them?" observed Pao-yü. "We have the
LINE 437: waiting-maids to escort us, and surely they should be enough."
LINE 438: Mrs. Hsüeh finding it difficult to set her mind at ease deputed two
LINE 439: married women to accompany the two cousins; and after they had both
LINE 440: expressed (to these women) their regret at having troubled them, they
LINE 441: came straightway to dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments.
LINE 442: Her venerable ladyship had not, as yet, had her evening repast. Hearing
LINE 443: that they had been at Mrs. Hsüeh's, she was extremely pleased; but
LINE 444: noticing that Pao-yü had had some wine, she gave orders that he should
LINE 445: be taken to his room, and put to bed, and not be allowed to come out
LINE 446: again.
LINE 447: "Do take good care of him," she therefore enjoined the servants, and
LINE 448: when suddenly she bethought herself of Pao-yü's attendants, "How is it,"
LINE 449: she at once inquired of them all, "that I don't see nurse Li here?"
LINE 450: They did not venture to tell her the truth, that she had gone home, but
LINE 451: simply explained that she had come in a few moments back, and that they
LINE 452: thought she must have again gone out on some business or other.
LINE 453: "She's better off than your venerable ladyship," remarked Pao-yü,
LINE 454: turning round and swaying from side to side. "Why then ask after her?
LINE 455: Were I rid of her, I believe I might live a little longer."
LINE 456: While uttering these words, he reached the door of his bedroom, where he
LINE 457: saw pen and ink laid out on the writing table.
LINE 458: "That's nice," exclaimed Ch'ing Wen, as she came to meet him with a
LINE 459: smile on her face, "you tell me to prepare the ink for you, but though
LINE 460: when you get up, you were full of the idea of writing, you only wrote
LINE 461: three characters, when you discarded the pencil, and ran away, fooling
LINE 462: me, by making me wait the whole day! Come now at once and exhaust all
LINE 463: this ink before you're let off."
LINE 464: Pao-yü then remembered what had taken place in the morning. "Where are
LINE 465: the three characters I wrote?" he consequently inquired, smiling.
LINE 466: "Why this man is tipsy," remarked Ch'ing Wen sneeringly. "As you were
LINE 467: going to the other mansion, you told me to stick them over the door. I
LINE 468: was afraid lest any one else should spoil them, as they were being
LINE 469: pasted, so I climbed up a high ladder and was ever so long in putting
LINE 470: them up myself; my hands are even now numb with cold."
LINE 471: "Oh I forgot all about it," replied Pao-yü grinning, "if your hands are
LINE 472: cold, come and I'll rub them warm for you."
LINE 473: Promptly stretching out his hand, he took those of Ch'ing Wen in his,
LINE 474: and the two of them looked at the three characters, which he recently
LINE 475: had written, and which were pasted above the door. In a short while,
LINE 476: Tai-yü came.
LINE 477: "My dear cousin," Pao-yü said to her smilingly, "tell me without any
LINE 478: prevarication which of the three characters is the best written?"
LINE 479: Tai-yü raised her head and perceived the three characters: Red, Rue,
LINE 480: Hall. "They're all well done," she rejoined, with a smirk, "How is it
LINE 481: you've written them so well? By and bye you must also write a tablet for
LINE 482: me."
LINE 483: "Are you again making fun of me?" asked Pao-yü smiling; "what about
LINE 484: sister Hsi Jen?" he went on to inquire.
LINE 485: Ch'ing Wen pouted her lips, pointing towards the stove-couch in the
LINE 486: inner room, and, on looking in, Pao-yü espied Hsi Jen fast asleep in her
LINE 487: daily costume.
LINE 488: "Well," Pao-yü observed laughing, "there's no harm in it, but its rather
LINE 489: early to sleep. When I was having my early meal, on the other side," he
LINE 490: proceeded, speaking to Ch'ing Wen, "there was a small dish of dumplings,
LINE 491: with bean-curd outside; and as I thought you would like to have some, I
LINE 492: asked Mrs. Yu for them, telling her that I would keep them, and eat them
LINE 493: in the evening; I told some one to bring them over, but have you
LINE 494: perchance seen them?"
LINE 495: "Be quick and drop that subject," suggested Ch'ing Wen; "as soon as they
LINE 496: were brought over, I at once knew they were intended for me; as I had
LINE 497: just finished my meal, I put them by in there, but when nurse Li came
LINE 498: she saw them. 'Pao-yü,' she said, 'is not likely to eat them, so I'll
LINE 499: take them and give them to my grandson.' And forthwith she bade some one
LINE 500: take them over to her home."
LINE 501: While she was speaking, Hsi Hsüeh brought in tea, and Pao-yü pressed his
LINE 502: cousin Lin to have a cup.
LINE 503: "Miss Lin has gone long ago," observed all of them, as they burst out
LINE 504: laughing, "and do you offer her tea?"
LINE 505: Pao-yü drank about half a cup, when he also suddenly bethought himself
LINE 506: of some tea, which had been brewed in the morning. "This morning," he
LINE 507: therefore inquired of Hsi Hsüeh, "when you made a cup of maple-dew tea,
LINE 508: I told you that that kind of tea requires brewing three or four times
LINE 509: before its colour appears; and how is that you now again bring me this
LINE 510: tea?"
LINE 511: "I did really put it by," answered Hsi Hsüeh, "but nurse Li came and
LINE 512: drank it, and then went off."
LINE 513: Pao-yü upon hearing this, dashed the cup he held in his hand on the
LINE 514: ground, and as it broke into small fragments, with a crash, it spattered
LINE 515: Hsi Hsüeh's petticoat all over.
LINE 516: "Of whose family is she the mistress?" inquired Pao-yü of Hsi Hsüeh, as
LINE 517: he jumped up, "that you all pay such deference to her. I just simply had
LINE 518: a little of her milk, when I was a brat, and that's all; and now she has
LINE 519: got into the way of thinking herself more high and mighty than even the
LINE 520: heads of the family! She should be packed off, and then we shall all
LINE 521: have peace and quiet."
LINE 522: Saying this, he was bent upon going, there and then, to tell dowager
LINE 523: lady Chia to have his nurse driven away.
LINE 524: Hsi Jen was really not asleep, but simply feigning, with the idea, when
LINE 525: Pao-yü came, to startle him in play. At first, when she heard him speak
LINE 526: of writing, and inquire after the dumplings, she did not think it
LINE 527: necessary to get up, but when he flung the tea-cup on the floor, and got
LINE 528: into a temper, she promptly jumped up and tried to appease him, and to
LINE 529: prevent him by coaxing from carrying out his threat.
LINE 530: A waiting-maid sent by dowager lady Chia came in, meanwhile, to ask what
LINE 531: was the matter.
LINE 532: "I had just gone to pour tea," replied Hsi Jen, without the least
LINE 533: hesitation, "and I slipped on the snow and fell, while the cup dropped
LINE 534: from my hand and broke. Your decision to send her away is good," she
LINE 535: went on to advise Pao-yü, "and we are all willing to go also; and why
LINE 536: not avail yourself of this opportunity to dismiss us in a body? It will
LINE 537: be for our good, and you too on the other hand, needn't perplex yourself
LINE 538: about not getting better people to come and wait on you!"
LINE 539: When Pao-yü heard this taunt, he had at length not a word to say, and
LINE 540: supported by Hsi Jen and the other attendants on to the couch, they
LINE 541: divested him of his clothes. But they failed to understand the drift of
LINE 542: what Pao-yü kept on still muttering, and all they could make out was an
LINE 543: endless string of words; but his eyes grew heavier and drowsier, and
LINE 544: they forthwith waited upon him until he went to sleep; when Hsi Jen
LINE 545: unclasped the jade of spiritual perception, and rolling it up in a
LINE 546: handkerchief, she lay it under the mattress, with the idea that when he
LINE 547: put it on the next day it should not chill his neck.
LINE 548: Pao-yü fell sound asleep the moment he lay his head on the pillow. By
LINE 549: this time nurse Li and the others had come in, but when they heard that
LINE 550: Pao-yü was tipsy, they too did not venture to approach, but gently made
LINE 551: inquiries as to whether he was asleep or not. On hearing that he was,
LINE 552: they took their departure with their minds more at ease.
LINE 553: The next morning the moment Pao-yü awoke, some one came in to tell him
LINE 554: that young Mr. Jung, living in the mansion on the other side, had
LINE 555: brought Ch'in Chung to pay him a visit.
LINE 556: Pao-yü speedily went out to greet them and to take them over to pay
LINE 557: their respects to dowager lady Chia. Her venerable ladyship upon
LINE 558: perceiving that Ch'in Chung, with his handsome countenance, and his
LINE 559: refined manners, would be a fit companion for Pao-yü in his studies,
LINE 560: felt extremely delighted at heart; and having readily detained him to
LINE 561: tea, and kept him to dinner, she went further and directed a servant to
LINE 562: escort him to see madame Wang and the rest of the family.
LINE 563: With the fond regard of the whole household for Mrs. Ch'in, they were,
LINE 564: when they saw what a kind of person Ch'in Chung was, so enchanted with
LINE 565: him, that at the time of his departure, they all had presents to give
LINE 566: him; even dowager lady Chia herself presented him with a purse and a
LINE 567: golden image of the God of Learning, with a view that it should incite
LINE 568: him to study and harmony.
LINE 569: "Your house," she further advised him, "is far off, and when it's cold
LINE 570: or hot, it would be inconvenient for you to come all that way, so you
LINE 571: had better come and live over here with me. You'll then be always with
LINE 572: your cousin Pao-yü, and you won't be together, in your studies, with
LINE 573: those fellow-pupils of yours who have no idea what progress means."
LINE 574: Ch'in Chung made a suitable answer to each one of her remarks, and on
LINE 575: his return home he told everything to his father.
LINE 576: His father, Ch'in Pang-yeh, held at present the post of Secretary in the
LINE 577: Peking Field Force, and was well-nigh seventy. His wife had died at an
LINE 578: early period, and as she left no issue, he adopted a son and a daughter
LINE 579: from a foundling asylum.
LINE 580: But who would have thought it, the boy also died, and there only
LINE 581: remained the girl, known as Kó Ch'ing in her infancy, who when she grew
LINE 582: up, was beautiful in face and graceful in manners, and who by reason of
LINE 583: some relationship with the Chia family, was consequently united by the
LINE 584: ties of marriage (to one of the household).
LINE 585: Ch'in Pang-yeh was in his fiftieth year when he at length got this son.
LINE 586: As his tutor had the previous year left to go south, he remained at home
LINE 587: keeping up his former lessons; and (his father) had been just thinking
LINE 588: of talking over the matter with his relatives of the Chia family, and
LINE 589: sending his son to the private school, when, as luck would have it, this
LINE 590: opportunity of meeting Pao-yü presented itself.
LINE 591: Knowing besides that the family school was under the direction of the
LINE 592: venerable scholar Chia Tai-ju, and hoping that by joining his class,
LINE 593: (his son) might advance in knowledge and by these means reap reputation,
LINE 594: he was therefore intensely gratified. The only drawbacks were that his
LINE 595: official emoluments were scanty, and that both the eyes of everyone in
LINE 596: the other establishment were set upon riches and honours, so that he
LINE 597: could not contribute anything short of the amount (given by others); but
LINE 598: his son's welfare throughout life was a serious consideration, and he,
LINE 599: needless to say, had to scrape together from the East and to collect
LINE 600: from the West; and making a parcel, with all deference, of twenty-four
LINE 601: taels for an introduction present, he came along with Ch'in Chung to
LINE 602: Tai-ju's house to pay their respects. But he had to wait subsequently
LINE 603: until Pao-yü could fix on an auspicious date on which they could
LINE 604: together enter the school.
LINE 605: As for what happened after they came to school, the next chapter will
LINE 606: divulge.
