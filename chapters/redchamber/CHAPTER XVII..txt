LINE 1: In the Ta Kuan Garden, (Broad Vista,) the merits of Pao-yü are put to
LINE 2: the test, by his being told to write devices for scrolls and
LINE 3: tablets.
LINE 4: Yuan Ch'un returns to the Jung Kuo mansion, on a visit to her parents,
LINE 5: and offers her congratulations to them on the feast of lanterns,
LINE 6: on the fifteenth of the first moon.
LINE 7: Ch'in Chung, to resume our story, departed this life, and Pao-yü went on
LINE 8: so unceasingly in his bitter lamentations, that Li Kuei and the other
LINE 9: servants had, for ever so long, an arduous task in trying to comfort him
LINE 10: before he desisted; but on his return home he was still exceedingly
LINE 11: disconsolate.
LINE 12: Dowager lady Chia afforded monetary assistance to the amount of several
LINE 13: tens of taels; and exclusive of this, she had sacrificial presents
LINE 14: likewise got ready. Pao-yü went and paid a visit of condolence to the
LINE 15: family, and after seven days the funeral and burial took place, but
LINE 16: there are no particulars about them which could be put on record.
LINE 17: Pao-yü, however, continued to mourn (his friend) from day to day, and
LINE 18: was incessant in his remembrance of him, but there was likewise no help
LINE 19: for it. Neither is it known after how many days he got over his grief.
LINE 20: On this day, Chia Chen and the others came to tell Chia Cheng that the
LINE 21: works in the garden had all been reported as completed, and that Mr.
LINE 22: Chia She had already inspected them. "It only remains," (they said),
LINE 23: "for you, sir, to see them; and should there possibly be anything which
LINE 24: is not proper, steps will be at once taken to effect the alterations, so
LINE 25: that the tablets and scrolls may conveniently be written."
LINE 26: After Chia Cheng had listened to these words, he pondered for a while.
LINE 27: "These tablets and scrolls," he remarked, "present however a difficult
LINE 28: task. According to the rites, we should, in order to obviate any
LINE 29: shortcoming, request the imperial consort to deign and compose them; but
LINE 30: if the honourable consort does not gaze upon the scenery with her own
LINE 31: eyes, it will also be difficult for her to conceive its nature and
LINE 32: indite upon it! And were we to wait until the arrival of her highness,
LINE 33: to request her to honour the grounds with a visit, before she composes
LINE 34: the inscriptions, such a wide landscape, with so many pavilions and
LINE 35: arbours, will, without one character in the way of a motto, albeit it
LINE 36: may abound with flowers, willows, rockeries, and streams, nevertheless
LINE 37: in no way be able to show off its points of beauty to advantage."
LINE 38: The whole party of family companions, who stood by, smiled. "Your views,
LINE 39: remarkable sir," they ventured, "are excellent; but we have now a
LINE 40: proposal to make. Tablets and scrolls for every locality cannot, on any
LINE 41: account, be dispensed with, but they could not likewise, by any means,
LINE 42: be determined upon for good! Were now, for the time being, two, three or
LINE 43: four characters fixed upon, harmonising with the scenery, to carry out,
LINE 44: for form's sake, the idea, and were they provisionally utilised as
LINE 45: mottoes for the lanterns, tablets and scrolls, and hung up, pending the
LINE 46: arrival of her highness, and her visit through the grounds, when she
LINE 47: could be requested to decide upon the devices, would not two exigencies
LINE 48: be met with satisfactorily?"
LINE 49: "Your views are perfectly correct," observed Chia Cheng, after he had
LINE 50: heard their suggestion; "and we should go to-day and have a look at the
LINE 51: place so as then to set to work to write the inscriptions; which, if
LINE 52: suitable, can readily be used; and, if unsuitable, Yü-ts'un can then be
LINE 53: sent for, and asked to compose fresh ones."
LINE 54: The whole company smiled. "If you, sir, were to compose them to-day,"
LINE 55: they ventured, "they are sure to be excellent; and what need will there
LINE 56: be again to wait for Yü-ts'un!"
LINE 57: "You people are not aware," Chia Cheng added with a smiling countenance,
LINE 58: "that I've been, even in my young days, very mediocre in the composition
LINE 59: of stanzas on flowers, birds, rockeries and streams; and that now that
LINE 60: I'm well up in years and have moreover the fatigue and trouble of my
LINE 61: official duties, I've become in literary compositions like these, which
LINE 62: require a light heart and gladsome mood, still more inapt. Were I even
LINE 63: to succeed in composing any, they will unavoidably be so doltish and
LINE 64: forced that they would contrariwise be instrumental in making the
LINE 65: flowers, trees, garden and pavilions, through their demerits, lose in
LINE 66: beauty, and present instead no pleasing feature."
LINE 67: "This wouldn't anyhow matter," remonstrated all the family companions,
LINE 68: "for after perusing them we can all decide upon them together, each one
LINE 69: of us recommending those he thinks best; which if excellent can be kept,
LINE 70: and if faulty can be discarded; and there's nothing unfeasible about
LINE 71: this!"
LINE 72: "This proposal is most apposite," rejoined Chia Cheng. "What's more, the
LINE 73: weather is, I rejoice, fine to-day; so let's all go in a company and
LINE 74: have a look."
LINE 75: Saying this, he stood up and went forward, at the head of the whole
LINE 76: party; while Chia Chen betook himself in advance into the garden to let
LINE 77: every one know of their coming. As luck would have it, Pao-yü--for he
LINE 78: had been these last few days thinking of Ch'in Chung and so ceaselessly
LINE 79: sad and wounded at heart, that dowager lady Chia had frequently directed
LINE 80: the servants to take him into the new garden to play--made his entrance
LINE 81: just at this very time, and suddenly became aware of the arrival of Chia
LINE 82: Chen, who said to him with a smile, "Don't you yet run away as fast as
LINE 83: you can? Mr. Chia Cheng will be coming in a while."
LINE 84: At these words, Pao-yü led off his nurse and the youths, and rushed at
LINE 85: once out of the garden, like a streak of smoke; but as he turned a
LINE 86: corner, he came face to face with Chia Cheng, who was advancing towards
LINE 87: that direction, at the head of all the visitors; and as he had no time
LINE 88: to get out of the way, the only course open to him was to stand on one
LINE 89: side.
LINE 90: Chia Cheng had, of late, heard the tutor extol him by saying that he
LINE 91: displayed special ability in rhyming antithetical lines, and that
LINE 92: although he did not like to read his books, he nevertheless possessed
LINE 93: some depraved talents, and hence it was that he was induced at this
LINE 94: moment to promptly bid him follow him into the garden, with the intent
LINE 95: of putting him to the test.
LINE 96: Pao-yü could not make out what his object was, but he was compelled to
LINE 97: follow. As soon as they reached the garden gate, and he caught sight of
LINE 98: Chia Chen, standing on one side, along with several managers: "See that
LINE 99: the garden gate is closed for a time," Chia Cheng exclaimed, "for we'll
LINE 100: first see the outside and then go in."
LINE 101: Chia Chen directed a servant to close the gate, and Chia Cheng first
LINE 102: looked straight ahead of him towards the gate and espied on the same
LINE 103: side as the main entrance a suite of five apartments. Above, the
LINE 104: cylindrical tiles resembled the backs of mud eels. The doors, railings,
LINE 105: windows, and frames were all finely carved with designs of the new
LINE 106: fashion, and were painted neither in vermilion nor in white colours. The
LINE 107: whole extent of the walls was of polished bricks of uniform colour;
LINE 108: while below, the white marble on the terrace and steps was engraved with
LINE 109: western foreign designs; and when he came to look to the right and to
LINE 110: the left, everything was white as snow. At the foot of the white-washed
LINE 111: walls, tiger-skin pebbles were, without regard to pattern, promiscuously
LINE 112: inserted in the earth in such a way as of their own selves to form
LINE 113: streaks. Nothing fell in with the custom of gaudiness and display so
LINE 114: much in vogue, so that he naturally felt full of delight; and, when he
LINE 115: forthwith asked that the gate should be thrown open, all that met their
LINE 116: eyes was a long stretch of verdant hills, which shut in the view in
LINE 117: front of them.
LINE 118: "What a fine hill, what a pretty hill!" exclaimed all the companions
LINE 119: with one voice.
LINE 120: "Were it not for this one hill," Chia Cheng explained, "whatever scenery
LINE 121: is contained in it would clearly strike the eye, as soon as one entered
LINE 122: into the garden, and what pleasure would that have been?"
LINE 123: "Quite so," rejoined all of them. "But without large hills and ravines
LINE 124: in one's breast (liberal capacities), how could one attain such
LINE 125: imagination!"
LINE 126: After the conclusion of this remark, they cast a glance ahead of them,
LINE 127: and perceived white rugged rocks looking, either like goblins, or
LINE 128: resembling savage beasts, lying either crossways, or in horizontal or
LINE 129: upright positions; on the surface of which grew moss and lichen with
LINE 130: mottled hues, or parasitic plants, which screened off the light; while,
LINE 131: slightly visible, wound, among the rocks, a narrow pathway like the
LINE 132: intestines of a sheep.
LINE 133: "If we were now to go and stroll along by this narrow path," Chia Cheng
LINE 134: suggested, "and to come out from over there on our return, we shall have
LINE 135: been able to see the whole grounds."
LINE 136: Having finished speaking, he asked Chia Chen to lead the way; and he
LINE 137: himself, leaning on Pao-yü, walked into the gorge with leisurely step.
LINE 138: Raising his head, he suddenly beheld on the hill a block of stone, as
LINE 139: white as the surface of a looking-glass, in a site which was, in very
LINE 140: deed, suitable to be left for an inscription, as it was bound to meet
LINE 141: the eye.
LINE 142: "Gentlemen," Chia Cheng observed, as he turned his head round and
LINE 143: smiled, "please look at this spot. What name will it be fit to give it?"
LINE 144: When the company heard his remark, some maintained that the two words
LINE 145: "Heaped verdure" should be written; and others upheld that the device
LINE 146: should be "Embroidered Hill." Others again suggested: "Vying with the
LINE 147: Hsiang Lu;" and others recommended "the small Chung Nan." And various
LINE 148: kinds of names were proposed, which did not fall short of several tens.
LINE 149: All the visitors had been, it must be explained, aware at an early
LINE 150: period of the fact that Chia Cheng meant to put Pao-yü's ability to the
LINE 151: test, and for this reason they merely proposed a few combinations in
LINE 152: common use. But of this intention, Pao-yü himself was likewise
LINE 153: cognizant.
LINE 154: After listening to the suggestions, Chia Cheng forthwith turned his head
LINE 155: round and bade Pao-yü think of some motto.
LINE 156: "I've often heard," Pao-yü replied, "that writers of old opine that it's
LINE 157: better to quote an old saying than to compose a new one; and that an old
LINE 158: engraving excels in every respect an engraving of the present day.
LINE 159: What's more, this place doesn't constitute the main hill or the chief
LINE 160: feature of the scenery, and is really no site where any inscription
LINE 161: should be put, as it no more than constitutes the first step in the
LINE 162: inspection of the landscape. Won't it be well to employ the exact text
LINE 163: of an old writer consisting of 'a tortuous path leading to a secluded
LINE 164: (nook).' This line of past days would, if inscribed, be, in fact,
LINE 165: liberal to boot."
LINE 166: After listening to the proposed line, they all sang its praise.
LINE 167: "First-rate! excellent!" they cried, "the natural talents of your second
LINE 168: son, dear friend, are lofty; his mental capacity is astute; he is unlike
LINE 169: ourselves, who have read books but are simple fools."
LINE 170: "You shouldn't," urged Chia Cheng smilingly, "heap upon him excessive
LINE 171: praise; he's young in years, and merely knows one thing which he turns
LINE 172: to the use of ten purposes; you should laugh at him, that's all; but we
LINE 173: can by and by choose some device."
LINE 174: As he spoke, he entered the cave, where he perceived beautiful trees
LINE 175: with thick foliage, quaint flowers in lustrous bloom, while a line of
LINE 176: limpid stream emanated out of a deep recess among the flowers and trees,
LINE 177: and oozed down through the crevice of the rock. Progressing several
LINE 178: steps further in, they gradually faced the northern side, where a
LINE 179: stretch of level ground extended far and wide, on each side of which
LINE 180: soared lofty buildings, intruding themselves into the skies, whose
LINE 181: carved rafters and engraved balustrades nestled entirely among the
LINE 182: depressions of the hills and the tops of the trees. They lowered their
LINE 183: eyes and looked, and beheld a pure stream flowing like jade, stone steps
LINE 184: traversing the clouds, a balustrade of white marble encircling the pond
LINE 185: in its embrace, and a stone bridge with three archways, the animals upon
LINE 186: which had faces disgorging water from their mouths. A pavilion stood on
LINE 187: the bridge, and in this pavilion Chia Chen and the whole party went and
LINE 188: sat.
LINE 189: "Gentlemen," he inquired, "what shall we write about this?"
LINE 190: "In the record," they all replied, "of the 'Drunken Old Man's Pavilion,'
LINE 191: written in days of old by Ou Yang, appears this line: 'There is a
LINE 192: pavilion pinioned-like,' so let us call this 'the pinioned-like
LINE 193: pavilion,' and finish."
LINE 194: "Pinioned-like," observed Chia Cheng smiling, "is indeed excellent; but
LINE 195: this pavilion is constructed over the water, and there should, after
LINE 196: all, be some allusion to the water in the designation. My humble opinion
LINE 197: is that of the line in Ou Yang's work, '(the water) drips from between
LINE 198: the two peaks,' we should only make use of that single word 'drips.'"
LINE 199: "First-rate!" rejoined one of the visitors, "capital! but what would
LINE 200: really be appropriate are the two characters 'dripping jadelike.'"
LINE 201: Chia Chen pulled at his moustache, as he gave way to reflection; after
LINE 202: which, he asked Pao-yü to also propose one himself.
LINE 203: "What you, sir, suggested a while back," replied Pao-yü, "will do very
LINE 204: well; but if we were now to sift the matter thoroughly, the use of the
LINE 205: single word 'drip' by Ou Yang, in his composition about the Niang
LINE 206: spring, would appear quite apposite; while the application, also on this
LINE 207: occasion, to this spring, of the character 'drip' would be found not
LINE 208: quite suitable. Moreover, seeing that this place is intended as a
LINE 209: separate residence (for the imperial consort), on her visit to her
LINE 210: parents, it is likewise imperative that we should comply with all the
LINE 211: principles of etiquette, so that were words of this kind to be used,
LINE 212: they would besides be coarse and inappropriate; and may it please you to
LINE 213: fix upon something else more recondite and abstruse."
LINE 214: "What do you, gentlemen, think of this argument?" Chia Cheng remarked
LINE 215: sneeringly. "A little while ago, when the whole company devised
LINE 216: something original, you observed that it would be better to quote an old
LINE 217: device; and now that we have quoted an old motto, you again maintain
LINE 218: that it's coarse and inappropriate! But you had better give us one of
LINE 219: yours."
LINE 220: "If two characters like 'dripping jadelike' are to be used," Pao-yü
LINE 221: explained, "it would be better then to employ the two words 'Penetrating
LINE 222: Fragrance,' which would be unique and excellent, wouldn't they?"
LINE 223: Chia Cheng pulled his moustache, nodded his head and did not utter a
LINE 224: word; whereupon the whole party hastily pressed forward with one voice
LINE 225: to eulogize Pao-yü's acquirements as extraordinary.
LINE 226: "The selection of two characters for the tablet is an easy matter,"
LINE 227: suggested Chia Cheng, "but now go on and compose a pair of antithetical
LINE 228: phrases with seven words in each."
LINE 229: Pao-yü cast a glance round the four quarters, when an idea came into his
LINE 230: head, and he went on to recite:
LINE 231: The willows, which enclose the shore, the green borrow from three
LINE 232: bamboos;
LINE 233: On banks apart, the flowers asunder grow, yet one perfume they give.
LINE 234: Upon hearing these lines, Chia Cheng gave a faint smile, as he nodded
LINE 235: his head, whilst the whole party went on again to be effusive in their
LINE 236: praise. But forthwith they issued from the pavilions, and crossed the
LINE 237: pond, contemplating with close attention each elevation, each stone,
LINE 238: each flower, or each tree. And as suddenly they raised their heads, they
LINE 239: caught sight, in front of them, of a line of white wall, of numbers of
LINE 240: columns, and beautiful cottages, where flourished hundreds and thousands
LINE 241: of verdant bamboos, which screened off the rays of the sun.
LINE 242: "What a lovely place!" they one and all exclaimed.
LINE 243: Speedily the whole company penetrated inside, perceiving, as soon as
LINE 244: they had entered the gate, a zigzag arcade, below the steps of which was
LINE 245: a raised pathway, laid promiscuously with stones, and on the furthest
LINE 246: part stood a diminutive cottage with three rooms, two with doors leading
LINE 247: into them and one without. Everything in the interior, in the shape of
LINE 248: beds, teapoys, chairs and tables, were made to harmonise with the space
LINE 249: available. Leading out of the inner room of the cottage was a small door
LINE 250: from which, as they egressed, they found a back-court with lofty pear
LINE 251: trees in blossom and banana trees, as well as two very small retiring
LINE 252: back-courts. At the foot of the wall, unexpectedly became visible an
LINE 253: aperture where was a spring, for which a channel had been opened
LINE 254: scarcely a foot or so wide, to enable it to run inside the wall. Winding
LINE 255: round the steps, it skirted the buildings until it reached the front
LINE 256: court, where it coiled and curved, flowing out under the bamboos.
LINE 257: "This spot," observed Chia Cheng full of smiles, "is indeed pleasant!
LINE 258: and could one, on a moonlight night, sit under the window and study, one
LINE 259: would not spend a whole lifetime in vain!"
LINE 260: As he said this, he quickly cast a glance at Pao-yü, and so terrified
LINE 261: did Pao-yü feel that he hastily drooped his head. The whole company lost
LINE 262: no time in choosing some irrelevant talk to turn the conversation, and
LINE 263: two of the visitors prosecuted their remarks by adding that on the
LINE 264: tablet, in this spot, four characters should be inscribed.
LINE 265: "Which four characters?" Chia Cheng inquired, laughingly.
LINE 266: "The bequeathed aspect of the river Ch'i!" suggested one of them.
LINE 267: "It's commonplace," observed Chia Cheng.
LINE 268: Another person recommended "the remaining vestiges of the Chü Garden."
LINE 269: "This too is commonplace!" replied Chia Cheng.
LINE 270: "Let brother Pao-yü again propound one!" interposed Chia Chen, who stood
LINE 271: by.
LINE 272: "Before he composes any himself," Chia Cheng continued, "his wont is to
LINE 273: first discuss the pros and cons of those of others; so it's evident that
LINE 274: he's an impudent fellow!"
LINE 275: "He's most reasonable in his arguments," all the visitors protested,
LINE 276: "and why should he be called to task?"
LINE 277: "Don't humour him so much!" Chia Cheng expostulated. "I'll put up for
LINE 278: to-day," he however felt constrained to tell Pao-yü, "with your haughty
LINE 279: manner, and your rubbishy speech, so that after you have, to begin with,
LINE 280: given us your opinion, you may next compose a device. But tell me, are
LINE 281: there any that will do among the mottoes suggested just now by all the
LINE 282: gentlemen?"
LINE 283: "They all seem to me unsuitable!" Pao-yü did not hesitate to say by way
LINE 284: of reply to this question.
LINE 285: Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. "How all unsuitable?" he exclaimed.
LINE 286: "This," continued Pao-yü, "is the first spot which her highness will
LINE 287: honour on her way, and there should be inscribed, so that it should be
LINE 288: appropriate, something commending her sacred majesty. But if a tablet
LINE 289: with four characters has to be used, there are likewise devices ready at
LINE 290: hand, written by poets of old; and what need is there to compose any
LINE 291: more?"
LINE 292: "Are forsooth the devices 'the river Ch'i and the Chu Garden' not those
LINE 293: of old authors?" insinuated Chia Cheng.
LINE 294: "They are too stiff," replied Pao-yü. "Would not the four characters: 'a
LINE 295: phoenix comes with dignified air,' be better?"
LINE 296: With clamorous unanimity the whole party shouted: "Excellent:" and Chia
LINE 297: Cheng nodding his head; "You beast, you beast!" he ejaculated, "it may
LINE 298: well be said about you that you see through a thin tube and have no more
LINE 299: judgment than an insect! Compose another stanza," he consequently bade
LINE 300: him; and Pao-yü recited:
LINE 301: In the precious tripod kettle, tea is brewed, but green is still the
LINE 302: smoke!
LINE 303: O'er is the game of chess by the still window, but the fingers are yet
LINE 304: cold.
LINE 305: Chia Cheng shook his head. "Neither does this seem to me good!" he said;
LINE 306: and having concluded this remark he was leading the company out, when
LINE 307: just as he was about to proceed, he suddenly bethought himself of
LINE 308: something.
LINE 309: "The several courts and buildings and the teapoys, sideboards, tables
LINE 310: and chairs," he added, "may be said to be provided for. But there are
LINE 311: still all those curtains, screens and portieres, as well as the
LINE 312: furniture, nicknacks and curios; and have they too all been matched to
LINE 313: suit the requirements of each place?"
LINE 314: "Of the things that have to be placed about," Chia Chen explained, a
LINE 315: good number have, at an early period, been added, and of course when the
LINE 316: time comes everything will be suitably arranged. As for the curtains,
LINE 317: screens, and portieres, which have to be hung up, I heard yesterday
LINE 318: brother Lien say that they are not as yet complete, that when the works
LINE 319: were first taken in hand, the plan of each place was drawn, the
LINE 320: measurements accurately calculated and some one despatched to attend to
LINE 321: the things, and that he thought that yesterday half of them were bound
LINE 322: to come in.
LINE 323: Chia Cheng, upon hearing this explanation, readily remembered that with
LINE 324: all these concerns Chia Chen had nothing to do; so that he speedily sent
LINE 325: some one to go and call Chia Lien.
LINE 326: Having arrived in a short while, "How many sorts of things are there in
LINE 327: all?" Chia Cheng inquired of him. "Of these how many kinds have by this
LINE 328: time been got ready? and how many more are short?"
LINE 329: At this question, Chia Lien hastily produced, from the flaps of his
LINE 330: boot, a paper pocket-book, containing a list, which he kept inside the
LINE 331: tops of his boot. After perusing it and reperusing it, he made suitable
LINE 332: reply. "Of the hundred and twenty curtains," he proceeded, "of stiff
LINE 333: spotted silks, embroidered with dragons in relief, and of the curtains
LINE 334: large and small, of every kind of damask silk, eighty were got
LINE 335: yesterday, so that there still remain forty of them to come. The two
LINE 336: portieres were both received yesterday; and besides these, there are the
LINE 337: two hundred red woollen portieres, two hundred portieres of Hsiang Fei
LINE 338: bamboo; two hundred door-screens of rattan, with gold streaks, and of
LINE 339: red lacquered bamboo; two hundred portieres of black lacquered rattan;
LINE 340: two hundred door-screens of variegated thread-netting with clusters of
LINE 341: flowers. Of each of these kinds, half have come in, but the whole lot of
LINE 342: them will be complete no later than autumn. Antimacassars, table-cloths,
LINE 343: flounces for the beds, and cushions for the stools, there are a thousand
LINE 344: two hundred of each, but these likewise are ready and at hand."
LINE 345: As he spoke, they proceeded outwards, but suddenly they perceived a hill
LINE 346: extending obliquely in such a way as to intercept the passage; and as
LINE 347: they wound round the curve of the hill faintly came to view a line of
LINE 348: yellow mud walls, the whole length of which was covered with paddy
LINE 349: stalks for the sake of protection, and there were several hundreds of
LINE 350: apricot trees in bloom, which presented the appearance of being fire,
LINE 351: spurted from the mouth, or russet clouds, rising in the air. Inside this
LINE 352: enclosure, stood several thatched cottages. Outside grew, on the other
LINE 353: hand, mulberry trees, elms, mallows, and silkworm oaks, whose tender
LINE 354: shoots and new twigs, of every hue, were allowed to bend and to
LINE 355: intertwine in such a way as to form two rows of green fence. Beyond this
LINE 356: fence and below the white mound, was a well, by the side of which stood
LINE 357: a well-sweep, windlass and such like articles; the ground further down
LINE 358: being divided into parcels, and apportioned into fields, which, with the
LINE 359: fine vegetables and cabbages in flower, presented, at the first glance,
LINE 360: the aspect of being illimitable.
LINE 361: "This is," Chia Cheng observed chuckling, "the place really imbued with
LINE 362: a certain amount of the right principle; and laid out, though it has
LINE 363: been by human labour, yet when it strikes my eye, it so moves my heart,
LINE 364: that it cannot help arousing in me the wish to return to my native place
LINE 365: and become a farmer. But let us enter and rest a while."
LINE 366: As he concluded these words, they were on the point of walking in, when
LINE 367: they unexpectedly discerned a stone, outside the trellis gate, by the
LINE 368: roadside, which had also been left as a place on which to inscribe a
LINE 369: motto.
LINE 370: "Were a tablet," argued the whole company smilingly, "put up high in a
LINE 371: spot like this, to be filled up by and by, the rustic aspect of a farm
LINE 372: would in that case be completely done away with; and it will be better,
LINE 373: yea far better to erect this slab on the ground, as it will further make
LINE 374: manifest many points of beauty. But unless a motto could be composed of
LINE 375: the same excellence as that in Fan Shih-hu's song on farms, it will not
LINE 376: be adequate to express its charms!"
LINE 377: "Gentlemen," observed Chia Cheng, "please suggest something."
LINE 378: "A short while back," replied the whole company, "your son, venerable
LINE 379: brother, remarked that devising a new motto was not equal to quoting an
LINE 380: old one, and as sites of this kind have been already exhausted by
LINE 381: writers of days of old, wouldn't it be as well that we should
LINE 382: straightway call it the 'apricot blossom village?' and this will do
LINE 383: splendidly."
LINE 384: When Chia Cheng heard this remark, he smiled and said, addressing
LINE 385: himself to Chia Chen: "This just reminds me that although this place is
LINE 386: perfect in every respect, there's still one thing wanting in the shape
LINE 387: of a wine board; and you had better then have one made to-morrow on the
LINE 388: very same pattern as those used outside in villages; and it needn't be
LINE 389: anything gaudy, but hung above the top of a tree by means of bamboos."
LINE 390: Chia Chen assented. "There's no necessity," he went on to explain, "to
LINE 391: keep any other birds in here, but only to rear a few geese, ducks, fowls
LINE 392: and such like; as in that case they will be in perfect keeping with the
LINE 393: place."
LINE 394: "A splendid idea!" Chia Cheng rejoined, along with all the party.
LINE 395: "'Apricot blossom village' is really first-rate," continued Chia Cheng
LINE 396: as he again addressed himself to the company; "but the only thing is
LINE 397: that it encroaches on the real designation of the village; and it will
LINE 398: be as well to wait (until her highness comes), when we can request her
LINE 399: to give it a name."
LINE 400: "Certainly!" answered the visitors with one voice; "but now as far as a
LINE 401: name goes, for mere form, let us all consider what expressions will be
LINE 402: suitable to employ."
LINE 403: Pao-yü did not however give them time to think; nor did he wait for Chia
LINE 404: Cheng's permission, but suggested there and then: "In old poetical works
LINE 405: there's this passage: 'At the top of the red apricot tree hangs the flag
LINE 406: of an inn,' and wouldn't it be advisable, on this occasion, to
LINE 407: temporarily adopt the four words: 'the sign on the apricot tree is
LINE 408: visible'?"
LINE 409: "'Is visible' is excellent," suggested the whole number of them, "and
LINE 410: what's more it secretly accords with the meaning implied by 'apricot
LINE 411: blossom village.'"
LINE 412: "Were the two words 'apricot blossom' used for the name of the village,
LINE 413: they would be too commonplace and unsuitable;" added Pao-yü with a
LINE 414: sardonic grin, "but there's another passage in the works of a poet of
LINE 415: the T'ang era: 'By the wooden gate near the water the corn-flower emits
LINE 416: its fragrance;' and why not make use of the motto 'corn fragrance
LINE 417: village,' which will be excellent?"
LINE 418: When the company heard his proposal, they, with still greater vigour,
LINE 419: unanimously combined in crying out "Capital!" as they clapped their
LINE 420: hands.
LINE 421: Chia Cheng, with one shout, interrupted their cries, "You ignorant child
LINE 422: of wrath!" he ejaculated; "how many old writers can you know, and how
LINE 423: many stanzas of ancient poetical works can you remember, that you will
LINE 424: have the boldness to show off in the presence of all these experienced
LINE 425: gentlemen? (In allowing you to give vent to) all the nonsense you
LINE 426: uttered my object was no other than to see whether your brain was clear
LINE 427: or muddled; and all for fun's sake, that's all; and lo, you've taken
LINE 428: things in real earnest!"
LINE 429: Saying this, he led the company into the interior of the hall with the
LINE 430: mallows. The windows were pasted with paper, and the bedsteads made of
LINE 431: wood, and all appearance of finery had been expunged, and Chia Cheng's
LINE 432: heart was naturally much gratified; but nevertheless, scowling angrily
LINE 433: at Pao-yü, "What do you think of this place?" he asked.
LINE 434: When the party heard this question, they all hastened to stealthily give
LINE 435: a nudge to Pao-yü, with the express purpose of inducing him to say it
LINE 436: was nice; but Pao-yü gave no ear to what they all urged. "It's by far
LINE 437: below the spot," he readily replied, "designated 'a phoenix comes with
LINE 438: dignified air.'"
LINE 439: "You ignorant stupid thing!" exclaimed Chia Cheng at these words; "what
LINE 440: you simply fancy as exquisite, with that despicable reliance of yours
LINE 441: upon luxury and display, are two-storied buildings and painted pillars!
LINE 442: But how can you know anything about this aspect so pure and unobtrusive,
LINE 443: and this is all because of that failing of not studying your books!"
LINE 444: "Sir," hastily answered Pao-yü, "your injunctions are certainly correct;
LINE 445: but men of old have often made allusion to 'natural;' and what is, I
LINE 446: wonder, the import of these two characters?"
LINE 447: The company had perceived what a perverse mind Pao yü possessed, and
LINE 448: they one and all were much surprised that he should be so silly beyond
LINE 449: the possibility of any change; and when now they heard the question he
LINE 450: asked, about the two characters representing "natural," they, with one
LINE 451: accord, speedily remarked, "Everything else you understand, and how is
LINE 452: it that on the contrary you don't know what 'natural' implies? The word
LINE 453: 'natural' means effected by heaven itself and not made by human labour."
LINE 454: "Well, just so," rejoined Pao-yü; "but the farm, which is laid out in
LINE 455: this locality, is distinctly the handiwork of human labour; in the
LINE 456: distance, there are no neighbouring hamlets; near it, adjoin no wastes;
LINE 457: though it bears a hill, the hill is destitute of streaks; though it be
LINE 458: close to water, this water has no spring; above, there is no pagoda
LINE 459: nestling in a temple; below, there is no bridge leading to a market; it
LINE 460: rises abrupt and solitary, and presents no grand sight! The palm would
LINE 461: seem to be carried by the former spot, which is imbued with the natural
LINE 462: principle, and possesses the charms of nature; for, though bamboos have
LINE 463: been planted in it, and streams introduced, they nevertheless do no
LINE 464: violence to the works executed. 'A natural landscape,' says, an ancient
LINE 465: author in four words; and why? Simply because he apprehended that what
LINE 466: was not land, would, by forcible ways, be converted into land; and that
LINE 467: what was no hill would, by unnatural means, be raised into a hill. And
LINE 468: ingenious though these works might be in a hundred and one ways, they
LINE 469: cannot, after all, be in harmony."...
LINE 470: But he had no time to conclude, as Chia Cheng flew into a rage. "Drive
LINE 471: him off," he shouted; (but as Pao-yü) was on the point of going out, he
LINE 472: again cried out: "Come back! make up," he added, "another couplet, and
LINE 473: if it isn't clear, I'll for all this give you a slap on your mouth."
LINE 474: Pao-yü had no alternative but to recite as follows:
LINE 475: A spot in which the "Ko" fibre to bleach, as the fresh tide doth swell
LINE 476: the waters green!
LINE 477: A beauteous halo and a fragrant smell the man encompass who the cress
LINE 478: did pluck!
LINE 479: Chia Cheng, after this recital, nodded his head. "This is still worse!"
LINE 480: he remarked, but as he reproved him, he led the company outside, and
LINE 481: winding past the mound, they penetrated among flowers, and wending their
LINE 482: steps by the willows, they touched the rocks and lingered by the stream.
LINE 483: Passing under the trellis with yellow roses, they went into the shed
LINE 484: with white roses; they crossed by the pavilion with peonies, and walked
LINE 485: through the garden, where the white peony grew; and entering the court
LINE 486: with the cinnamon roses, they reached the island of bananas. As they
LINE 487: meandered and zigzagged, suddenly they heard the rustling sound of the
LINE 488: water, as it came out from a stone cave, from the top of which grew
LINE 489: parasitic plants drooping downwards, while at its bottom floated the
LINE 490: fallen flowers.
LINE 491: "What a fine sight!" they all exclaimed; "what beautiful scenery!"
LINE 492: "Gentlemen," observed Chia Cheng, "what name do you propose for this
LINE 493: place?"
LINE 494: "There's no further need for deliberation," the company rejoined; "for
LINE 495: this is just the very spot fit for the three words 'Wu Ling Spring.'"
LINE 496: "This too is matter-of-fact!" Chia Cheng objected laughingly, "and
LINE 497: likewise antiquated."
LINE 498: "If that won't do," the party smiled, "well then what about the four
LINE 499: characters implying 'An old cottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty?'"
LINE 500: "This is still more exceedingly plain!" interposed Pao-yü. "'The old
LINE 501: cottage of a man of the Ch'in dynasty' is meant to imply a retreat from
LINE 502: revolution, and how will it suit this place? Wouldn't the four
LINE 503: characters be better denoting 'an isthmus with smart weed, and a stream
LINE 504: with flowers'?"
LINE 505: When Chia Cheng heard these words, he exclaimed: "You're talking still
LINE 506: more stuff and nonsense?" and forthwith entering the grotto, Chia Cheng
LINE 507: went on to ask of Chia Chen, "Are there any boats or not?"
LINE 508: "There are to be," replied Chia Chen, "four boats in all from which to
LINE 509: pick the lotus, and one boat for sitting in; but they haven't now as yet
LINE 510: been completed."
LINE 511: "What a pity!" Chia Cheng answered smilingly, "that we cannot go in."
LINE 512: "But we could also get into it by the tortuous path up the hill," Chia
LINE 513: Chen ventured; and after finishing this remark, he walked ahead to show
LINE 514: the way, and the whole party went over, holding on to the creepers, and
LINE 515: supporting themselves by the trees, when they saw a still larger
LINE 516: quantity of fallen leaves on the surface of the water, and the stream
LINE 517: itself, still more limpid, gently and idly meandering along on its
LINE 518: circuitous course. By the bank of the pond were two rows of weeping
LINE 519: willows, which, intermingling with peach and apricot trees, screened the
LINE 520: heavens from view, and kept off the rays of the sun from this spot,
LINE 521: which was in real truth devoid of even a grain of dust.
LINE 522: Suddenly, they espied in the shade of the willows, an arched wooden
LINE 523: bridge also reveal itself to the eye, with bannisters of vermilion
LINE 524: colour. They crossed the bridge, and lo, all the paths lay open before
LINE 525: them; but their gaze was readily attracted by a brick cottage spotless
LINE 526: and cool-looking; whose walls were constructed of polished bricks, of
LINE 527: uniform colour; (whose roof was laid) with speckless tiles; and whose
LINE 528: enclosing walls were painted; while the minor slopes, which branched off
LINE 529: from the main hill, all passed along under the walls on to the other
LINE 530: side.
LINE 531: "This house, in a site like this, is perfectly destitute of any charm!"
LINE 532: added Chia Cheng.
LINE 533: And as they entered the door, abruptly appeared facing them, a large
LINE 534: boulder studded with holes and soaring high in the skies, which was
LINE 535: surrounded on all four sides by rocks of every description, and
LINE 536: completely, in fact, hid from view the rooms situated in the compound.
LINE 537: But of flowers or trees, there was not even one about; and all that was
LINE 538: visible were a few strange kinds of vegetation; some being of the
LINE 539: creeper genus, others parasitic plants, either hanging from the apex of
LINE 540: the hill, or inserting themselves into the base of the rocks; drooping
LINE 541: down even from the eaves of the house, entwining the pillars, and
LINE 542: closing round the stone steps. Or like green bands, they waved and
LINE 543: flapped; or like gold thread, they coiled and bent, either with seeds
LINE 544: resembling cinnabar, or with blossoms like golden olea; whose fragrance
LINE 545: and aroma could not be equalled by those emitted by flowers of ordinary
LINE 546: species.
LINE 547: "This is pleasant!" Chia Cheng could not refrain from saying; "the only
LINE 548: thing is that I don't know very much about flowers."
LINE 549: "What are here are lianas and ficus pumila!" some of the company
LINE 550: observed.
LINE 551: "How ever can the liana and the ficus have such unusual scent?"
LINE 552: questioned Chia Cheng.
LINE 553: "Indeed they aren't!" interposed Pao-yü. "Among all these flowers, there
LINE 554: are also ficus and liana, but those scented ones are iris, ligularia,
LINE 555: and 'Wu' flowers; that kind consist, for the most part, of 'Ch'ih'
LINE 556: flowers and orchids; while this mostly of gold-coloured dolichos. That
LINE 557: species is the hypericum plant, this the 'Yü Lu' creeper. The red ones
LINE 558: are, of course, the purple rue; the green ones consist for certain, of
LINE 559: the green 'Chih' plant; and, to the best of my belief, these various
LINE 560: plants are mentioned in the 'Li Sao' and 'Wen Hsuan.' These rare plants
LINE 561: are, some of them called something or other like 'Huo Na' and 'Chiang
LINE 562: Hui;' others again are designated something like 'Lun Tsu' and 'Tz'u
LINE 563: Feng;' while others there are whose names sound like 'Shih Fan,' 'Shui
LINE 564: Sung' and 'Fu Liu,' which together with other species are to be found in
LINE 565: the 'Treatise about the Wu city' by Tso T'ai-chung. There are also those
LINE 566: which go under the appellation of 'Lu T'i,' or something like that;
LINE 567: while there are others that are called something or other like 'Tan
LINE 568: Chiao,' 'Mi Wu' and 'Feng Lien;' reference to which is made in the
LINE 569: 'Treatise on the Shu city.' But so many years have now elapsed, and the
LINE 570: times have so changed (since these treatises were written), that people,
LINE 571: being unable to discriminate (the real names) may consequently have had
LINE 572: to appropriate in every case such names as suited the external aspect,
LINE 573: so that they may, it is quite possible, have gradually come to be called
LINE 574: by wrong designations."
LINE 575: But he had no time to conclude; for Chia Cheng interrupted him. "Who has
LINE 576: ever asked you about it?" he shouted; which plunged Pao-yü into such a
LINE 577: fright, that he drew back, and did not venture to utter another word.
LINE 578: Chia Cheng perceiving that on both sides alike were covered passages
LINE 579: resembling outstretched arms, forthwith continued his steps and entered
LINE 580: the covered way, when he caught sight, at the upper end, of a
LINE 581: five-roomed building, without spot or blemish, with folding blinds
LINE 582: extending in a connected line, and with corridors on all four sides; (a
LINE 583: building) which with its windows so green, and its painted walls,
LINE 584: excelled, in spotless elegance, the other buildings they had seen
LINE 585: before, to which it presented such a contrast.
LINE 586: Chia Cheng heaved a sigh. "If one were able," he observed, "to boil his
LINE 587: tea and thrum his lyre in here, there wouldn't even be any need for him
LINE 588: to burn any more incense. But the execution of this structure is so
LINE 589: beyond conception that you must, gentlemen, compose something nice and
LINE 590: original to embellish the tablet with, so as not to render such a place
LINE 591: of no effect!"
LINE 592: "There's nothing so really pat," suggested the company smiling; "as 'the
LINE 593: orchid-smell-laden breeze' and 'the dew-bedecked epidendrum!"
LINE 594: "These are indeed the only four characters," rejoined Chia Cheng, "that
LINE 595: could be suitably used; but what's to be said as far as the scroll
LINE 596: goes?"
LINE 597: "I've thought of a couplet," interposed one of the party, "which you'll
LINE 598: all have to criticise, and put into ship-shape; its burden is this:
LINE 599: "The musk-like epidendrum smell enshrouds the court, where shines the
LINE 600: sun with oblique beams;
LINE 601: The iris fragrance is wafted over the isle illumined by the moon's
LINE 602: clear rays."
LINE 603: "As far as excellence is concerned, it's excellent," observed the whole
LINE 604: party, "but the two words representing 'with oblique beams' are not
LINE 605: felicitous."
LINE 606: And as some one quoted the line from an old poem:
LINE 607: The angelica fills the court with tears, what time the sun doth slant.
LINE 608: "Lugubrious, lugubrious!" expostulated the company with one voice.
LINE 609: Another person then interposed. "I also have a couplet, whose merits
LINE 610: you, gentlemen, can weigh; it runs as follows:
LINE 611: "Along the three pathways doth float the Yü Hui scented breeze!
LINE 612: The radiant moon in the whole hall shines on the gold orchid!"
LINE 613: Chia Cheng tugged at his moustache and gave way to meditation. He was
LINE 614: just about also to suggest a stanza, when, upon suddenly raising his
LINE 615: head, he espied Pao-yü standing by his side, too timid to give vent to a
LINE 616: single sound.
LINE 617: "How is it," he purposely exclaimed, "that when you should speak, you
LINE 618: contrariwise don't? Is it likely that you expect some one to request you
LINE 619: to confer upon us the favour of your instruction?"
LINE 620: "In this place," Pao-yü rejoined at these words, "there are no such
LINE 621: things as orchids, musk, resplendent moon or islands; and were one to
LINE 622: begin quoting such specimens of allusions, to scenery, two hundred
LINE 623: couplets could be readily given without, even then, having been able to
LINE 624: exhaust the supply!"
LINE 625: "Who presses your head down," Chia Cheng urged, "and uses force that you
LINE 626: must come out with all these remarks?"
LINE 627: "Well, in that case," added Pao-yü, "there are no fitter words to put on
LINE 628: the tablet than the four representing: 'The fragrance pure of the
LINE 629: ligularia and iris.' While the device on the scroll might be:
LINE 630: "Sung is the nutmeg song, but beauteous still is the sonnet!
LINE 631: Near the T'u Mei to sleep, makes e'en a dream with fragrance full!"
LINE 632: "This is," laughed Chia Cheng sneeringly, "an imitation of the line:
LINE 633: "A book when it is made of plaintain leaves, the writing green is also
LINE 634: bound to be!
LINE 635: "So that there's nothing remarkable about it."
LINE 636: "Li T'ai-po, in his work on the Phoenix Terrace," protested the whole
LINE 637: party, "copied, in every point, the Huang Hua Lou. But what's essential
LINE 638: is a faultless imitation. Now were we to begin to criticise minutely the
LINE 639: couplet just cited, we would indeed find it to be, as compared with the
LINE 640: line 'A book when it is made of plantain leaves,' still more elegant and
LINE 641: of wider application!"
LINE 642: "What an idea?" observed Chia Cheng derisively.
LINE 643: But as he spoke, the whole party walked out; but they had not gone very
LINE 644: far before they caught sight of a majestic summer house, towering high
LINE 645: peak-like, and of a structure rising loftily with storey upon storey;
LINE 646: and completely locked in as they were on every side they were as
LINE 647: beautiful as the Jade palace. Far and wide, road upon road coiled and
LINE 648: wound; while the green pines swept the eaves, the jady epidendrum
LINE 649: encompassed the steps, the animals' faces glistened like gold, and the
LINE 650: dragons' heads shone resplendent in their variegated hues.
LINE 651: "This is the Main Hall," remarked Chia Cheng; "the only word against it
LINE 652: is that there's a little too much finery."
LINE 653: "It should be so," rejoined one and all, "so as to be what it's intended
LINE 654: to be! The imperial consort has, it is true, an exalted preference for
LINE 655: economy and frugality, but her present honourable position requires the
LINE 656: observance of such courtesies, so that (finery) is no fault."
LINE 657: As they made these remarks and advanced on their way the while, they
LINE 658: perceived, just in front of them, an archway project to view,
LINE 659: constructed of jadelike stone; at the top of which the coils of large
LINE 660: dragons and the scales of small dragons were executed in perforated
LINE 661: style.
LINE 662: "What's the device to be for this spot?" inquired Chia Cheng.
LINE 663: "It should be 'fairy land,'" suggested all of them, "so as to be
LINE 664: apposite!"
LINE 665: Chia Cheng nodded his head and said nothing. But as soon as Pao-yü
LINE 666: caught sight of this spot something was suddenly aroused in his heart
LINE 667: and he began to ponder within himself. "This place really resembles
LINE 668: something that I've seen somewhere or other." But he could not at the
LINE 669: moment recall to mind what year, moon, or day this had happened.
LINE 670: Chia Cheng bade him again propose a motto; but Pao-yü was bent upon
LINE 671: thinking over the details of the scenery he had seen on a former
LINE 672: occasion, and gave no thought whatever to this place, so that the whole
LINE 673: company were at a loss what construction to give to his silence, and
LINE 674: came simply to the conclusion that, after the bullying he had had to put
LINE 675: up with for ever so long, his spirits had completely vanished, his
LINE 676: talents become exhausted and his speech impoverished; and that if he
LINE 677: were harassed and pressed, he might perchance, as the result of anxiety,
LINE 678: contract some ailment or other, which would of course not be a suitable
LINE 679: issue, and they lost no time in combining together to dissuade Chia
LINE 680: Cheng.
LINE 681: "Never mind," they said, "to-morrow will do to compose some device;
LINE 682: let's drop it now."
LINE 683: Chia Cheng himself was inwardly afraid lest dowager lady Chia should be
LINE 684: anxious, so that he hastily remarked as he forced a smile. "You beast,
LINE 685: there are, after all, also occasions on which you are no good! but never
LINE 686: mind! I'll give you one day to do it in, and if by to-morrow you haven't
LINE 687: been able to compose anything, I shall certainly not let you off. This
LINE 688: is the first and foremost place and you must exercise due care in what
LINE 689: you write."
LINE 690: Saying this, he sallied out, at the head of the company, and cast
LINE 691: another glance at the scenery.
LINE 692: Indeed from the time they had entered the gate up to this stage, they
LINE 693: had just gone over five or six tenths of the whole ground, when it
LINE 694: happened again that a servant came and reported that some one had
LINE 695: arrived from Mr. Yü-'ts'un's to deliver a message. "These several places
LINE 696: (which remain)," Chia Cheng observed with a smile, "we have no time to
LINE 697: pass under inspection; but we might as well nevertheless go out at least
LINE 698: by that way, as we shall be able, to a certain degree, to have a look at
LINE 699: the general aspect."
LINE 700: With these words, he showed the way for the family companions until they
LINE 701: reached a large bridge, with water entering under it, looking like a
LINE 702: curtain made of crystal. This bridge, the fact is, was the dam, which
LINE 703: communicated with the river outside, and from which the stream was
LINE 704: introduced into the grounds.
LINE 705: "What's the name of this water-gate?" Chia Cheng inquired.
LINE 706: "This is," replied Pao-yü, "the main stream of the Hsin Fang river, and
LINE 707: is therefore called the Hsin Fang water-gate."
LINE 708: "Nonsense!" exclaimed Chia Cheng. "The two words Hsin Fang must on no
LINE 709: account be used!"
LINE 710: And as they speedily advanced on their way, they either came across
LINE 711: elegant halls, or thatched cottages; walls made of piled-up stone, or
LINE 712: gates fashioned of twisted plants; either a secluded nunnery or Buddhist
LINE 713: fane, at the foot of some hill; or some unsullied houses, hidden in a
LINE 714: grove, tenanted by rationalistic priestesses; either extensive corridors
LINE 715: and winding grottoes; or square buildings, and circular pavilions. But
LINE 716: Chia Cheng had not the energy to enter any of these places, for as he
LINE 717: had not had any rest for ever so long, his legs felt shaky and his feet
LINE 718: weak.
LINE 719: Suddenly they also discerned ahead of them a court disclose itself to
LINE 720: view.
LINE 721: "When we get there," Chia Cheng suggested, "we must have a little rest."
LINE 722: Straightway as he uttered the remark, he led them in, and winding round
LINE 723: the jade-green peach-trees, covered with blossom, they passed through
LINE 724: the bamboo fence and flower-laden hedge, which were twisted in such a
LINE 725: way as to form a circular, cavelike gateway, when unexpectedly appeared
LINE 726: before their eyes an enclosure with whitewashed walls, in which verdant
LINE 727: willows drooped in every direction.
LINE 728: Chia Cheng entered the gateway in company with the whole party. Along
LINE 729: the whole length of both sides extended covered passages, connected with
LINE 730: each other; while in the court were laid out several rockeries. In one
LINE 731: quarter were planted a number of banana trees; on the opposite stood a
LINE 732: plant of begonia from Hsi Fu. Its appearance was like an open umbrella.
LINE 733: The gossamer hanging (from its branches) resembled golden threads. The
LINE 734: corollas (seemed) to spurt out cinnabar.
LINE 735: "What a beautiful flower! what a beautiful flower!" ejaculated the whole
LINE 736: party with one voice; "begonias are verily to be found; but never before
LINE 737: have we seen anything the like of this in beauty."
LINE 738: "This is called the maiden begonia and is, in fact, a foreign species,"
LINE 739: Chia Cheng observed. "There's a homely tradition that it is because it
LINE 740: emanates from the maiden kingdom that its flowers are most prolific; but
LINE 741: this is likewise erratic talk and devoid of common sense."
LINE 742: "They are, after all," rejoined the whole company, "so unlike others (we
LINE 743: have seen), that what's said about the maiden kingdom is, we are
LINE 744: inclined to believe, possibly a fact."
LINE 745: "I presume," interposed Pao-yü, "that some clever bard or poet,
LINE 746: (perceiving) that this flower was red like cosmetic, delicate as if
LINE 747: propped up in sickness, and that it closely resembled the nature of a
LINE 748: young lady, gave it, consequently, the name of maiden! People in the
LINE 749: world will propagate idle tales, all of which are unavoidably treated as
LINE 750: gospel!"
LINE 751: "We receive (with thanks) your instructions; what excellent
LINE 752: explanation!" they all remarked unanimously, and as they expressed these
LINE 753: words, the whole company took their seats on the sofas under the
LINE 754: colonnade.
LINE 755: "Let's think of some original text or other for a motto," Chia Cheng
LINE 756: having suggested, one of the companions opined that the two characters:
LINE 757: "Banana and stork" would be felicitous; while another one was of the
LINE 758: idea that what would be faultless would be: "Collected splendour and
LINE 759: waving elegance!"
LINE 760: "'Collected splendour and waving elegance' is excellent," Chia Cheng
LINE 761: observed addressing himself to the party; and Pao-yü himself, while also
LINE 762: extolling it as beautiful, went on to say: "There's only one thing
LINE 763: however to be regretted!"
LINE 764: "What about regret?" the company inquired.
LINE 765: "In this place," Pao-yü explained, "are set out both bananas as well as
LINE 766: begonias, with the intent of secretly combining in them the two
LINE 767: properties of red and green; and if mention of one of them be made, and
LINE 768: the other be omitted, (the device) won't be good enough for selection."
LINE 769: "What would you then suggest?" Chia Cheng asked.
LINE 770: "I would submit the four words, 'the red (flowers) are fragrant, the
LINE 771: green (banana leaves) like jade,' which would render complete the
LINE 772: beauties of both (the begonias and bananas)."
LINE 773: "It isn't good! it isn't good!" Chia Cheng remonstrated as he shook his
LINE 774: head; and while passing this remark, he conducted the party into the
LINE 775: house, where they noticed that the internal arrangements effected
LINE 776: differed from those in other places, as no partitions could, in fact, be
LINE 777: discerned. Indeed, the four sides were all alike covered with boards
LINE 778: carved hollow with fretwork, (in designs consisting) either of rolling
LINE 779: clouds and hundreds of bats; or of the three friends of the cold season
LINE 780: of the year, (fir, bamboo and almond); of scenery and human beings, or
LINE 781: of birds or flowers; either of clusters of decoration, or of relics of
LINE 782: olden times; either of ten thousand characters of happiness or of ten
LINE 783: thousand characters of longevity. The various kinds of designs had been
LINE 784: all carved by renowned hands, in variegated colours, inlaid with gold,
LINE 785: and studded with precious gems; while on shelf upon shelf were either
LINE 786: arranged collections of books, or tripods were laid out; either pens and
LINE 787: inkslabs were distributed about, or vases with flowers set out, or
LINE 788: figured pots were placed about; the designs of the shelves being either
LINE 789: round or square; or similar to sunflowers or banana leaves; or like
LINE 790: links, half overlapping each other. And in very truth they resembled
LINE 791: bouquets of flowers or clusters of tapestry, with all their fretwork so
LINE 792: transparent. Suddenly (the eye was struck) by variegated gauzes pasted
LINE 793: (on the wood-work), actually forming small windows; and of a sudden by
LINE 794: fine thin silks lightly overshadowing (the fretwork) just as if there
LINE 795: were, after all, secret doors. The whole walls were in addition traced,
LINE 796: with no regard to symmetry, with outlines of the shapes of curios and
LINE 797: nick-nacks in imitation of lutes, double-edged swords, hanging bottles
LINE 798: and the like, the whole number of which, though (apparently) suspended
LINE 799: on the walls, were all however on a same level with the surface of the
LINE 800: partition walls.
LINE 801: "What fine ingenuity!" they all exclaimed extollingly; "what a labour
LINE 802: they must have been to carry out!"
LINE 803: Chia Cheng had actually stepped in; but scarcely had they reached the
LINE 804: second stage, before the whole party readily lost sight of the way by
LINE 805: which they had come in. They glanced on the left, and there stood a
LINE 806: door, through which they could go. They cast their eyes on the right,
LINE 807: and there was a window which suddenly impeded their progress. They went
LINE 808: forward, but there again they were obstructed by a bookcase. They turned
LINE 809: their heads round, and there too stood windows pasted with transparent
LINE 810: gauze and available door-ways: but the moment they came face to face
LINE 811: with the door, they unexpectedly perceived that a whole company of
LINE 812: people had likewise walked in, just in front of them, whose appearance
LINE 813: resembled their own in every respect. But it was only a mirror. And when
LINE 814: they rounded the mirror, they detected a still larger number of doors.
LINE 815: "Sir," Chia Chen remarked with a grin; "if you'll follow me out through
LINE 816: this door, we'll forthwith get into the back-court; and once out of the
LINE 817: back-court, we shall be, at all events, nearer than we were before."
LINE 818: Taking the lead, he conducted Chia Cheng and the whole party round two
LINE 819: gauze mosquito houses, when they verily espied a door through which they
LINE 820: made their exit, into a court, replete with stands of cinnamon roses.
LINE 821: Passing round the flower-laden hedge, the only thing that spread before
LINE 822: their view was a pure stream impeding their advance. The whole company
LINE 823: was lost in admiration. "Where does this water again issue from?" they
LINE 824: cried.
LINE 825: Chia Chen pointed to a spot at a distance. "Starting originally," he
LINE 826: explained, "from that water-gate, it runs as far as the mouth of that
LINE 827: cave, when from among the hills on the north-east side, it is introduced
LINE 828: into that village, where again a diverging channel has been opened and
LINE 829: it is made to flow in a south-westerly direction; the whole volume of
LINE 830: water then runs to this spot, where collecting once more in one place,
LINE 831: it issues, on its outward course, from beneath that wall."
LINE 832: "It's most ingenious!" they one and all exclaimed, after they had
LINE 833: listened to him; but, as they uttered these words, they unawares
LINE 834: realised that a lofty hill obstructed any further progress. The whole
LINE 835: party felt very hazy about the right road. But "Come along after me,"
LINE 836: Chia Chen smilingly urged, as he at once went ahead and showed the way,
LINE 837: whereupon the company followed in his steps, and as soon as they turned
LINE 838: round the foot of the hill, a level place and broad road lay before
LINE 839: them; and wide before their faces appeared the main entrance.
LINE 840: "This is charming! this is delightful!" the party unanimously exclaimed,
LINE 841: "what wits must have been ransacked, and ingenuity attained, so as to
LINE 842: bring things to this extreme degree of excellence!"
LINE 843: Forthwith the party egressed from the garden, and Pao-yü's heart
LINE 844: anxiously longed for the society of the young ladies in the inner
LINE 845: quarters, but as he did not hear Chia Cheng bid him go, he had no help
LINE 846: but to follow him into the library. But suddenly Chia Cheng bethought
LINE 847: himself of him. "What," he said, "you haven't gone yet! the old lady
LINE 848: will I fear be anxious on your account; and is it pray that you haven't
LINE 849: as yet had enough walking?"
LINE 850: Pao-yü at length withdrew out of the library. On his arrival in the
LINE 851: court, a page, who had been in attendance on Chia Cheng, at once pressed
LINE 852: forward, and took hold of him fast in his arms. "You've been lucky
LINE 853: enough," he said, "to-day to have been in master's good graces! just a
LINE 854: while back when our old mistress despatched servants to come on several
LINE 855: occasions and ask after you, we replied that master was pleased with
LINE 856: you; for had we given any other answer, her ladyship would have sent to
LINE 857: fetch you to go in, and you wouldn't have had an opportunity of
LINE 858: displaying your talents. Every one admits that the several stanzas you
LINE 859: recently composed were superior to those of the whole company put
LINE 860: together; but you must, after the good luck you've had to-day, give us a
LINE 861: tip!"
LINE 862: "I'll give each one of you a tiao," Pao-yü rejoined smirkingly.
LINE 863: "Who of us hasn't seen a tiao?" they all exclaimed, "let's have that
LINE 864: purse of yours, and have done with it!"
LINE 865: Saying this, one by one advanced and proceeded to unloosen the purse,
LINE 866: and to unclasp the fan-case; and allowing Pao-yü no time to make any
LINE 867: remonstrance, they stripped him of every ornament in the way of
LINE 868: appendage which he carried about on his person. "Whatever we do let's
LINE 869: escort him home!" they shouted, and one after another hustled round him
LINE 870: and accompanied him as far as dowager lady Chia's door.
LINE 871: Her ladyship was at this moment awaiting his arrival, so that when she
LINE 872: saw him walk in, and she found out that (Chia Cheng) had not bullied
LINE 873: him, she felt, of course, extremely delighted. But not a long interval
LINE 874: elapsed before Hsi Jen came to serve the tea; and when she perceived
LINE 875: that on his person not one of the ornaments remained, she consequently
LINE 876: smiled and inquired: "Have all the things that you had on you been again
LINE 877: taken away by these barefaced rascals?"
LINE 878: As soon as Lin Tai-yü heard this remark, she crossed over to him and saw
LINE 879: at a glance that not one single trinket was, in fact, left. "Have you
LINE 880: also given them," she felt constrained to ask, "the purse that I gave
LINE 881: you? Well, by and by, when you again covet anything of mine, I shan't
LINE 882: let you have it."
LINE 883: After uttering these words, she returned into her apartment in high
LINE 884: dudgeon, and taking the scented bag, which Pao-yü had asked her to make
LINE 885: for him, and which she had not as yet finished, she picked up a pair of
LINE 886: scissors, and instantly cut it to pieces.
LINE 887: Pao-yü noticing that she had lost her temper, came after her with
LINE 888: hurried step, but the bag had already been cut with the scissors; and as
LINE 889: Pao-yü observed how extremely fine and artistic this scented bag was, in
LINE 890: spite of its unfinished state, he verily deplored that it should have
LINE 891: been rent to pieces for no rhyme or reason. Promptly therefore
LINE 892: unbuttoning his coat, he produced from inside the lapel the purse, which
LINE 893: had been fastened there. "Look at this!" he remarked as he handed it to
LINE 894: Tai-yü; "what kind of thing is this! have I given away to any one what
LINE 895: was yours?" Lin Tai-yü, upon seeing how much he prized it as to wear it
LINE 896: within his clothes, became alive to the fact that it was done with
LINE 897: intent, as he feared lest any one should take it away; and as this
LINE 898: conviction made her sorry that she had been so impetuous as to have cut
LINE 899: the scented bag, she lowered her head and uttered not a word.
LINE 900: "There was really no need for you to have cut it," Pao-yü observed; "but
LINE 901: as I know that you're loth to give me anything, what do you say to my
LINE 902: returning even this purse?"
LINE 903: With these words, he threw the purse in her lap and walked off; which
LINE 904: vexed Tai-yü so much the more that, after giving way to tears, she took
LINE 905: up the purse in her hands to also destroy it with the scissors, when
LINE 906: Pao-yü precipitately turned round and snatched it from her grasp.
LINE 907: "My dear cousin," he smilingly pleaded, "do spare it!" and as Tai-yü
LINE 908: dashed down the scissors and wiped her tears: "You needn't," she urged,
LINE 909: "be kind to me at one moment, and unkind at another; if you wish to have
LINE 910: a tiff, why then let's part company!" But as she spoke, she lost control
LINE 911: over her temper, and, jumping on her bed, she lay with her face turned
LINE 912: towards the inside, and set to work drying her eyes.
LINE 913: Pao-yü could not refrain from approaching her. "My dear cousin, my own
LINE 914: cousin," he added, "I confess my fault!"
LINE 915: "Go and find Pao-yü!" dowager lady Chia thereupon gave a shout from
LINE 916: where she was in the front apartment, and all the attendants explained
LINE 917: that he was in Miss Lin's room.
LINE 918: "All right, that will do! that will do!" her ladyship rejoined, when she
LINE 919: heard this reply; "let the two cousins play together; his father kept
LINE 920: him a short while back under check, for ever so long, so let him have
LINE 921: some distraction. But the only thing is that you mustn't allow them to
LINE 922: have any quarrels." To which the servants in a body expressed their
LINE 923: obedience.
LINE 924: Tai-yü, unable to put up with Pao-yü's importunity, felt compelled to
LINE 925: rise. "Your object seems to be," she remarked, "not to let me have any
LINE 926: rest. If it is, I'll run away from you." Saying which, she there and
LINE 927: then was making her way out, when Pao-yü protested with a face full of
LINE 928: smiles: "Wherever you go, I'll follow!" and as he, at the same time,
LINE 929: took the purse and began to fasten it on him, Tai-yü stretched out her
LINE 930: hand, and snatching it away, "You say you don't want it," she observed,
LINE 931: "and now you put it on again! I'm really much ashamed on your account!"
LINE 932: And these words were still on her lips when with a sound of Ch'ih, she
LINE 933: burst out laughing.
LINE 934: "My dear cousin," Pao-yü added, "to-morrow do work another scented bag
LINE 935: for me!"
LINE 936: "That too will rest upon my good pleasure," Tai-yü rejoined.
LINE 937: As they conversed, they both left the room together and walked into
LINE 938: madame Wang's suite of apartments, where, as luck would have it,
LINE 939: Pao-ch'ai was also seated.
LINE 940: Unusual commotion prevailed, at this time, over at madame Wang's, for
LINE 941: the fact is that Chia Se had already come back from Ku Su, where he had
LINE 942: selected twelve young girls, and settled about an instructor, as well as
LINE 943: about the theatrical properties and the other necessaries. And as Mrs.
LINE 944: Hsüeh had by this date moved her quarters into a separate place on the
LINE 945: northeast side, and taken up her abode in a secluded and quiet house,
LINE 946: (madame Wang) had had repairs of a distinct character executed in the
LINE 947: Pear Fragrance Court, and then issued directions that the instructor
LINE 948: should train the young actresses in this place; and casting her choice
LINE 949: upon all the women, who had, in days of old, received a training in
LINE 950: singing, and who were now old matrons with white hair, she bade them
LINE 951: have an eye over them and keep them in order. Which done, she enjoined
LINE 952: Chia Se to assume the chief control of all matters connected with the
LINE 953: daily and monthly income and outlay, as well as of the accounts of all
LINE 954: articles in use of every kind and size.
LINE 955: Lin Chih-hsiao also came to report: "that the twelve young nuns and
LINE 956: Taoist girls, who had been purchased after proper selection, had all
LINE 957: arrived, and that the twenty newly-made Taoist coats had also been
LINE 958: received. That there was besides a maiden, who though devoted to
LINE 959: asceticism, kept her chevelure unshaved; that she was originally a
LINE 960: denizen of Suchow, of a family whose ancestors were also people of
LINE 961: letters and official status; that as from her youth up she had been
LINE 962: stricken with much sickness, (her parents) had purchased a good number
LINE 963: of substitutes (to enter the convent), but all with no relief to her,
LINE 964: until at last this girl herself entered the gate of abstraction when she
LINE 965: at once recovered. That hence it was that she grew her hair, while she
LINE 966: devoted herself to an ascetic life; that she was this year eighteen
LINE 967: years of age, and that the name given to her was Miao Yü; that her
LINE 968: father and mother were, at this time, already dead; that she had only by
LINE 969: her side, two old nurses and a young servant girl to wait upon her; that
LINE 970: she was most proficient in literature, and exceedingly well versed in
LINE 971: the classics and canons; and that she was likewise very attractive as
LINE 972: far as looks went; that having heard that in the city of Ch'ang-an,
LINE 973: there were vestiges of Kuan Yin and relics of the canons inscribed on
LINE 974: leaves, she followed, last year, her teacher (to the capital). She now
LINE 975: lives," he said, "in the Lao Ni nunnery, outside the western gate; her
LINE 976: teacher was a great expert in prophetic divination, but she died in the
LINE 977: winter of last year, and her dying words were that as it was not
LINE 978: suitable for (Miao Yü) to return to her native place, she should await
LINE 979: here, as something in the way of a denouement was certain to turn up;
LINE 980: and this is the reason why she hasn't as yet borne the coffin back to
LINE 981: her home!"
LINE 982: "If such be the case," madame Wang readily suggested, "why shouldn't we
LINE 983: bring her here?"
LINE 984: "If we are to ask her," Lin Chih-hsiao's wife replied, "she'll say that
LINE 985: a marquis' family and a duke's household are sure, in their honourable
LINE 986: position, to be overbearing to people; and I had rather not go."
LINE 987: "As she's the daughter of an official family," madame Wang continued,
LINE 988: "she's bound to be inclined to be somewhat proud; but what harm is there
LINE 989: to our sending her a written invitation to ask her to come!"
LINE 990: Lin Chih-hsiao's wife assented; and leaving the room, she made the
LINE 991: secretary write an invitation and then went to ask Miao Yü. The next day
LINE 992: servants were despatched, and carriages and sedan chairs were got ready
LINE 993: to go and bring her over.
LINE 994: What subsequently transpired is not as yet known, but, reader, listen to
LINE 995: the account given in the following chapter.
