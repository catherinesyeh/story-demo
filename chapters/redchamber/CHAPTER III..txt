LINE 1: Lin Ju-hai appeals to his brother-in-law, Chia Cheng, recommending
LINE 2: Yü-ts'un, his daughter's tutor, to his consideration.
LINE 3: Dowager lady Chia sends to fetch her granddaughter, out of
LINE 4: commiseration for her being a motherless child.
LINE 5: But to proceed with our narrative.
LINE 6: Yü-ts'un, on speedily turning round, perceived that the speaker was no
LINE 7: other than a certain Chang Ju-kuei, an old colleague of his, who had
LINE 8: been denounced and deprived of office, on account of some case or other;
LINE 9: a native of that district, who had, since his degradation, resided in
LINE 10: his family home.
LINE 11: Having lately come to hear the news that a memorial, presented in the
LINE 12: capital, that the former officers (who had been cashiered) should be
LINE 13: reinstated, had received the imperial consent, he had promptly done all
LINE 14: he could, in every nook and corner, to obtain influence, and to find the
LINE 15: means (of righting his position,) when he, unexpectedly, came across
LINE 16: Yü-ts'un, to whom he therefore lost no time in offering his
LINE 17: congratulations. The two friends exchanged the conventional salutations,
LINE 18: and Chang Ju-kuei forthwith communicated the tidings to Yü-ts'un.
LINE 19: Yü-ts'un was delighted, but after he had made a few remarks, in a great
LINE 20: hurry, each took his leave and sped on his own way homewards.
LINE 21: Leng Tzu-hsing, upon hearing this conversation, hastened at once to
LINE 22: propose a plan, advising Yü-ts'un to request Lin Ju-hai, in his turn, to
LINE 23: appeal in the capital to Mr. Chia Cheng for support.
LINE 24: Yü-ts'un accepted the suggestion, and parted from his companion.
LINE 25: On his return to his quarters, he made all haste to lay his hand on the
LINE 26: Metropolitan Gazette, and having ascertained that the news was
LINE 27: authentic, he had on the next day a personal consultation with Ju-hai.
LINE 28: "Providence and good fortune are both alike propitious!" exclaimed
LINE 29: Ju-hai. "After the death of my wife, my mother-in-law, whose residence
LINE 30: is in the capital, was so very solicitous on my daughter's account, for
LINE 31: having no one to depend upon, that she despatched, at an early period,
LINE 32: boats with men and women servants to come and fetch her. But my child
LINE 33: was at the time not quite over her illness, and that is why she has not
LINE 34: yet started. I was, this very moment, cogitating to send my daughter to
LINE 35: the capital. And in view of the obligation, under which I am to you for
LINE 36: the instruction you have heretofore conferred upon her, remaining as yet
LINE 37: unrequited, there is no reason why, when such an opportunity as this
LINE 38: presents itself, I should not do my utmost to find means to make proper
LINE 39: acknowledgment. I have already, in anticipation, given the matter my
LINE 40: attention, and written a letter of recommendation to my brother-in-law,
LINE 41: urging him to put everything right for you, in order that I may, to a
LINE 42: certain extent, be able to give effect to my modest wishes. As for any
LINE 43: outlay that may prove necessary, I have given proper explanation, in the
LINE 44: letter to my brother-in-law, so that you, my brother, need not trouble
LINE 45: yourself by giving way to much anxiety."
LINE 46: As Yü-ts'un bowed and expressed his appreciation in most profuse
LINE 47: language,--
LINE 48: "Pray," he asked, "where does your honoured brother-in-law reside? and
LINE 49: what is his official capacity? But I fear I'm too coarse in my manner,
LINE 50: and could not presume to obtrude myself in his presence."
LINE 51: Ju-hai smiled. "And yet," he remarked, "this brother-in-law of mine is
LINE 52: after all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is the
LINE 53: grandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited the
LINE 54: status of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his style
LINE 55: Ngen-hou. My second brother-in-law's name is Cheng, his style is
LINE 56: Tzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in the
LINE 57: Board of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of the
LINE 58: habits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kind
LINE 59: of men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on your
LINE 60: behalf. Were he different to what he really is, not only would he cast a
LINE 61: slur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewise
LINE 62: would not have been as prompt in taking action."
LINE 63: When Yü-ts'un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had been
LINE 64: told him by Tzu-hsing the day before, and he lost no time in again
LINE 65: expressing his sense of gratitude to Lin Ju-hai.
LINE 66: Ju-hai resumed the conversation.
LINE 67: "I have fixed," (he explained,) "upon the second of next month, for my
LINE 68: young daughter's departure for the capital, and, if you, brother mine,
LINE 69: were to travel along with her, would it not be an advantage to herself,
LINE 70: as well as to yourself?"
LINE 71: Yü-ts'un signified his acquiescence as he listened to his proposal;
LINE 72: feeling in his inner self extremely elated.
LINE 73: Ju-hai availed himself of the earliest opportunity to get ready the
LINE 74: presents (for the capital) and all the requirements for the journey,
LINE 75: which (when completed,) Yü-ts'un took over one by one. His pupil could
LINE 76: not, at first, brook the idea, of a separation from her father, but the
LINE 77: pressing wishes of her grandmother left her no course (but to comply).
LINE 78: "Your father," Ju-hai furthermore argued with her, "is already fifty;
LINE 79: and I entertain no wish to marry again; and then you are always ailing;
LINE 80: besides, with your extreme youth, you have, above, no mother of your own
LINE 81: to take care of you, and below, no sisters to attend to you. If you now
LINE 82: go and have your maternal grandmother, as well as your mother's brothers
LINE 83: and your cousins to depend upon, you will be doing the best thing to
LINE 84: reduce the anxiety which I feel in my heart on your behalf. Why then
LINE 85: should you not go?"
LINE 86: Tai-yü, after listening to what her father had to say, parted from him
LINE 87: in a flood of tears and followed her nurse and several old matrons from
LINE 88: the Jung mansion on board her boat, and set out on her journey.
LINE 89: Yü-ts'un had a boat to himself, and with two youths to wait on him, he
LINE 90: prosecuted his voyage in the wake of Tai-yü.
LINE 91: By a certain day, they reached Ching Tu; and Yü-ts'un, after first
LINE 92: adjusting his hat and clothes, came, attended by a youth, to the door of
LINE 93: the Jung mansion, and sent in a card, which showed his lineage.
LINE 94: Chia Cheng had, by this time, perused his brother-in-law's letter, and
LINE 95: he speedily asked him to walk in. When they met, he found in Yü-ts'un an
LINE 96: imposing manner and polite address.
LINE 97: This Chia Cheng had, in fact, a great penchant above all things for men
LINE 98: of education, men courteous to the talented, respectful to the learned,
LINE 99: ready to lend a helping hand to the needy and to succour the distressed,
LINE 100: and was, to a great extent, like his grandfather. As it was besides a
LINE 101: wish intimated by his brother-in-law, he therefore treated Yü-ts'un with
LINE 102: a consideration still more unusual, and readily strained all his
LINE 103: resources to assist him.
LINE 104: On the very day on which the memorial was submitted to the Throne, he
LINE 105: obtained by his efforts, a reinstatement to office, and before the
LINE 106: expiry of two months, Yü-t'sun was forthwith selected to fill the
LINE 107: appointment of prefect of Ying T'ien in Chin Ling. Taking leave of Chia
LINE 108: Cheng, he chose a propitious day, and proceeded to his post, where we
LINE 109: will leave him without further notice for the present.
LINE 110: But to return to Tai-yü. On the day on which she left the boat, and the
LINE 111: moment she put her foot on shore, there were forthwith at her disposal
LINE 112: chairs for her own use, and carts for the luggage, sent over from the
LINE 113: Jung mansion.
LINE 114: Lin Tai-yü had often heard her mother recount how different was her
LINE 115: grandmother's house from that of other people's; and having seen for
LINE 116: herself how above the common run were already the attendants of the
LINE 117: three grades, (sent to wait upon her,) in attire, in their fare, in all
LINE 118: their articles of use, "how much more," (she thought to herself) "now
LINE 119: that I am going to her home, must I be careful at every step, and
LINE 120: circumspect at every moment! Nor must I utter one word too many, nor
LINE 121: make one step more than is proper, for fear lest I should be ridiculed
LINE 122: by any of them!"
LINE 123: From the moment she got into the chair, and they had entered within the
LINE 124: city walls, she found, as she looked around, through the gauze window,
LINE 125: at the bustle in the streets and public places and at the immense
LINE 126: concourse of people, everything naturally so unlike what she had seen
LINE 127: elsewhere.
LINE 128: After they had also been a considerable time on the way, she suddenly
LINE 129: caught sight, at the northern end of the street, of two huge squatting
LINE 130: lions of marble and of three lofty gates with (knockers representing)
LINE 131: the heads of animals. In front of these gates, sat, in a row, about ten
LINE 132: men in coloured hats and fine attire. The main gate was not open. It was
LINE 133: only through the side gates, on the east and west, that people went in
LINE 134: and came out. Above the centre gate was a tablet. On this tablet were
LINE 135: inscribed in five large characters--"The Ning Kuo mansion erected by
LINE 136: imperial command."
LINE 137: "This must be grandmother's eldest son's residence," reflected Tai-yü.
LINE 138: Towards the east, again, at no great distance, were three more high
LINE 139: gateways, likewise of the same kind as those she had just seen. This was
LINE 140: the Jung Kuo mansion.
LINE 141: They did not however go in by the main gate; but simply made their
LINE 142: entrance through the east side door.
LINE 143: With the sedans on their shoulders, (the bearers) proceeded about the
LINE 144: distance of the throw of an arrow, when upon turning a corner, they
LINE 145: hastily put down the chairs. The matrons, who came behind, one and all
LINE 146: also dismounted. (The bearers) were changed for four youths of seventeen
LINE 147: or eighteen, with hats and clothes without a blemish, and while they
LINE 148: carried the chair, the whole bevy of matrons followed on foot.
LINE 149: When they reached a creeper-laden gate, the sedan was put down, and all
LINE 150: the youths stepped back and retired. The matrons came forward, raised
LINE 151: the screen, and supported Tai-yü to descend from the chair.
LINE 152: Lin Tai-yü entered the door with the creepers, resting on the hand of a
LINE 153: matron.
LINE 154: On both sides was a verandah, like two outstretched arms. An Entrance
LINE 155: Hall stood in the centre, in the middle of which was a door-screen of Ta
LINE 156: Li marble, set in an ebony frame. On the other side of this screen were
LINE 157: three very small halls. At the back of these came at once an extensive
LINE 158: courtyard, belonging to the main building.
LINE 159: In the front part were five parlours, the frieze of the ceiling of which
LINE 160: was all carved, and the pillars ornamented. On either side, were covered
LINE 161: avenues, resembling passages through a rock. In the side-rooms were
LINE 162: suspended cages, full of parrots of every colour, thrushes, and birds of
LINE 163: every description.
LINE 164: On the terrace-steps, sat several waiting maids, dressed in red and
LINE 165: green, and the whole company of them advanced, with beaming faces, to
LINE 166: greet them, when they saw the party approach. "Her venerable ladyship,"
LINE 167: they said, "was at this very moment thinking of you, miss, and, by a
LINE 168: strange coincidence, here you are."
LINE 169: Three or four of them forthwith vied with each other in raising the door
LINE 170: curtain, while at the same time was heard some one announce: "Miss Lin
LINE 171: has arrived."
LINE 172: No sooner had she entered the room, than she espied two servants
LINE 173: supporting a venerable lady, with silver-white hair, coming forward to
LINE 174: greet her. Convinced that this lady must be her grandmother, she was
LINE 175: about to prostrate herself and pay her obeisance, when she was quickly
LINE 176: clasped in the arms of her grandmother, who held her close against her
LINE 177: bosom; and as she called her "my liver! my flesh!" (my love! my
LINE 178: darling!) she began to sob aloud.
LINE 179: The bystanders too, at once, without one exception, melted into tears;
LINE 180: and Tai-yü herself found some difficulty in restraining her sobs. Little
LINE 181: by little the whole party succeeded in consoling her, and Tai-yü at
LINE 182: length paid her obeisance to her grandmother. Her ladyship thereupon
LINE 183: pointed them out one by one to Tai-yü. "This," she said, "is the wife of
LINE 184: your uncle, your mother's elder brother; this is the wife of your uncle,
LINE 185: her second brother; and this is your eldest sister-in-law Chu, the wife
LINE 186: of your senior cousin Chu."
LINE 187: Tai-yü bowed to each one of them (with folded arms).
LINE 188: "Ask the young ladies in," dowager lady Chia went on to say; "tell them
LINE 189: a guest from afar has just arrived, one who comes for the first time;
LINE 190: and that they may not go to their lessons."
LINE 191: The servants with one voice signified their obedience, and two of them
LINE 192: speedily went to carry out her orders.
LINE 193: Not long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seen
LINE 194: ushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figure
LINE 195: and of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like a
LINE 196: fresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious,
LINE 197: demure, and lovable to look at.
LINE 198: The second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender was
LINE 199: she in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes so
LINE 200: beautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze a
LINE 201: bewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant manners
LINE 202: all idea of vulgarity was forgotten.
LINE 203: The third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet,
LINE 204: childlike.
LINE 205: In their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the three
LINE 206: young ladies was identical.
LINE 207: Tai-yü speedily rose to greet them and to exchange salutations. After
LINE 208: they had made each other's acquaintance, they all took a seat, whereupon
LINE 209: the servants brought the tea. Their conversation was confined to
LINE 210: Tai-yü's mother,--how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her,
LINE 211: what medicines had been given her, and how she had been buried and
LINE 212: mourned; and dowager lady Chia was naturally again in great anguish.
LINE 213: "Of all my daughters," she remarked, "your mother was the one I loved
LINE 214: best, and now in a twinkle, she has passed away, before me too, and I've
LINE 215: not been able to so much as see her face. How can this not make my heart
LINE 216: sore-stricken?"
LINE 217: And as she gave vent to these feelings, she took Tai-yü's hand in hers,
LINE 218: and again gave way to sobs; and it was only after the members of the
LINE 219: family had quickly made use of much exhortation and coaxing, that they
LINE 220: succeeded, little by little, in stopping her tears.
LINE 221: They all perceived that Tai-yü, despite her youthful years and
LINE 222: appearance, was lady-like in her deportment and address, and that though
LINE 223: with her delicate figure and countenance, (she seemed as if) unable to
LINE 224: bear the very weight of her clothes, she possessed, however, a certain
LINE 225: captivating air. And as they readily noticed the symptoms of a weak
LINE 226: constitution, they went on in consequence to make inquiries as to what
LINE 227: medicines she ordinarily took, and how it was that her complaint had not
LINE 228: been cured.
LINE 229: "I have," explained Tai-yü, "been in this state ever since I was born;
LINE 230: though I've taken medicines from the very time I was able to eat rice,
LINE 231: up to the present, and have been treated by ever so many doctors of
LINE 232: note, I've not derived any benefit. In the year when I was yet only
LINE 233: three, I remember a mangy-headed bonze coming to our house, and saying
LINE 234: that he would take me along, and make a nun of me; but my father and
LINE 235: mother would, on no account, give their consent. 'As you cannot bear to
LINE 236: part from her and to give her up,' he then remarked, 'her ailment will,
LINE 237: I fear, never, throughout her life, be cured. If you wish to see her all
LINE 238: right, it is only to be done by not letting her, from this day forward,
LINE 239: on any account, listen to the sound of weeping, or see, with the
LINE 240: exception of her parents, any relatives outside the family circle. Then
LINE 241: alone will she be able to go through this existence in peace and in
LINE 242: quiet.' No one heeded the nonsensical talk of this raving priest; but
LINE 243: here am I, up to this very day, dosing myself with ginseng pills as a
LINE 244: tonic."
LINE 245: "What a lucky coincidence!" interposed dowager lady Chia; "some of these
LINE 246: pills are being compounded here, and I'll simply tell them to have an
LINE 247: extra supply made; that's all."
LINE 248: Hardly had she finished these words, when a sound of laughter was heard
LINE 249: from the back courtyard. "Here I am too late!" the voice said, "and not
LINE 250: in time to receive the distant visitor!"
LINE 251: "Every one of all these people," reflected Tai-yü, "holds her peace and
LINE 252: suppresses the very breath of her mouth; and who, I wonder, is this
LINE 253: coming in this reckless and rude manner?"
LINE 254: While, as yet, preoccupied with these thoughts, she caught sight of a
LINE 255: crowd of married women and waiting-maids enter from the back room,
LINE 256: pressing round a regular beauty.
LINE 257: The attire of this person bore no similarity to that of the young
LINE 258: ladies. In all her splendour and lustre, she looked like a fairy or a
LINE 259: goddess. In her coiffure, she had a band of gold filigree work,
LINE 260: representing the eight precious things, inlaid with pearls; and wore
LINE 261: pins, at the head of each of which were five phoenixes in a rampant
LINE 262: position, with pendants of pearls. On her neck, she had a reddish gold
LINE 263: necklet, like coiled dragons, with a fringe of tassels. On her person,
LINE 264: she wore a tight-sleeved jacket, of dark red flowered satin, covered
LINE 265: with hundreds of butterflies, embroidered in gold, interspersed with
LINE 266: flowers. Over all, she had a variegated stiff-silk pelisse, lined with
LINE 267: slate-blue ermine; while her nether garments consisted of a jupe of
LINE 268: kingfisher-colour foreign crepe, brocaded with flowers.
LINE 269: She had a pair of eyes, triangular in shape like those of the red
LINE 270: phoenix, two eyebrows, curved upwards at each temple, like willow
LINE 271: leaves. Her stature was elegant; her figure graceful; her powdered face
LINE 272: like dawning spring, majestic, yet not haughty. Her carnation lips, long
LINE 273: before they parted, betrayed a smile.
LINE 274: Tai-yü eagerly rose and greeted her.
LINE 275: Old lady Chia then smiled. "You don't know her," she observed. "This is
LINE 276: a cunning vixen, who has made quite a name in this establishment! In
LINE 277: Nanking, she went by the appellation of vixen, and if you simply call
LINE 278: her Feng Vixen, it will do."
LINE 279: Tai-yü was just at a loss how to address her, when all her cousins
LINE 280: informed Tai-yü, that this was her sister-in-law Lien.
LINE 281: Tai-yü had not, it is true, made her acquaintance before, but she had
LINE 282: heard her mother mention that her eldest maternal uncle Chia She's son,
LINE 283: Chia Lien, had married the niece of Madame Wang, her second brother's
LINE 284: wife, a girl who had, from her infancy, purposely been nurtured to
LINE 285: supply the place of a son, and to whom the school name of Wang Hsi-feng
LINE 286: had been given.
LINE 287: Tai-yü lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with all
LINE 288: propriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law. This Hsi-feng laid hold
LINE 289: of Tai-yü's hand, and minutely scrutinised her, for a while, from head
LINE 290: to foot; after which she led her back next to dowager lady Chia, where
LINE 291: they both took a seat.
LINE 292: "If really there be a being of such beauty in the world," she
LINE 293: consequently observed with a smile, "I may well consider as having set
LINE 294: eyes upon it to-day! Besides, in the air of her whole person, she
LINE 295: doesn't in fact look like your granddaughter-in-law, our worthy
LINE 296: ancestor, but in every way like your ladyship's own kindred-
LINE 297: granddaughter! It's no wonder then that your venerable ladyship
LINE 298: should have, day after day, had her unforgotten, even for a second, in
LINE 299: your lips and heart. It's a pity, however, that this cousin of mine
LINE 300: should have such a hard lot! How did it happen that our aunt died at
LINE 301: such an early period?"
LINE 302: As she uttered these words, she hastily took her handkerchief and wiped
LINE 303: the tears from her eyes.
LINE 304: "I've only just recovered from a fit of crying," dowager lady Chia
LINE 305: observed, as she smiled, "and have you again come to start me? Your
LINE 306: cousin has only now arrived from a distant journey, and she is so
LINE 307: delicate to boot! Besides, we have a few minutes back succeeded in
LINE 308: coaxing her to restrain her sobs, so drop at once making any allusion to
LINE 309: your former remarks!"
LINE 310: This Hsi-feng, upon hearing these words, lost no time in converting her
LINE 311: sorrow into joy.
LINE 312: "Quite right," she remarked. "But at the sight of my cousin, my whole
LINE 313: heart was absorbed in her, and I felt happy, and yet wounded at heart:
LINE 314: but having disregarded my venerable ancestor's presence, I deserve to be
LINE 315: beaten, I do indeed!"
LINE 316: And hastily taking once more Tai-yü's hand in her own: "How old are you,
LINE 317: cousin?" she inquired; "Have you been to school? What medicines are you
LINE 318: taking? while you live here, you mustn't feel homesick; and if there's
LINE 319: anything you would like to eat, or to play with, mind you come and tell
LINE 320: me! or should the waiting maids or the matrons fail in their duties,
LINE 321: don't forget also to report them to me."
LINE 322: Addressing at the same time the matrons, she went on to ask, "Have Miss
LINE 323: Lin's luggage and effects been brought in? How many servants has she
LINE 324: brought along with her? Go, as soon as you can, and sweep two lower
LINE 325: rooms and ask them to go and rest."
LINE 326: As she spake, tea and refreshments had already been served, and Hsi-feng
LINE 327: herself handed round the cups and offered the fruits.
LINE 328: Upon hearing the question further put by her maternal aunt Secunda,
LINE 329: "Whether the issue of the monthly allowances of money had been finished
LINE 330: or not yet?" Hsi-feng replied: "The issue of the money has also been
LINE 331: completed; but a few moments back, when I went along with several
LINE 332: servants to the back upper-loft, in search of the satins, we looked for
LINE 333: ever so long, but we saw nothing of the kind of satins alluded to by
LINE 334: you, madame, yesterday; so may it not be that your memory misgives you?"
LINE 335: "Whether there be any or not, of that special kind, is of no
LINE 336: consequence," observed madame Wang. "You should take out," she therefore
LINE 337: went on to add, "any two pieces which first come under your hand, for
LINE 338: this cousin of yours to make herself dresses with; and in the evening,
LINE 339: if I don't forget, I'll send some one to fetch them."
LINE 340: "I've in fact already made every provision," rejoined Hsi-feng; "knowing
LINE 341: very well that my cousin would be arriving within these two days, I have
LINE 342: had everything got ready for her. And when you, madame, go back, if you
LINE 343: will pass an eye over everything, I shall be able to send them round."
LINE 344: Madame Wang gave a smile, nodded her head assentingly, but uttered not a
LINE 345: word by way of reply.
LINE 346: The tea and fruit had by this time been cleared, and dowager lady Chia
LINE 347: directed two old nurses to take Tai-yü to go and see her two maternal
LINE 348: uncles; whereupon Chia She's wife, madame Hsing, hastily stood up and
LINE 349: with a smiling face suggested, "I'll take my niece over; for it will
LINE 350: after all be considerably better if I go!"
LINE 351: "Quite so!" answered dowager lady Chia, smiling; "you can go home too,
LINE 352: and there will be no need for you to come over again!"
LINE 353: Madame Hsing expressed her assent, and forthwith led Tai-yü to take
LINE 354: leave of madame Wang. The whole party escorted them as far as the door
LINE 355: of the Entrance Hall, hung with creepers, where several youths had drawn
LINE 356: a carriage, painted light blue, with a kingfisher-coloured hood.
LINE 357: Madame Hsing led Tai-yü by the hand and they got up into their seats.
LINE 358: The whole company of matrons put the curtain down, and then bade the
LINE 359: youths raise the carriage; who dragged it along, until they came to an
LINE 360: open space, where they at length put the mules into harness.
LINE 361: Going out again by the eastern side gate, they proceeded in an easterly
LINE 362: direction, passed the main entrance of the Jung mansion, and entered a
LINE 363: lofty doorway painted black. On the arrival in front of the ceremonial
LINE 364: gate, they at once dismounted from the curricle, and madame Hsing,
LINE 365: hand-in-hand with Tai-yü, walked into the court.
LINE 366: "These grounds," surmised Tai-yü to herself, "must have been originally
LINE 367: converted from a piece partitioned from the garden of the Jung mansion."
LINE 368: Having entered three rows of ceremonial gates they actually caught sight
LINE 369: of the main structure, with its vestibules and porches, all of which,
LINE 370: though on a small scale, were full of artistic and unique beauty. They
LINE 371: were nothing like the lofty, imposing, massive and luxurious style of
LINE 372: architecture on the other side, yet the avenues and rockeries, in the
LINE 373: various places in the court, were all in perfect taste.
LINE 374: When they reached the interior of the principal pavilion, a large
LINE 375: concourse of handmaids and waiting maids, got up in gala dress, were
LINE 376: already there to greet them. Madame Hsing pressed Tai-yü into a seat,
LINE 377: while she bade some one go into the outer library and request Mr. Chia
LINE 378: She to come over.
LINE 379: In a few minutes the servant returned. "Master," she explained, "says:
LINE 380: 'that he has not felt quite well for several days, that as the meeting
LINE 381: with Miss Lin will affect both her as well as himself, he does not for
LINE 382: the present feel equal to seeing each other, that he advises Miss Lin
LINE 383: not to feel despondent or homesick; that she ought to feel quite at home
LINE 384: with her venerable ladyship, (her grandmother,) as well as her maternal
LINE 385: aunts; that her cousins are, it is true, blunt, but that if all the
LINE 386: young ladies associated together in one place, they may also perchance
LINE 387: dispel some dulness; that if ever (Miss Lin) has any grievance, she
LINE 388: should at once speak out, and on no account feel a stranger; and
LINE 389: everything will then be right."
LINE 390: Tai-yü lost no time in respectfully standing up, resuming her seat after
LINE 391: she had listened to every sentence of the message to her. After a while,
LINE 392: she said goodbye, and though madame Hsing used every argument to induce
LINE 393: her to stay for the repast and then leave, Tai-yü smiled and said, "I
LINE 394: shouldn't under ordinary circumstances refuse the invitation to dinner,
LINE 395: which you, aunt, in your love kindly extend to me, but I have still to
LINE 396: cross over and pay my respects to my maternal uncle Secundus; if I went
LINE 397: too late, it would, I fear, be a lack of respect on my part; but I shall
LINE 398: accept on another occasion. I hope therefore that you will, dear aunt,
LINE 399: kindly excuse me."
LINE 400: "If such be the case," madame Hsing replied, "it's all right." And
LINE 401: presently directing two nurses to take her niece over, in the carriage,
LINE 402: in which they had come a while back, Tai-yü thereupon took her leave;
LINE 403: madame Hsing escorting her as far as the ceremonial gate, where she gave
LINE 404: some further directions to all the company of servants. She followed the
LINE 405: curricle with her eyes so long as it remained in sight, and at length
LINE 406: retraced her footsteps.
LINE 407: Tai-yü shortly entered the Jung Mansion, descended from the carriage,
LINE 408: and preceded by all the nurses, she at once proceeded towards the east,
LINE 409: turned a corner, passed through an Entrance Hall, running east and west,
LINE 410: and walked in a southern direction, at the back of the Large Hall. On
LINE 411: the inner side of a ceremonial gate, and at the upper end of a spacious
LINE 412: court, stood a large main building, with five apartments, flanked on
LINE 413: both sides by out-houses (stretching out) like the antlers on the head
LINE 414: of deer; side-gates, resembling passages through a hill, establishing a
LINE 415: thorough communication all round; (a main building) lofty, majestic,
LINE 416: solid and grand, and unlike those in the compound of dowager lady Chia.
LINE 417: Tai-yü readily concluded that this at last was the main inner suite of
LINE 418: apartments. A raised broad road led in a straight line to the large
LINE 419: gate. Upon entering the Hall, and raising her head, she first of all
LINE 420: perceived before her a large tablet with blue ground, upon which figured
LINE 421: nine dragons of reddish gold. The inscription on this tablet consisted
LINE 422: of three characters as large as a peck-measure, and declared that this
LINE 423: was the Hall of Glorious Felicity.
LINE 424: At the end, was a row of characters of minute size, denoting the year,
LINE 425: month and day, upon which His Majesty had been pleased to confer the
LINE 426: tablet upon Chia Yuan, Duke of Jung Kuo. Besides this tablet, were
LINE 427: numberless costly articles bearing the autograph of the Emperor. On the
LINE 428: large black ebony table, engraved with dragons, were placed three
LINE 429: antique blue and green bronze tripods, about three feet in height. On
LINE 430: the wall hung a large picture representing black dragons, such as were
LINE 431: seen in waiting chambers of the Sui dynasty. On one side stood a gold
LINE 432: cup of chased work, while on the other, a crystal casket. On the ground
LINE 433: were placed, in two rows, sixteen chairs, made of hard-grained cedar.
LINE 434: There was also a pair of scrolls consisting of black-wood antithetical
LINE 435: tablets, inlaid with the strokes of words in chased gold. Their burden
LINE 436: was this:
LINE 437: On the platform shine resplendent pearls like sun or moon,
LINE 438: And the sheen of the Hall façade gleams like russet sky.
LINE 439: Below, was a row of small characters, denoting that the scroll had been
LINE 440: written by the hand of Mu Shih, a fellow-countryman and old friend of
LINE 441: the family, who, for his meritorious services, had the hereditary title
LINE 442: of Prince of Tung Ngan conferred upon him.
LINE 443: The fact is that madame Wang was also not in the habit of sitting and
LINE 444: resting, in this main apartment, but in three side-rooms on the east, so
LINE 445: that the nurses at once led Tai-yü through the door of the eastern wing.
LINE 446: On a stove-couch, near the window, was spread a foreign red carpet. On
LINE 447: the side of honour, were laid deep red reclining-cushions, with dragons,
LINE 448: with gold cash (for scales), and an oblong brown-coloured
LINE 449: sitting-cushion with gold-cash-spotted dragons. On the two sides, stood
LINE 450: one of a pair of small teapoys of foreign lacquer of peach-blossom
LINE 451: pattern. On the teapoy on the left, were spread out Wen Wang tripods,
LINE 452: spoons, chopsticks and scent-bottles. On the teapoy on the right, were
LINE 453: vases from the Ju Kiln, painted with girls of great beauty, in which
LINE 454: were placed seasonable flowers; (on it were) also teacups, a tea service
LINE 455: and the like articles.
LINE 456: On the floor on the west side of the room, were four chairs in a row,
LINE 457: all of which were covered with antimacassars, embroidered with
LINE 458: silverish-red flowers, while below, at the feet of these chairs, stood
LINE 459: four footstools. On either side, was also one of a pair of high teapoys,
LINE 460: and these teapoys were covered with teacups and flower vases.
LINE 461: The other nick-nacks need not be minutely described.
LINE 462: The old nurses pressed Tai-yü to sit down on the stove-couch; but, on
LINE 463: perceiving near the edge of the couch two embroidered cushions, placed
LINE 464: one opposite the other, she thought of the gradation of seats, and did
LINE 465: not therefore place herself on the couch, but on a chair on the eastern
LINE 466: side of the room; whereupon the waiting maids, in attendance in these
LINE 467: quarters, hastened to serve the tea.
LINE 468: While Tai-yü was sipping her tea, she observed the headgear, dress,
LINE 469: deportment and manners of the several waiting maids, which she really
LINE 470: found so unlike what she had seen in other households. She had hardly
LINE 471: finished her tea, when she noticed a waiting maid approach, dressed in a
LINE 472: red satin jacket, and a waistcoat of blue satin with scollops.
LINE 473: "My lady requests Miss Lin to come over and sit with her," she remarked
LINE 474: as she put on a smile.
LINE 475: The old nurses, upon hearing this message, speedily ushered Tai-yü again
LINE 476: out of this apartment, into the three-roomed small main building by the
LINE 477: eastern porch.
LINE 478: On the stove-couch, situated at the principal part of the room, was
LINE 479: placed, in a transverse position, a low couch-table, at the upper end of
LINE 480: which were laid out, in a heap, books and a tea service. Against the
LINE 481: partition-wall, on the east side, facing the west, was a reclining
LINE 482: pillow, made of blue satin, neither old nor new.
LINE 483: Madame Wang, however, occupied the lower seat, on the west side, on
LINE 484: which was likewise placed a rather shabby blue satin sitting-rug, with a
LINE 485: back-cushion; and upon perceiving Tai-yü come in she urged her at once
LINE 486: to sit on the east side.
LINE 487: Tai-yü concluded, in her mind, that this seat must certainly belong to
LINE 488: Chia Cheng, and espying, next to the couch, a row of three chairs,
LINE 489: covered with antimacassars, strewn with embroidered flowers, somewhat
LINE 490: also the worse for use, Tai-yü sat down on one of these chairs.
LINE 491: But as madame Wang pressed her again and again to sit on the couch,
LINE 492: Tai-yü had at length to take a seat next to her.
LINE 493: "Your uncle," madame Wang explained, "is gone to observe this day as a
LINE 494: fast day, but you'll see him by and bye. There's, however, one thing I
LINE 495: want to talk to you about. Your three female cousins are all, it is
LINE 496: true, everything that is nice; and you will, when later on you come
LINE 497: together for study, or to learn how to do needlework, or whenever, at
LINE 498: any time, you romp and laugh together, find them all most obliging; but
LINE 499: there's one thing that causes me very much concern. I have here one, who
LINE 500: is the very root of retribution, the incarnation of all mischief, one
LINE 501: who is a ne'er-do-well, a prince of malignant spirits in this family. He
LINE 502: is gone to-day to pay his vows in the temple, and is not back yet, but
LINE 503: you will see him in the evening, when you will readily be able to judge
LINE 504: for yourself. One thing you must do, and that is, from this time forth,
LINE 505: not to pay any notice to him. All these cousins of yours don't venture
LINE 506: to bring any taint upon themselves by provoking him."
LINE 507: Tai-yü had in days gone by heard her mother explain that she had a
LINE 508: nephew, born into the world, holding a piece of jade in his mouth, who
LINE 509: was perverse beyond measure, who took no pleasure in his books, and
LINE 510: whose sole great delight was to play the giddy dog in the inner
LINE 511: apartments; that her maternal grandmother, on the other hand, loved him
LINE 512: so fondly that no one ever presumed to call him to account, so that
LINE 513: when, in this instance, she heard madame Wang's advice, she at once felt
LINE 514: certain that it must be this very cousin.
LINE 515: "Isn't it to the cousin born with jade in his mouth, that you are
LINE 516: alluding to, aunt?" she inquired as she returned her smile. "When I was
LINE 517: at home, I remember my mother telling me more than once of this very
LINE 518: cousin, who (she said) was a year older than I, and whose infant name
LINE 519: was Pao-yü. She added that his disposition was really wayward, but that
LINE 520: he treats all his cousins with the utmost consideration. Besides, now
LINE 521: that I have come here, I shall, of course, be always together with my
LINE 522: female cousins, while the boys will have their own court, and separate
LINE 523: quarters; and how ever will there be any cause of bringing any slur upon
LINE 524: myself by provoking him?"
LINE 525: "You don't know the reasons (that prompt me to warn you)," replied
LINE 526: madame Wang laughingly. "He is so unlike all the rest, all because he
LINE 527: has, since his youth up, been doated upon by our old lady! The fact is
LINE 528: that he has been spoilt, through over-indulgence, by being always in the
LINE 529: company of his female cousins! If his female cousins pay no heed to him,
LINE 530: he is, at any rate, somewhat orderly, but the day his cousins say one
LINE 531: word more to him than usual, much trouble forthwith arises, at the
LINE 532: outburst of delight in his heart. That's why I enjoin upon you not to
LINE 533: heed him. From his mouth, at one time, issue sugared words and
LINE 534: mellifluous phrases; and at another, like the heavens devoid of the sun,
LINE 535: he becomes a raving fool; so whatever you do, don't believe all he
LINE 536: says."
LINE 537: Tai-yü was assenting to every bit of advice as it was uttered, when
LINE 538: unexpectedly she beheld a waiting-maid walk in. "Her venerable ladyship
LINE 539: over there," she said, "has sent word about the evening meal."
LINE 540: Madame Wang hastily took Tai-yü by the hand, and emerging by the door of
LINE 541: the back-room, they went eastwards by the verandah at the back. Past the
LINE 542: side gate, was a roadway, running north and south. On the southern side
LINE 543: were a pavilion with three divisions and a Reception Hall with a
LINE 544: colonnade. On the north, stood a large screen wall, painted white;
LINE 545: behind it was a very small building, with a door of half the ordinary
LINE 546: size.
LINE 547: "These are your cousin Feng's rooms," explained madame Wang to Tai-yü,
LINE 548: as she pointed to them smiling. "You'll know in future your way to come
LINE 549: and find her; and if you ever lack anything, mind you mention it to her,
LINE 550: and she'll make it all right."
LINE 551: At the door of this court, were also several youths, who had recently
LINE 552: had the tufts of their hair tied together, who all dropped their hands
LINE 553: against their sides, and stood in a respectful posture. Madame Wang then
LINE 554: led Tai-yü by the hand through a corridor, running east and west, into
LINE 555: what was dowager lady Chia's back-court. Forthwith they entered the door
LINE 556: of the back suite of rooms, where stood, already in attendance, a large
LINE 557: number of servants, who, when they saw madame Wang arrive, set to work
LINE 558: setting the tables and chairs in order.
LINE 559: Chia Chu's wife, née Li, served the eatables, while Hsi-feng placed the
LINE 560: chopsticks, and madame Wang brought the soup in. Dowager lady Chia was
LINE 561: seated all alone on the divan, in the main part of the apartment, on the
LINE 562: two sides of which stood four vacant chairs.
LINE 563: Hsi-feng at once drew Tai-yü, meaning to make her sit in the foremost
LINE 564: chair on the left side, but Tai-yü steadily and concedingly declined.
LINE 565: "Your aunts and sisters-in-law, standing on the right and left," dowager
LINE 566: lady Chia smilingly explained, "won't have their repast in here, and as
LINE 567: you're a guest, it's but proper that you should take that seat."
LINE 568: Then alone it was that Tai-yü asked for permission to sit down, seating
LINE 569: herself on the chair.
LINE 570: Madame Wang likewise took a seat at old lady Chia's instance; and the
LINE 571: three cousins, Ying Ch'un and the others, having craved for leave to sit
LINE 572: down, at length came forward, and Ying Ch'un took the first chair on the
LINE 573: right, T'an Ch'un the second, and Hsi Ch'un the second on the left.
LINE 574: Waiting maids stood by holding in their hands, flips and finger-bowls
LINE 575: and napkins, while Mrs. Li and lady Feng, the two of them, kept near the
LINE 576: table advising them what to eat, and pressing them to help themselves.
LINE 577: In the outer apartments, the married women and waiting-maids in
LINE 578: attendance, were, it is true, very numerous; but not even so much as the
LINE 579: sound of the cawing of a crow could be heard.
LINE 580: The repast over, each one was presented by a waiting-maid, with tea in a
LINE 581: small tea tray; but the Lin family had all along impressed upon the mind
LINE 582: of their daughter that in order to show due regard to happiness, and to
LINE 583: preserve good health, it was essential, after every meal, to wait a
LINE 584: while, before drinking any tea, so that it should not do any harm to the
LINE 585: intestines. When, therefore, Tai-yü perceived how many habits there were
LINE 586: in this establishment unlike those which prevailed in her home, she too
LINE 587: had no alternative but to conform herself to a certain extent with them.
LINE 588: Upon taking over the cup of tea, servants came once more and presented
LINE 589: finger-bowls for them to rinse their mouths, and Tai-yü also rinsed
LINE 590: hers; and after they had all again finished washing their hands, tea was
LINE 591: eventually served a second time, and this was, at length, the tea that
LINE 592: was intended to be drunk.
LINE 593: "You can all go," observed dowager lady Chia, "and let us alone to have
LINE 594: a chat."
LINE 595: Madame Wang rose as soon as she heard these words, and having made a few
LINE 596: irrelevant remarks, she led the way and left the room along with the two
LINE 597: ladies, Mrs. Li and lady Feng.
LINE 598: Dowager lady Chia, having inquired of Tai-yü what books she was reading,
LINE 599: "I have just begun reading the Four Books," Tai-yü replied. "What books
LINE 600: are my cousins reading?" Tai-yü went on to ask.
LINE 601: "Books, you say!" exclaimed dowager lady Chia; "why all they know are a
LINE 602: few characters, that's all."
LINE 603: The sentence was barely out of her lips, when a continuous sounding of
LINE 604: footsteps was heard outside, and a waiting maid entered and announced
LINE 605: that Pao-yü was coming. Tai-yü was speculating in her mind how it was
LINE 606: that this Pao-yü had turned out such a good-for-nothing fellow, when he
LINE 607: happened to walk in.
LINE 608: He was, in fact, a young man of tender years, wearing on his head, to
LINE 609: hold his hair together, a cap of gold of purplish tinge, inlaid with
LINE 610: precious gems. Parallel with his eyebrows was attached a circlet,
LINE 611: embroidered with gold, and representing two dragons snatching a pearl.
LINE 612: He wore an archery-sleeved deep red jacket, with hundreds of butterflies
LINE 613: worked in gold of two different shades, interspersed with flowers; and
LINE 614: was girded with a sash of variegated silk, with clusters of designs, to
LINE 615: which was attached long tassels; a kind of sash worn in the palace. Over
LINE 616: all, he had a slate-blue fringed coat of Japanese brocaded satin, with
LINE 617: eight bunches of flowers in relief; and wore a pair of light blue satin
LINE 618: white-soled, half-dress court-shoes.
LINE 619: His face was like the full moon at mid-autumn; his complexion, like
LINE 620: morning flowers in spring; the hair along his temples, as if chiselled
LINE 621: with a knife; his eyebrows, as if pencilled with ink; his nose like a
LINE 622: suspended gallbladder (a well-cut and shapely nose); his eyes like
LINE 623: vernal waves; his angry look even resembled a smile; his glance, even
LINE 624: when stern, was full of sentiment.
LINE 625: Round his neck he had a gold dragon necklet with a fringe; also a cord
LINE 626: of variegated silk, to which was attached a piece of beautiful jade.
LINE 627: As soon as Tai-yü became conscious of his presence, she was quite taken
LINE 628: aback. "How very strange!" she was reflecting in her mind; "it would
LINE 629: seem as if I had seen him somewhere or other, for his face appears
LINE 630: extremely familiar to my eyes;" when she noticed Pao-yü face dowager
LINE 631: lady Chia and make his obeisance. "Go and see your mother and then come
LINE 632: back," remarked her venerable ladyship; and at once he turned round and
LINE 633: quitted the room.
LINE 634: On his return, he had already changed his hat and suit. All round his
LINE 635: head, he had a fringe of short hair, plaited into small queues, and
LINE 636: bound with red silk. The queues were gathered up at the crown, and all
LINE 637: the hair, which had been allowed to grow since his birth, was plaited
LINE 638: into a thick queue, which looked as black and as glossy as lacquer.
LINE 639: Between the crown of the head and the extremity of the queue, hung a
LINE 640: string of four large pearls, with pendants of gold, representing the
LINE 641: eight precious things. On his person, he wore a long silvery-red coat,
LINE 642: more or less old, bestrewn with embroidery of flowers. He had still
LINE 643: round his neck the necklet, precious gem, amulet of Recorded Name,
LINE 644: philacteries, and other ornaments. Below were partly visible a fir-cone
LINE 645: coloured brocaded silk pair of trousers, socks spotted with black
LINE 646: designs, with ornamented edges, and a pair of deep red, thick-soled
LINE 647: shoes.
LINE 648: (Got up as he was now,) his face displayed a still whiter appearance, as
LINE 649: if painted, and his eyes as if they were set off with carnation. As he
LINE 650: rolled his eyes, they brimmed with love. When he gave utterance to
LINE 651: speech, he seemed to smile. But the chief natural pleasing feature was
LINE 652: mainly centred in the curve of his eyebrows. The ten thousand and one
LINE 653: fond sentiments, fostered by him during the whole of his existence, were
LINE 654: all amassed in the corner of his eyes.
LINE 655: His outward appearance may have been pleasing to the highest degree, but
LINE 656: yet it was no easy matter to fathom what lay beneath it.
LINE 657: There are a couple of roundelays, composed by a later poet, (after the
LINE 658: excellent rhythm of the) Hsi Chiang Yueh, which depict Pao-yü in a most
LINE 659: adequate manner.
LINE 660: The roundelays run as follows:
LINE 661: To gloom and passion prone, without a rhyme,
LINE 662: Inane and madlike was he many a time,
LINE 663: His outer self, forsooth, fine may have been,
LINE 664: But one wild, howling waste his mind within:
LINE 665: Addled his brain that nothing he could see;
LINE 666: A dunce! to read essays so loth to be!
LINE 667: Perverse in bearing, in temper wayward;
LINE 668: For human censure he had no regard.
LINE 669: When rich, wealth to enjoy he knew not how;
LINE 670: When poor, to poverty he could not bow.
LINE 671: Alas! what utter waste of lustrous grace!
LINE 672: To state, to family what a disgrace!
LINE 673: Of ne'er-do-wells below he was the prime,
LINE 674: Unfilial like him none up to this time.
LINE 675: Ye lads, pampered with sumptuous fare and dress,
LINE 676: Beware! In this youth's footsteps do not press!
LINE 677: But to proceed with our story.
LINE 678: "You have gone and changed your clothes," observed dowager lady Chia,
LINE 679: "before being introduced to the distant guest. Why don't you yet salute
LINE 680: your cousin?"
LINE 681: Pao-yü had long ago become aware of the presence of a most beautiful
LINE 682: young lady, who, he readily concluded, must be no other than the
LINE 683: daughter of his aunt Lin. He hastened to advance up to her, and make his
LINE 684: bow; and after their introduction, he resumed his seat, whence he
LINE 685: minutely scrutinised her features, (which he thought) so unlike those of
LINE 686: all other girls.
LINE 687: Her two arched eyebrows, thick as clustered smoke, bore a certain not
LINE 688: very pronounced frowning wrinkle. She had a pair of eyes, which
LINE 689: possessed a cheerful, and yet one would say, a sad expression,
LINE 690: overflowing with sentiment. Her face showed the prints of sorrow stamped
LINE 691: on her two dimpled cheeks. She was beautiful, but her whole frame was
LINE 692: the prey of a hereditary disease. The tears in her eyes glistened like
LINE 693: small specks. Her balmy breath was so gentle. She was as demure as a
LINE 694: lovely flower reflected in the water. Her gait resembled a frail willow,
LINE 695: agitated by the wind. Her heart, compared with that of Pi Kan, had one
LINE 696: more aperture of intelligence; while her ailment exceeded (in intensity)
LINE 697: by three degrees the ailment of Hsi-Tzu.
LINE 698: Pao-yü, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said,
LINE 699: "This cousin I have already seen in days gone by."
LINE 700: "There you are again with your nonsense," exclaimed lady Chia,
LINE 701: sneeringly; "how could you have seen her before?"
LINE 702: "Though I may not have seen her, ere this," observed Pao-yü with a
LINE 703: smirk, "yet when I look at her face, it seems so familiar, and to my
LINE 704: mind, it would appear as if we had been old acquaintances; just as if,
LINE 705: in fact, we were now meeting after a long separation."
LINE 706: "That will do! that will do!" remarked dowager lady Chia; "such being
LINE 707: the case, you will be the more intimate."
LINE 708: Pao-yü, thereupon, went up to Tai-yü, and taking a seat next to her,
LINE 709: continued to look at her again with all intentness for a good long
LINE 710: while.
LINE 711: "Have you read any books, cousin?" he asked.
LINE 712: "I haven't as yet," replied Tai-yü, "read any books, as I have only been
LINE 713: to school for a year; all I know are simply a few characters."
LINE 714: "What is your worthy name, cousin?" Pao-yü went on to ask; whereupon
LINE 715: Tai-yü speedily told him her name.
LINE 716: "Your style?" inquired Pao-yü; to which question Tai-yü replied, "I have
LINE 717: no style."
LINE 718: "I'll give you a style," suggested Pao-yü smilingly; "won't the double
LINE 719: style 'P'in P'in,' 'knitting brows,' do very well?"
LINE 720: "From what part of the standard books does that come?" T'an Ch'un
LINE 721: hastily interposed.
LINE 722: "It is stated in the Thorough Research into the state of Creation from
LINE 723: remote ages to the present day," Pao-yü went on to explain, "that, in
LINE 724: the western quarter, there exists a stone, called Tai, (black,) which
LINE 725: can be used, in lieu of ink, to blacken the eyebrows with. Besides the
LINE 726: eyebrows of this cousin taper in a way, as if they were contracted, so
LINE 727: that the selection of these two characters is most appropriate, isn't
LINE 728: it?"
LINE 729: "This is just another plagiarism, I fear," observed T'an Ch'un, with an
LINE 730: ironic smirk.
LINE 731: "Exclusive of the Four Books," Pao-yü remarked smilingly, "the majority
LINE 732: of works are plagiarised; and is it only I, perchance, who plagiarise?
LINE 733: Have you got any jade or not?" he went on to inquire, addressing Tai-yü,
LINE 734: (to the discomfiture) of all who could not make out what he meant.
LINE 735: "It's because he has a jade himself," Tai-yü forthwith reasoned within
LINE 736: her mind, "that he asks me whether I have one or not.--No; I haven't
LINE 737: one," she replied. "That jade of yours is besides a rare object, and how
LINE 738: could every one have one?"
LINE 739: As soon as Pao-yü heard this remark, he at once burst out in a fit of
LINE 740: his raving complaint, and unclasping the gem, he dashed it disdainfully
LINE 741: on the floor. "Rare object, indeed!" he shouted, as he heaped invective
LINE 742: on it; "it has no idea how to discriminate the excellent from the mean,
LINE 743: among human beings; and do tell me, has it any perception or not? I too
LINE 744: can do without this rubbish!"
LINE 745: All those, who stood below, were startled; and in a body they pressed
LINE 746: forward, vying with each other as to who should pick up the gem.
LINE 747: Dowager lady Chia was so distressed that she clasped Pao-yü in her
LINE 748: embrace. "You child of wrath," she exclaimed. "When you get into a
LINE 749: passion, it's easy enough for you to beat and abuse people; but what
LINE 750: makes you fling away that stem of life?"
LINE 751: Pao-yü's face was covered with the traces of tears. "All my cousins
LINE 752: here, senior as well as junior," he rejoined, as he sobbed, "have no
LINE 753: gem, and if it's only I to have one, there's no fun in it, I maintain!
LINE 754: and now comes this angelic sort of cousin, and she too has none, so that
LINE 755: it's clear enough that it is no profitable thing."
LINE 756: Dowager lady Chia hastened to coax him. "This cousin of yours," she
LINE 757: explained, "would, under former circumstances, have come here with a
LINE 758: jade; and it's because your aunt felt unable, as she lay on her
LINE 759: death-bed, to reconcile herself to the separation from your cousin, that
LINE 760: in the absence of any remedy, she forthwith took the gem belonging to
LINE 761: her (daughter), along with her (in the grave); so that, in the first
LINE 762: place, by the fulfilment of the rites of burying the living with the
LINE 763: dead might be accomplished the filial piety of your cousin; and in the
LINE 764: second place, that the spirit of your aunt might also, for the time
LINE 765: being, use it to gratify the wish of gazing on your cousin. That's why
LINE 766: she simply told you that she had no jade; for she couldn't very well
LINE 767: have had any desire to give vent to self-praise. Now, how can you ever
LINE 768: compare yourself with her? and don't you yet carefully and circumspectly
LINE 769: put it on? Mind, your mother may come to know what you have done!"
LINE 770: As she uttered these words, she speedily took the jade over from the
LINE 771: hand of the waiting-maid, and she herself fastened it on for him.
LINE 772: When Pao-yü heard this explanation, he indulged in reflection, but could
LINE 773: not even then advance any further arguments.
LINE 774: A nurse came at the moment and inquired about Tai-yü's quarters, and
LINE 775: dowager lady Chia at once added, "Shift Pao-yü along with me, into the
LINE 776: warm room of my suite of apartments, and put your mistress, Miss Lin,
LINE 777: temporarily in the green gauze house; and when the rest of the winter is
LINE 778: over, and repairs are taken in hand in spring in their rooms, an
LINE 779: additional wing can be put up for her to take up her quarters in."
LINE 780: "My dear ancestor," ventured Pao-yü; "the bed I occupy outside the green
LINE 781: gauze house is very comfortable; and what need is there again for me to
LINE 782: leave it and come and disturb your old ladyship's peace and quiet?"
LINE 783: "Well, all right," observed dowager lady Chia, after some consideration;
LINE 784: "but let each one of you have a nurse, as well as a waiting-maid to
LINE 785: attend on you; the other servants can remain in the outside rooms and
LINE 786: keep night watch and be ready to answer any call."
LINE 787: At an early hour, besides, Hsi-feng had sent a servant round with a grey
LINE 788: flowered curtain, embroidered coverlets and satin quilts and other such
LINE 789: articles.
LINE 790: Tai-yü had brought along with her only two servants; the one was her own
LINE 791: nurse, dame Wang, and the other was a young waiting-maid of sixteen,
LINE 792: whose name was called Hsüeh Yen. Dowager lady Chia, perceiving that
LINE 793: Hsüeh Yen was too youthful and quite a child in her manner, while nurse
LINE 794: Wang was, on the other hand, too aged, conjectured that Tai-yü would, in
LINE 795: all her wants, not have things as she liked, so she detached two
LINE 796: waiting-maids, who were her own personal attendants, named Tzu Chüan and
LINE 797: Ying Ko, and attached them to Tai-yü's service. Just as had Ying Ch'un
LINE 798: and the other girls, each one of whom had besides the wet nurses of
LINE 799: their youth, four other nurses to advise and direct them, and exclusive
LINE 800: of two personal maids to look after their dress and toilette, four or
LINE 801: five additional young maids to do the washing and sweeping of the rooms
LINE 802: and the running about backwards and forwards on errands.
LINE 803: Nurse Wang, Tzu Chüan and other girls entered at once upon their
LINE 804: attendance on Tai-yü in the green gauze rooms, while Pao-yü's wet-nurse,
LINE 805: dame Li, together with an elderly waiting-maid, called Hsi Jen, were on
LINE 806: duty in the room with the large bed.
LINE 807: This Hsi Jen had also been, originally, one of dowager lady Chia's
LINE 808: servant-girls. Her name was in days gone by, Chen Chu. As her venerable
LINE 809: ladyship, in her tender love for Pao-yü, had feared that Pao-yü's
LINE 810: servant girls were not equal to their duties, she readily handed her to
LINE 811: Pao-yü, as she had hitherto had experience of how sincere and
LINE 812: considerate she was at heart.
LINE 813: Pao-yü, knowing that her surname was at one time Hua, and having once
LINE 814: seen in some verses of an ancient poet, the line "the fragrance of
LINE 815: flowers wafts itself into man," lost no time in explaining the fact to
LINE 816: dowager lady Chia, who at once changed her name into Hsi Jen.
LINE 817: This Hsi Jen had several simple traits. While in attendance upon dowager
LINE 818: lady Chia, in her heart and her eyes there was no one but her venerable
LINE 819: ladyship, and her alone; and now in her attendance upon Pao-yü, her
LINE 820: heart and her eyes were again full of Pao-yü, and him alone. But as
LINE 821: Pao-yü was of a perverse temperament and did not heed her repeated
LINE 822: injunctions, she felt at heart exceedingly grieved.
LINE 823: At night, after nurse Li had fallen asleep, seeing that in the inner
LINE 824: chambers, Tai-yü, Ying Ko and the others had not as yet retired to rest,
LINE 825: she disrobed herself, and with gentle step walked in.
LINE 826: "How is it, miss," she inquired smiling, "that you have not turned in as
LINE 827: yet?"
LINE 828: Tai-yü at once put on a smile. "Sit down, sister," she rejoined,
LINE 829: pressing her to take a seat. Hsi Jen sat on the edge of the bed.
LINE 830: "Miss Lin," interposed Ying Ko smirkingly, "has been here in an awful
LINE 831: state of mind! She has cried so to herself, that her eyes were flooded,
LINE 832: as soon as she dried her tears. 'It's only to-day that I've come,' she
LINE 833: said, 'and I've already been the cause of the outbreak of your young
LINE 834: master's failing. Now had he broken that jade, as he hurled it on the
LINE 835: ground, wouldn't it have been my fault? Hence it was that she was so
LINE 836: wounded at heart, that I had all the trouble in the world, before I
LINE 837: could appease her."
LINE 838: "Desist at once, Miss! Don't go on like this," Hsi Jen advised her;
LINE 839: "there will, I fear, in the future, happen things far more strange and
LINE 840: ridiculous than this; and if you allow yourself to be wounded and
LINE 841: affected to such a degree by a conduct such as his, you will, I
LINE 842: apprehend, suffer endless wounds and anguish; so be quick and dispel
LINE 843: this over-sensitive nature!"
LINE 844: "What you sisters advise me," replied Tai-yü, "I shall bear in mind, and
LINE 845: it will be all right."
LINE 846: They had another chat, which lasted for some time, before they at length
LINE 847: retired to rest for the night.
LINE 848: The next day, (she and her cousins) got up at an early hour and went
LINE 849: over to pay their respects to dowager lady Chia, after which upon coming
LINE 850: to madame Wang's apartments, they happened to find madame Wang and
LINE 851: Hsi-feng together, opening the letters which had arrived from Chin Ling.
LINE 852: There were also in the room two married women, who had been sent from
LINE 853: madame Wang's elder brother's wife's house to deliver a message.
LINE 854: Tai-yü was, it is true, not aware of what was up, but T'an Ch'un and the
LINE 855: others knew that they were discussing the son of her mother's sister,
LINE 856: married in the Hsüeh family, in the city of Chin Ling, a cousin of
LINE 857: theirs, Hsüeh P'an, who relying upon his wealth and influence had, by
LINE 858: assaulting a man, committed homicide, and who was now to be tried in the
LINE 859: court of the Ying T'ien Prefecture.
LINE 860: Her maternal uncle, Wang Tzu-t'eng, had now, on the receipt of the
LINE 861: tidings, despatched messengers to bring over the news to the Chia
LINE 862: family. But the next chapter will explain what was the ultimate issue of
LINE 863: the wish entertained in this mansion to send for the Hsüeh family to
LINE 864: come to the capital.
