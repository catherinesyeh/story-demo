LINE 1: His Majesty shows magnanimous bounty.
LINE 2: The Imperial consort Yuan pays a visit to her parents.
LINE 3: The happiness of a family gathering.
LINE 4: Pao-yü displays his polished talents.
LINE 5: But let us resume our story. A servant came, at this moment, to report
LINE 6: that for the works in course of execution, they were waiting for gauze
LINE 7: and damask silk to paste on various articles, and that they requested
LINE 8: lady Feng to go and open the depôt for them to take the gauze and silk,
LINE 9: while another servant also came to ask lady Feng to open the treasury
LINE 10: for them to receive the gold and silver ware. And as Madame Wang, the
LINE 11: waiting-maids and the other domestics of the upper rooms had all no
LINE 12: leisure, Pao-ch'ai suggested: "Don't let us remain in here and be in the
LINE 13: way of their doing what there is to be done, and of going where they
LINE 14: have to go," and saying this, she betook herself, escorted by Pao-yü and
LINE 15: the rest, into Ying Ch'un's rooms.
LINE 16: Madame Wang continued day after day in a great state of flurry and
LINE 17: confusion, straight up to within the tenth moon, by which time every
LINE 18: arrangement had been completed, and the overseers had all handed in a
LINE 19: clear statement of their accounts. The curios and writing materials,
LINE 20: wherever needed, had all already been laid out and everything got ready,
LINE 21: and the birds (and animals), from the stork, the deer and rabbits to the
LINE 22: chickens, geese and the like, had all been purchased and handed over to
LINE 23: be reared in the various localities in the garden; and over at Chia
LINE 24: Se's, had also been learnt twenty miscellaneous plays, while a company
LINE 25: of young nuns and Taoist priestesses had likewise the whole number of
LINE 26: them, mastered the intonation of Buddhist classics and incantations.
LINE 27: Chia Cheng after this, at length, was slightly composed in mind, and
LINE 28: cheerful at heart; and having further invited dowager lady Chia and
LINE 29: other inmates to go into the garden, he deliberated with them on, and
LINE 30: made arrangements for, every detail in such a befitting manner that not
LINE 31: the least trifle remained for which suitable provision had not been
LINE 32: made; and Chia Cheng eventually mustered courage to indite a memorial,
LINE 33: and on the very day on which the memorial was presented, a decree was
LINE 34: received fixing upon the fifteenth day of the first moon of the ensuing
LINE 35: year, the very day of the Shang Yuan festival, for the honourable
LINE 36: consorts to visit their homes.
LINE 37: Upon the receipt of this decree, with which the Chia family was
LINE 38: honoured, they had still less leisure, both by day as well as by night;
LINE 39: so much so that they could not even properly observe the new year
LINE 40: festivities. But in a twinkle of the eye, the festival of the full moon
LINE 41: of the first moon drew near; and beginning from the eighth day of the
LINE 42: first moon, eunuchs issued from the palace and inspected beforehand the
LINE 43: various localities, the apartments in which the imperial consort was to
LINE 44: change her costume; the place where she would spend her leisure moments;
LINE 45: the spot where she would receive the conventionalities; the premises
LINE 46: where the banquets would be spread; the quarters where she would retire
LINE 47: for rest.
LINE 48: There were also eunuchs who came to assume the patrol of the grounds and
LINE 49: the direction of the defences; and they brought along with them a good
LINE 50: many minor eunuchs, whose duty it was to look after the safety of the
LINE 51: various localities, to screen the place with enclosing curtains, to
LINE 52: instruct the inmates and officials of the Chia mansion whither to go out
LINE 53: and whence to come in from, what side the viands should be brought in
LINE 54: from, where to report matters, and in the observance of every kind of
LINE 55: etiquette; and for outside the mansion, there were, on the other hand,
LINE 56: officers from the Board of Works, and a superintendent of the Police, of
LINE 57: the "Five Cities," in charge of the sweeping of the streets and roads,
LINE 58: and the clearing away of loungers. While Chia She and the others
LINE 59: superintended the workmen in such things as the manufacture of flowered
LINE 60: lanterns and fireworks.
LINE 61: The fourteenth day arrived and everything was in order; but on this
LINE 62: night, one and all whether high or low, did not get a wink of sleep; and
LINE 63: when the fifteenth came, every one, at the fifth watch, beginning from
LINE 64: dowager lady Chia and those who enjoyed any official status, appeared in
LINE 65: full gala dress, according to their respective ranks. In the garden, the
LINE 66: curtains were, by this time, flapping like dragons, the portieres flying
LINE 67: about like phoenixes with variegated plumage. Gold and silver glistened
LINE 68: with splendour. Pearls and precious gems shed out their brilliant
LINE 69: lustre. The tripod censers burnt the Pai-ho incense. In the vases were
LINE 70: placed evergreens. Silence and stillness prevailed, and not a man
LINE 71: ventured so much as to cough.
LINE 72: Chia She and the other men were standing outside the door giving on to
LINE 73: the street on the west; and old lady Chia and the other ladies were
LINE 74: outside the main entrance of the Jung mansion at the head of the street,
LINE 75: while at the mouth of the lane were placed screens to rigorously
LINE 76: obstruct the public gaze. They were unable to bear the fatigue of any
LINE 77: further waiting when, at an unexpected moment, a eunuch arrived on
LINE 78: horseback, and Chia Cheng went up to meet him, and ascertained what
LINE 79: tidings he was the bearer of.
LINE 80: "It's as yet far too early," rejoined the eunuch, "for at one o'clock
LINE 81: (her highness) will have her evening repast, and at two she has to
LINE 82: betake herself to the Palace of Precious Perception to worship Buddha.
LINE 83: At five, she will enter the Palace of Great Splendour to partake of a
LINE 84: banquet, and to see the lanterns, after which, she will request His
LINE 85: Majesty's permission; so that, I'm afraid, it won't be earlier than
LINE 86: seven before they set out."
LINE 87: Lady Feng's ear caught what was said. "If such be the case," she
LINE 88: interposed, "may it please your venerable ladyship, and you, my lady, to
LINE 89: return for a while to your apartments, and wait; and if you come when
LINE 90: it's time you'll be here none too late."
LINE 91: Dowager lady Chia and the other ladies immediately left for a time and
LINE 92: suited their own convenience, and as everything in the garden devolved
LINE 93: upon lady Feng to supervise, she ordered the butlers to take the eunuchs
LINE 94: and give them something to eat and drink; and at the same time, she sent
LINE 95: word that candles should be brought in and that the lanterns in the
LINE 96: various places should be lit.
LINE 97: But unexpectedly was heard from outside the continuous patter of horses
LINE 98: running, whereupon about ten eunuchs hurried in gasping and out of
LINE 99: breath. They clapped their hands, and the several eunuchs (who had come
LINE 100: before), understanding the signal, and knowing that the party had
LINE 101: arrived, stood in their respective positions; while Chia She, at the
LINE 102: head of all the men of the clan, remained at the western street door,
LINE 103: and dowager lady Chia, at the head of the female relatives of the
LINE 104: family, waited outside the principal entrance to do the honours.
LINE 105: For a long interval, everything was plunged in silence and quiet; when
LINE 106: suddenly two eunuchs on horseback were espied advancing with leisurely
LINE 107: step. Reaching the western street gate, they dismounted, and, driving
LINE 108: their horses beyond the screens, they forthwith took their stand facing
LINE 109: the west. After another long interval, a second couple arrived, and went
LINE 110: likewise through the same proceedings. In a short time, drew near about
LINE 111: ten couples, when, at length, were heard the gentle strains of music,
LINE 112: and couple by couple advanced with banners, dragons, with fans made with
LINE 113: phoenix feathers, and palace flabella of pheasant plumes; and those
LINE 114: besides who carried gold-washed censers burning imperial incense. Next
LINE 115: in order was brought past a state umbrella of golden yellow, with
LINE 116: crooked handle and embroidered with seven phoenixes; after which quickly
LINE 117: followed the crown, robe, girdle and shoes.
LINE 118: There were likewise eunuchs, who took a part in the procession, holding
LINE 119: scented handkerchiefs and embroidered towels, cups for rinsing the
LINE 120: mouth, dusters and other such objects; and company after company went
LINE 121: past, when, at the rear, approached with stately step eight eunuchs
LINE 122: carrying an imperial sedan chair, of golden yellow, with a gold knob and
LINE 123: embroidered with phoenixes.
LINE 124: Old lady Chia and the other members of the family hastily fell on their
LINE 125: knees, but a eunuch came over at once to raise her ladyship and the
LINE 126: rest; and the imperial chair was thereupon carried through the main
LINE 127: entrance, the ceremonial gate and into a court on the eastern side, at
LINE 128: the door of which stood a eunuch, who prostrated himself and invited
LINE 129: (her highness) to dismount and change her costume.
LINE 130: Having forthwith carried her inside the gate, the eunuchs dispersed; and
LINE 131: only the maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting ushered Yuan Ch'un out of
LINE 132: the chair, when what mainly attracted her eye in the park was the
LINE 133: brilliant lustre of the flowered lamps of every colour, all of which
LINE 134: were made of gauze or damask, and were beautiful in texture, and out of
LINE 135: the common run; while on the upper side was a flat lantern with the
LINE 136: inscription in four characters, "Regarded (by His Majesty's) benevolence
LINE 137: and permeated by his benefits."
LINE 138: Yuan Ch'un entered the apartment and effected the necessary changes in
LINE 139: her toilette; after which, she again egressed, and, mounting her chair,
LINE 140: she made her entry into the garden, when she perceived the smoke of
LINE 141: incense whirling and twirling, and the reflection of the flowers
LINE 142: confusing the eyes. Far and wide, the rays of light, shed by the
LINE 143: lanterns, intermingled their brilliancy, while, from time to time, fine
LINE 144: strains of music sounded with clamorous din. But it would be impossible
LINE 145: to express adequately the perfect harmony in the aspect of this scene,
LINE 146: and the grandeur of affluence and splendour.
LINE 147: The imperial consort of the Chia family, we must now observe, upon
LINE 148: catching sight, from the interior of her chair, of the picture presented
LINE 149: within as well as without the confines of this garden, shook her head
LINE 150: and heaved a sigh. "What lavish extravagance! What excessive waste!" she
LINE 151: soliloquised.
LINE 152: But of a sudden was again seen a eunuch who, on his knees, invited her
LINE 153: to get into a boat; and the Chia consort descended from the chair and
LINE 154: stepped into the craft, when the expanse of a limpid stream met her
LINE 155: gaze, whose grandeur resembled that of the dragon in its listless
LINE 156: course. The stone bannisters, on each side, were one mass of air-tight
LINE 157: lanterns, of every colour, made of crystal or glass, which threw out a
LINE 158: light like the lustre of silver or the brightness of snow.
LINE 159: The willow, almond and the whole lot of trees, on the upper side, were,
LINE 160: it is true, without blossom and leaves; but pongee and damask silks,
LINE 161: paper and lustring had been employed, together with rice-paper, to make
LINE 162: flowers of, which had been affixed on the branches. Upon each tree were
LINE 163: suspended thousands of lanterns; and what is more, the lotus and aquatic
LINE 164: plants, the ducks and water fowl in the pond had all, in like manner,
LINE 165: been devised out of conches and clams, plumes and feathers. The various
LINE 166: lanterns, above and below, vied in refulgence. In real truth, it was a
LINE 167: crystal region, a world of pearls and precious stones. On board the boat
LINE 168: were also every kind of lanterns representing such designs as are used
LINE 169: on flower-pots, pearl-laden portieres, embroidered curtains, oars of
LINE 170: cinnamon wood, and paddles of magnolia, which need not of course be
LINE 171: minutely described.
LINE 172: They entered a landing with a stone curb; and on this landing was
LINE 173: erected a flat lantern upon which were plainly visible the four
LINE 174: characters the "Persicary beach and flower-laden bank." But, reader, you
LINE 175: have heard how that these four characters "the persicary beach and the
LINE 176: flower-laden bank," the motto "a phoenix comes with dignified air," and
LINE 177: the rest owe one and all their origin to the unexpected test to which
LINE 178: Chia Cheng submitted, on a previous occasion, Pao-yü's literary
LINE 179: abilities; but how did it come about that they were actually adopted?
LINE 180: You must remember that the Chia family had been, generation after
LINE 181: generation, given to the study of letters, so that it was only natural
LINE 182: that there should be among them one or two renowned writers of verses;
LINE 183: for how could they ever resemble the families of such upstarts, who only
LINE 184: employ puerile expressions as a makeshift to get through what they have
LINE 185: to do? But the why and the wherefore must be sought in the past. The
LINE 186: consort, belonging to the Chia mansion, had, before she entered the
LINE 187: palace, been, from her infancy, also brought up by dowager lady Chia;
LINE 188: and when Pao-yü was subsequently added to the family, she was the eldest
LINE 189: sister and Pao-yü the youngest child. The Chia consort, bearing in mind
LINE 190: how that she had, when her mother was verging on old age, at length
LINE 191: obtained this younger brother, she for this reason doated upon him with
LINE 192: single love; and as they were besides companions in their attendance
LINE 193: upon old lady Chia, they were inseparable for even a moment. Before
LINE 194: Pao-yü had entered school, and when three or four years of age, he had
LINE 195: already received oral instruction from the imperial spouse Chia from the
LINE 196: contents of several books and had committed to memory several thousands
LINE 197: of characters, for though they were only sister and brother, they were
LINE 198: like mother and child. And after she had entered the Palace, she was
LINE 199: wont time and again to have letters taken out to her father and her
LINE 200: cousins, urgently recommending them to be careful with his bringing up,
LINE 201: that if they were not strict, he could not possibly become good for
LINE 202: anything, and that if they were immoderately severe, there was the
LINE 203: danger of something unpropitious befalling him, with the result,
LINE 204: moreover, that his grandmother would be stricken with sorrow; and this
LINE 205: solicitude on his account was never for an instant lost sight of by her.
LINE 206: Hence it was that Chia Cheng having, a few days back, heard his teacher
LINE 207: extol him for his extreme abilities, he forthwith put him to the test on
LINE 208: the occasion of their ramble through the garden. And though (his
LINE 209: compositions) were not in the bold style of a writer of note, yet they
LINE 210: were productions of their own family, and would, moreover, be
LINE 211: instrumental, when the Chia consort had her notice attracted by them,
LINE 212: and come to know that they were devised by her beloved brother, in also
LINE 213: not rendering nugatory the anxious interest which she had ever
LINE 214: entertained on his behalf, and he, therefore, purposely adopted what had
LINE 215: been suggested by Pao-yü; while for those places, for which on that day
LINE 216: no devices had been completed, a good number were again subsequently
LINE 217: composed to make up what was wanted.
LINE 218: After the Chia consort had, for we shall now return to her, perused the
LINE 219: four characters, she gave a smile. "The two words 'flower-laden bank,'"
LINE 220: she said, "are really felicitous, so what use was there for 'persicary
LINE 221: beach?'"
LINE 222: When the eunuch in waiting heard this observation, he promptly jumped
LINE 223: off the craft on to the bank, and at a flying pace hurried to
LINE 224: communicate it to Chia Cheng, and Chia Cheng instantly effected the
LINE 225: necessary alteration.
LINE 226: By this time the craft had reached the inner bank, and leaving the boat,
LINE 227: and mounting into her sedan chair, she in due course contemplated the
LINE 228: magnificent Jade-like Palace; the Hall of cinnamon wood, lofty and
LINE 229: sublime; and the marble portals with the four characters in bold style:
LINE 230: the "Precious confines of heavenly spirits," which the Chia consort gave
LINE 231: directions should be changed for the four words denoting: "additional
LINE 232: Hall (for the imperial consort) on a visit to her parents." And
LINE 233: forthwith making her entrance into the travelling lodge her gaze was
LINE 234: attracted by torches burning in the court encompassing the heavens,
LINE 235: fragments of incense strewn on the ground, fire-like trees and gem-like
LINE 236: flowers, gold-like windows and jade-like bannisters. But it would be
LINE 237: difficult to give a full account of the curtains, which rolled up (as
LINE 238: fine as a) shrimp's moustache; of the carpets of other skins spread on
LINE 239: the floor; of the tripods exhaling the fragrant aroma of the brain of
LINE 240: the musk deer; of the screens in a row resembling fans made of pheasant
LINE 241: tails. Indeed, the gold-like doors and the windows like jade were
LINE 242: suggestive of the abode of spirits; while the halls made of cinnamon
LINE 243: wood and the palace of magnolia timber, of the very homes of the
LINE 244: imperial secondary consorts.
LINE 245: "Why is it," the Chia consort inquired, "that there is no tablet in this
LINE 246: Hall?"
LINE 247: The eunuch in waiting fell on his knees. "This is the main Hall," he
LINE 248: reverently replied, "and the officials, outside the palace, did not
LINE 249: presume to take upon themselves to suggest any motto."
LINE 250: The Chia consort shook her head and said not a word; whereupon the
LINE 251: eunuch, who acted as master of ceremonies, requested Her Majesty to
LINE 252: ascend the throne and receive homage. The band stationed on the two
LINE 253: flights of steps struck up a tune, while two eunuchs ushered Chia She,
LINE 254: Chia Cheng and the other members on to the moonlike stage, where they
LINE 255: arranged themselves in order and ascended into the hall, but when the
LINE 256: ladies-in-waiting transmitted her commands that the homage could be
LINE 257: dispensed with, they at once retraced their footsteps.
LINE 258: (The master of the ceremonies), in like manner led forward the dowager
LINE 259: lady of the Jung Kuo mansion, as well as the female relatives, from the
LINE 260: steps on the east side, on to the moon-like stage; where they were
LINE 261: placed according to their ranks. But the maids-of-honour again commanded
LINE 262: that they should dispense with the ceremony, so they likewise promptly
LINE 263: withdrew.
LINE 264: After tea had been thrice presented, the Chia consort descended the
LINE 265: Throne, and the music ceased. She retired into a side room to change her
LINE 266: costume, and the private chairs were then got ready for her visit to her
LINE 267: parents. Issuing from the garden, she came into the main quarters
LINE 268: belonging to dowager lady Chia, where she was bent upon observing the
LINE 269: domestic conventionalities, when her venerable ladyship, and the other
LINE 270: members of the family, prostrated themselves in a body before her, and
LINE 271: made her desist. Tears dropped down from the eyes of the Chia consort as
LINE 272: (she and her relatives) mutually came forward, and greeted each other,
LINE 273: and as with one hand she grasped old lady Chia, and with the other she
LINE 274: held madame Wang, the three had plenty in their hearts which they were
LINE 275: fain to speak about; but, unable as each one of them was to give
LINE 276: utterance to their feelings, all they did was to sob and to weep, as
LINE 277: they kept face to face to each other; while madame Hsing, widow Li Wan,
LINE 278: Wang Hsi-feng, and the three sisters: Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi
LINE 279: Ch'un, stood aside in a body shedding tears and saying not a word.
LINE 280: After a long time, the Chia consort restrained her anguish, and forcing
LINE 281: a smile, she set to work to reassure old lady Chia and madame Wang.
LINE 282: "Having in days gone by," she urged, "been sent to that place where no
LINE 283: human being can be seen, I have to-day after extreme difficulty returned
LINE 284: home; and now that you ladies and I have been reunited, instead of
LINE 285: chatting or laughing we contrariwise give way to incessant tears! But
LINE 286: shortly, I shall be gone, and who knows when we shall be able again to
LINE 287: even see each other!"
LINE 288: When she came to this sentence, they could not help bursting into
LINE 289: another tit of crying; and Madame Hsing hastened to come forward, and to
LINE 290: console dowager lady Chia and the rest. But when the Chia consort
LINE 291: resumed her seat, and one by one came again, in turn, to exchange
LINE 292: salutations, they could not once more help weeping and sobbing for a
LINE 293: time.
LINE 294: Next in order, were the managers and servants of the eastern and western
LINE 295: mansions to perform their obeisance in the outer pavilion; and after the
LINE 296: married women and waiting-maids had concluded their homage, the Chia
LINE 297: consort heaved a sigh. "How many relatives," she observed, "there are
LINE 298: all of whom, alas! I may not see."
LINE 299: "There are here now," madame Wang rejoined with due respect, "kindred
LINE 300: with outside family names, such as Mrs. Hsüeh, née Wang, Pao-ch'ai, and
LINE 301: Tai-yü waiting for your commands; but as they are distant relatives, and
LINE 302: without official status, they do not venture to arrogate to themselves
LINE 303: the right of entering into your presence." But the Chia consort issued
LINE 304: directions that they should be invited to come that they should see each
LINE 305: other; and in a short while, Mrs. Hsüeh and the other relatives walked
LINE 306: in, but as they were on the point of performing the rites, prescribed by
LINE 307: the state, she bade them relinquish the observance so that they came
LINE 308: forward, and each, in turn, alluded to what had transpired during the
LINE 309: long separation.
LINE 310: Pao Ch'in also and a few other waiting-maids, whom the Chia consort had
LINE 311: originally taken along with her into the palace, knocked their heads
LINE 312: before dowager lady Chia, but her ladyship lost no time in raising them
LINE 313: up, and in bidding them go into a separate suite of rooms to be
LINE 314: entertained; and as for the retainers, eunuchs as well as
LINE 315: maids-of-honour, ladies-in-waiting and every attendant, there were
LINE 316: needless to say, those in the two places, the Ning mansion and Chia
LINE 317: She's residence, to wait upon them; there only remained three or four
LINE 318: young eunuchs to answer the summons.
LINE 319: The mother and daughter and her cousins conversed for some time on what
LINE 320: had happened during the protracted separation, as well as on domestic
LINE 321: affairs and their private feelings, when Chia Cheng likewise advanced as
LINE 322: far as the other side of the portiere, and inquired after her health,
LINE 323: and the Chia consort from inside performed the homage and other
LINE 324: conventionalities (due to her parent).
LINE 325: "The families of farmers," she further went on to say to her father,
LINE 326: "feed on salted cabbage, and clothe in cotton material; but they readily
LINE 327: enjoy the happiness of the relationships established by heaven! We,
LINE 328: however, relatives though we now be of one bone and flesh, are, with all
LINE 329: our affluence and honours, living apart from each other, and deriving no
LINE 330: happiness whatsoever!"
LINE 331: Chia Cheng, on his part endeavoured, to restrain his tears. "I
LINE 332: belonged," he rejoined, "to a rustic and poor family; and among that
LINE 333: whole number of pigeons and pheasants, how could I have imagined that I
LINE 334: would have obtained the blessing of a hidden phoenix! Of late all for
LINE 335: the sake of your honourable self, His Majesty, above, confers upon us
LINE 336: his heavenly benefits; while we, below, show forth the virtue of our
LINE 337: ancestors! And it is mainly because the vital principle of the hills,
LINE 338: streams, sun, and moon, and the remote virtue of our ancestors have been
LINE 339: implanted in you alone that this good fortune has attained me Cheng and
LINE 340: my wife! Moreover, the present emperor, bearing in mind the great bounty
LINE 341: shewn by heaven and earth in promoting a ceaseless succession, has
LINE 342: vouchsafed a more generous act of grace than has ever been displayed
LINE 343: from old days to the present. And although we may besmear our liver and
LINE 344: brain in the mire, how could we show our gratitude, even to so slight a
LINE 345: degree as one ten-thousandth part. But all I can do is, in the daytime,
LINE 346: to practise diligence, vigilance at night, and loyalty in my official
LINE 347: duties. My humble wish is that His Majesty, my master, may live ten
LINE 348: thousand years and see thousands of autumns, so as to promote the
LINE 349: welfare of all mankind in the world! And you, worthy imperial consort,
LINE 350: must, on no account, be mindful of me Cheng and my wife, decrepid as we
LINE 351: are in years. What I would solicit more than anything is that you should
LINE 352: be more careful of yourself, and that you should be diligent and
LINE 353: reverential in your service to His Majesty, with the intent that you may
LINE 354: not prove ungrateful of his affectionate regard and bountiful grace."
LINE 355: The Chia consort, on the other hand, enjoined "that much as it was
LINE 356: expedient to display zeal, in the management of state matters, it
LINE 357: behoved him, when he had any leisure, to take good care of himself, and
LINE 358: that he should not, whatever he did, give way to solicitude on her
LINE 359: behalf." And Chia Cheng then went on to say "that the various
LINE 360: inscriptions in the park over the pavilions, terraces, halls and
LINE 361: residences had been all composed by Pao-yü, and, that in the event of
LINE 362: there being one or two that could claim her attention, he would be happy
LINE 363: if it would please her to at once favour him with its name." Whereupon
LINE 364: the imperial consort Yüan, when she heard that Pao-yü could compose
LINE 365: verses, forthwith exclaimed with a smile: "He has in very truth made
LINE 366: progress!"
LINE 367: After Chia Cheng had retired out of the hall, the Chia consort made it a
LINE 368: point to ask: "How is it that I do not see Pao-yü?" and dowager lady
LINE 369: Chia explained: "An outside male relative as he is, and without official
LINE 370: rank, he does not venture to appear before you of his own accord."
LINE 371: "Bring him in!" the imperial consort directed; whereupon a young eunuch
LINE 372: ushered Pao-yü in. After he had first complied with the state
LINE 373: ceremonies, she bade him draw near to her, and taking his hand, she held
LINE 374: it in her lap, and, as she went on to caress his head and neck, she
LINE 375: smiled and said: "He's grown considerably taller than he was before;"
LINE 376: but she had barely concluded this remark, when her tears ran down as
LINE 377: profuse as rain. Mrs. Yu, lady Feng, and the rest pressed forward. "The
LINE 378: banquet is quite ready," they announced, "and your highness is requested
LINE 379: to favour the place with your presence."
LINE 380: The imperial consort Yuan stood up and asking Pao-yü to lead the way,
LINE 381: she followed in his steps, along with the whole party, and betook
LINE 382: herself on foot as far as the entrance of the garden gate, whence she at
LINE 383: once espied, in the lustre shed by the lanterns, every kind of
LINE 384: decorations. Entering the garden, they first passed the spots with the
LINE 385: device "a phoenix comes with dignified air," "the red (flowers are)
LINE 386: fragrant and the green (banana leaves like) jade!" "the sign on the
LINE 387: apricot tree is visible," "the fragrance pure of the ligularia and
LINE 388: iris," and other places; and ascending the towers they walked up the
LINE 389: halls, forded the streams and wound round the hills; contemplating as
LINE 390: they turned their gaze from side to side, each place arranged in a
LINE 391: different style, and each kind of article laid out in unique designs.
LINE 392: The Chia consort expressed her admiration in most profuse eulogiums, and
LINE 393: then went on to advise them: "that it was not expedient to indulge in
LINE 394: future in such excessive extravagance and that all these arrangements
LINE 395: were over and above what should have been done."
LINE 396: Presently they reached the main pavilion, where she commanded that they
LINE 397: could dispense with the rites and take their seats. A sumptuous banquet
LINE 398: was laid out, at which dowager lady Chia and the other ladies occupied
LINE 399: the lower seats and entertained each other, while Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan,
LINE 400: lady Feng and the rest presented the soup and handed the cups. The
LINE 401: Imperial consort Yuan subsequently directed that the pencils and
LINE 402: inkslabs should be brought, and with her own hands she opened the silken
LINE 403: paper. She chose the places she liked, and conferred upon them a name;
LINE 404: and devising a general designation for the garden, she called it the Ta
LINE 405: Kuan garden (Broad vista), while for the tablet of the main pavilion the
LINE 406: device she composed ran as follows: "Be mindful of the grace and
LINE 407: remember the equity (of His Majesty);" with this inscription on the
LINE 408: antithetical scrolls:
LINE 409: Mercy excessive Heaven and earth display,
LINE 410: And it men young and old hail gratefully;
LINE 411: From old till now they pour their bounties great
LINE 412: Those rich gifts which Cathay and all states permeate.
LINE 413: Changing also the text: "A phoenix comes with dignified air for the
LINE 414: Hsiao Hsiang Lodge."
LINE 415: "The red (flowers are) fragrant and the green (banana leaves like)
LINE 416: jade," she altered into "Happy red and joyful green"; bestowing upon the
LINE 417: place the appellation of the I Hung court (joyful red). The spot where
LINE 418: "the fragrance pure of the ligularia and iris," was inscribed, she
LINE 419: called "the ligularia and the 'Wu' weed court;" and where was "the sign
LINE 420: in the apricot tree is visible," she designated "the cottage in the
LINE 421: hills where dolichos is bleached." The main tower she called the Broad
LINE 422: Vista Tower. The lofty tower facing the east, she designated "the
LINE 423: variegated and flowery Hall;" bestowing on the line of buildings, facing
LINE 424: the west, the appellation of "the Hall of Occult Fragrance;" and besides
LINE 425: these figured such further names as: "the Hall of peppery wind," "the
LINE 426: Arbour of lotus fragrance," "the Islet of purple caltrop," "the Bank of
LINE 427: golden lotus," and the like. There were also tablets with four
LINE 428: characters such as: "the peach blossom and the vernal rain;" "the
LINE 429: autumnal wind prunes the Eloecocca," "the artemisia leaves and the night
LINE 430: snow," and other similar names which could not all be placed on record.
LINE 431: She furthermore directed that such tablets as were already put up,
LINE 432: should not be dismounted, and she forthwith took the lead and composed
LINE 433: an heptameter stanza, the burden of which was:
LINE 434: Hills it enclasps, embraces streams, with skill it is laid out:
LINE 435: What task the grounds to raise! the works to start and bring about!
LINE 436: Of scenery in heaven and amongst men store has been made;
LINE 437: The name Broad Vista o'er the fragrant park should be engraved.
LINE 438: When she had finished writing, she observed smilingly, as she addressed
LINE 439: herself to all the young ladies: "I have all along lacked the quality of
LINE 440: sharpness and never besides been good at verses; as you, sisters, and
LINE 441: all of you have ever been aware; but, on a night like this I've been
LINE 442: fain to do my best, with the object of escaping censure, and of not
LINE 443: reflecting injustice on this scenery and nothing more. But some other
LINE 444: day when I've got time, be it ever so little, I shall deem it my duty to
LINE 445: make up what remains by inditing a record of the Broad Vista Garden, as
LINE 446: well as a song on my visit to my parents and other such literary
LINE 447: productions in memory of the events of this day. You sisters and others
LINE 448: must, each of you, in like manner compose a stanza on the motto on each
LINE 449: tablet, expressing your sentiments, as you please, without being
LINE 450: restrained by any regard for my meagre ability. Knowing as I do besides
LINE 451: that Pao-yü is, indeed, able to write verses, I feel the more delighted!
LINE 452: But among his compositions, those I like the best are those in the two
LINE 453: places, 'the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge,' and 'the court of Heng and Wu;' and
LINE 454: next those of 'the Joyful red court,' and 'the cottage in the hills,
LINE 455: where the dolichos is bleached.' As for grand sites like these four,
LINE 456: there should be found some out-of-the-way expressions to insert in the
LINE 457: verses so that they should be felicitous. The antithetical lines
LINE 458: composed by you, (Pao-yü), on a former occasion are excellent, it is
LINE 459: true; but you should now further indite for each place, a pentameter
LINE 460: stanza, so that by allowing me to test you in my presence, you may not
LINE 461: show yourself ungrateful for the trouble I have taken in teaching you
LINE 462: from your youth up."
LINE 463: Pao-yü had no help but to assent, and descending from the hall, he went
LINE 464: off all alone to give himself up to reflection.
LINE 465: Of the three Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, T'an Ch'un must be
LINE 466: considered to have also been above the standard of her sisters, but she,
LINE 467: in her own estimation, imagined it, in fact, difficult to compete with
LINE 468: Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-yü. With no alternative however than that of
LINE 469: doing her best, she followed the example of all the rest with the sole
LINE 470: purpose of warding off criticism. And Li Wan too succeeded, after much
LINE 471: exertion, in putting together a stanza.
LINE 472: The consort of the Chia family perused in due order the verses written
LINE 473: by the young ladies, the text of which is given below.
LINE 474: The lines written by Ying Ch'un on the tablet of "Boundless spirits and
LINE 475: blissful heart" were:
LINE 476: A park laid out with scenery surpassing fine and rare!
LINE 477: Submissive to thy will, on boundless bliss bashful I write!
LINE 478: Who could believe that yonder scenes in this world found a share!
LINE 479: Will not thy heart be charmed on thy visit by the sight?
LINE 480: These are the verses by T'an Ch'un on the tablet of "All nature vies in
LINE 481: splendour":
LINE 482: Of aspect lofty and sublime is raised a park of fame!
LINE 483: Honoured with thy bequest, my shallow lore fills me with shame.
LINE 484: No words could e'er amply exhaust the beauteous skill,
LINE 485: For lo! in very truth glory and splendour all things fill!
LINE 486: Thus runs Hsi Ch'un's stanza on the tablet of the "Conception of
LINE 487: literary compositions":
LINE 488: The hillocks and the streams crosswise beyond a thousand li extend!
LINE 489: The towers and terraces 'midst the five-coloured clouds lofty ascend!
LINE 490: In the resplendent radiance of both sun and moon the park it lies!
LINE 491: The skill these scenes to raise the skill e'en essays to conceive
LINE 492: outvies!
LINE 493: The lines composed by Li Wan on the tablet "grace and elegance,"
LINE 494: consisted of:
LINE 495: The comely streams and hillocks clear, in double folds, embrace;
LINE 496: E'en Fairyland, forsooth, transcend they do in elegance and grace!
LINE 497: The "Fragrant Plant" the theme is of the ballad fan, green-made.
LINE 498: Like drooping plum-bloom flap the lapel red and the Hsiang gown.
LINE 499: From prosperous times must have been handed down those pearls and
LINE 500: jade.
LINE 501: What bliss! the fairy on the jasper terrace will come down!
LINE 502: When to our prayers she yields, this glorious park to contemplate,
LINE 503: No mortal must e'er be allowed these grounds to penetrate.
LINE 504: The ode by Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai on the tablet of "Concentrated Splendour and
LINE 505: Accumulated auspiciousness" was:
LINE 506: Raised on the west of the Imperial city, lo! the park stored with
LINE 507: fragrant smell,
LINE 508: Shrouded by Phoebe's radiant rays and clouds of good omen, in wondrous
LINE 509: glory lies!
LINE 510: The willows tall with joy exult that the parrots their nests have
LINE 511: shifted from the dell.
LINE 512: The bamboo groves, when laid, for the phoenix with dignity to come,
LINE 513: were meant to rise.
LINE 514: The very eve before the Empress' stroll, elegant texts were ready and
LINE 515: affixed.
LINE 516: If even she her parents comes to see, how filial piety supreme must
LINE 517: be!
LINE 518: When I behold her beauteous charms and talents supernatural, with awe
LINE 519: transfixed,
LINE 520: One word, to utter more how can I troth ever presume, when shame
LINE 521: overpowers me.
LINE 522: The distich by Lin Tai-yü on the tablet of "Spiritual stream outside the
LINE 523: world," ran thus:
LINE 524: Th' imperial visit doth enhance joy and delight.
LINE 525: This fairy land from mortal scenes what diff'rent sight!
LINE 526: The comely grace it borrows of both hill and stream;
LINE 527: And to the landscape it doth add a charm supreme.
LINE 528: The fumes of Chin Ku wine everything permeate;
LINE 529: The flowers the inmate of the Jade Hall fascinate.
LINE 530: The imperial favour to receive how blessed our lot!
LINE 531: For oft the palace carriage will pass through this spot.
LINE 532: The Chia consort having concluded the perusal of the verses, and
LINE 533: extolled them for a time: "After all," she went on to say with a smile,
LINE 534: "those composed by my two cousins, Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai and Lin Tai-yü,
LINE 535: differ in excellence from those of all the rest; and neither I, stupid
LINE 536: as I am, nor my sisters can attain their standard."
LINE 537: Lin Tao-yü had, in point of fact, made up her mind to display, on this
LINE 538: evening, her extraordinary abilities to their best advantage, and to put
LINE 539: down every one else, but contrary to her expectations the Chia consort
LINE 540: had expressed her desire that no more than a single stanza should be
LINE 541: written on each tablet, so that unable, after all, to disregard her
LINE 542: directions by writing anything in excess, she had no help but to compose
LINE 543: a pentameter stanza, in an offhand way, merely with the intent of
LINE 544: complying with her wishes.
LINE 545: Pao-yü had by this time not completed his task. He had just finished two
LINE 546: stanzas on the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge and the Heng Wu garden, and was just
LINE 547: then engaged in composing a verse on the "Happy red Court." In his draft
LINE 548: figured a line: "The (leaves) of jade-like green in spring are yet
LINE 549: rolled up," which Pao-ch'ai stealthily observed as she turned her eyes
LINE 550: from side to side; and availing herself of the very first moment, when
LINE 551: none of the company could notice her, she gave him a nudge. "As her
LINE 552: highness," she remarked, "doesn't relish the four characters,
LINE 553: representing the red (flowers are) fragrant, and the green (banana
LINE 554: leaves) like jade, she changed them, just a while back, for 'the joyful
LINE 555: red and gladsome green;' and if you deliberately now again employ these
LINE 556: two words 'jade-like green,' won't it look as if you were bent upon
LINE 557: being at variance with her? Besides, very many are the old books, in
LINE 558: which the banana leaves form the theme, so you had better think of
LINE 559: another line and substitute it and have done with it!"
LINE 560: When Pao-yü heard the suggestion made by Pao-ch'ai, he speedily replied,
LINE 561: as he wiped off the perspiration: "I can't at all just at present call
LINE 562: to mind any passage from the contents of some old book."
LINE 563: "Just simply take," proposed Pao-ch'ai smilingly, "the character jade in
LINE 564: jade-like green and change it into the character wax, that's all."
LINE 565: "Does 'green wax,'" Pao-yü inquired, "come out from anywhere?"
LINE 566: Pao-ch'ai gently smacked her lips and nodded her head as she laughed. "I
LINE 567: fear," she said, "that if, on an occasion like to-night, you show no
LINE 568: more brains than this, by and by when you have to give any answers in
LINE 569: the golden hall, to the questions (of the examiner), you will, really,
LINE 570: forget (the very first four names) of Chao, Oh'ien, Sun and Li (out of
LINE 571: the hundred)! What, have you so much as forgotten the first line of the
LINE 572: poem by Han Yü, of the T'ang dynasty, on the Banana leaf:
LINE 573: "Cold is the candle and without a flame, the green wax dry?"
LINE 574: On hearing these words, Pao-yü's mind suddenly became enlightened. "What
LINE 575: a fool I am!" he added with a simper; "I couldn't for the moment even
LINE 576: remember the lines, ready-made though they were and staring at me in my
LINE 577: very eyes! Sister, you really can be styled my teacher, little though
LINE 578: you may have taught me, and I'll henceforward address you by no other
LINE 579: name than 'teacher,' and not call you 'sister' any more!"
LINE 580: "Don't you yet hurry to go on," Pao-ch'ai again observed in a gentle
LINE 581: tone of voice sneeringly, "but keep on calling me elder sister and
LINE 582: younger sister? Who's your sister? that one over there in a yellow coat
LINE 583: is your sister!"
LINE 584: But apprehending, as she bandied these jokes, lest she might be wasting
LINE 585: his time, she felt constrained to promptly move away; whereupon Pao-yü
LINE 586: continued the ode he had been working at, and brought it to a close,
LINE 587: writing in all three stanzas.
LINE 588: Tai-yü had not had so far an opportunity of making a display of her
LINE 589: ability, and was feeling at heart in a very dejected mood; but when she
LINE 590: perceived that Pao-yü was having intense trouble in conceiving what he
LINE 591: had to write, and she found, upon walking up to the side of the table,
LINE 592: that he had only one stanza short, that on "the sign on the apricot tree
LINE 593: is visible," she consequently bade him copy out clean the first three
LINE 594: odes, while she herself composed a stanza, which she noted down on a
LINE 595: slip of paper, rumpled up into a ball, and threw just in front of
LINE 596: Pao-yü.
LINE 597: As soon as Pao-yü opened it and glanced at it, he realised that it was a
LINE 598: hundred times better than his own three stanzas, and transcribing it
LINE 599: without loss of time, in a bold writing, he handed up his compositions.
LINE 600: On perusal, the Chia Consort read what follows. By Pao-yü, on: "A
LINE 601: phoenix comes with dignified air:"
LINE 602: The bamboos just now don that jadelike grace,
LINE 603: Which worthy makes them the pheasant to face;
LINE 604: Each culm so tender as if to droop fain,
LINE 605: Each one so verdant, in aspect so cool,
LINE 606: The curb protects, from the steps wards the pool.
LINE 607: The pervious screens the tripod smell restrain.
LINE 608: The shadow will be strewn, mind do not shake
LINE 609: And (Hsieh) from her now long fine dream (awake)!
LINE 610: On "the pure fragrance of the Ligularia and Iris Florentina:"
LINE 611: Hengs and Wus the still park permeate;
LINE 612: The los and pis their sweet perfume enhance;
LINE 613: And supple charms the third spring flowers ornate;
LINE 614: Softly is wafted one streak of fragrance!
LINE 615: A light mist doth becloud the tortuous way!
LINE 616: With moist the clothes bedews, that verdure cold!
LINE 617: The pond who ever sinuous could hold?
LINE 618: Dreams long and subtle, dream the household Hsieh.
LINE 619: On "the happy red and joyful green:"
LINE 620: Stillness pervades the deep pavilion on a lengthy day.
LINE 621: The green and red, together matched, transcendent grace display.
LINE 622: Unfurled do still remain in spring the green and waxlike leaves.
LINE 623: No sleep yet seeks the red-clad maid, though night's hours be
LINE 624: far-spent,
LINE 625: But o'er the rails lo, she reclines, dangling her ruddy sleeves;
LINE 626: Against the stone she leans shrouded by taintless scent,
LINE 627: And stands the quarter facing whence doth blow the eastern wind!
LINE 628: Her lord and master must look up to her with feelings kind.
LINE 629: On "the sign on the apricot tree is visible:"
LINE 630: The apricot tree sign to drink wayfarers doth invite;
LINE 631: A farm located on a hill, lo! yonder strikes the sight!
LINE 632: And water caltrops, golden lotus, geese, as well as flows,
LINE 633: And mulberry and elm trees which afford rest to swallows.
LINE 634: That wide extent of spring leeks with verdure covers the ground;
LINE 635: And o'er ten li the paddy blossom fragrance doth abound.
LINE 636: In days of plenty there's a lack of dearth and of distress,
LINE 637: And what need then is there to plough and weave with such briskness?
LINE 638: When the Chia consort had done with the perusal, excessive joy filled
LINE 639: her heart. "He has indeed made progress!" she exclaimed, and went on to
LINE 640: point at the verses on "the sign on the apricot tree," as being the
LINE 641: crowning piece of the four stanzas. In due course, she with her own
LINE 642: hands changed the motto "a cottage in the hills where dolichos is
LINE 643: bleached" into "the paddy-scented village;" and bidding also T'an Ch'un
LINE 644: to take the several tens of stanzas written then, and to transcribe them
LINE 645: separately on ornamented silk paper, she commanded a eunuch to send them
LINE 646: to the outer quarters. And when Chia Cheng and the other men perused
LINE 647: them, one and all sung their incessant praise, while Chia Cheng, on his
LINE 648: part, sent in some complimentary message, with regard to her return home
LINE 649: on a visit.
LINE 650: Yuan Ch'un went further and gave orders that luscious wines, a ham and
LINE 651: other such presents should be conferred upon Pao-yü, as well as upon
LINE 652: Chia Lan. This Chia Lan was as yet at this time a perfect youth without
LINE 653: any knowledge of things in general, so that all that he could do was to
LINE 654: follow the example of his mother, and imitate his uncle in performing
LINE 655: the conventional rites.
LINE 656: At the very moment that Chia Se felt unable, along with a company of
LINE 657: actresses, to bear the ordeal of waiting on the ground floor of the
LINE 658: two-storied building, he caught sight of a eunuch come running at a
LINE 659: flying pace. "The composition of verses is over," he said, "so quick
LINE 660: give me the programme;" whereupon Chia Se hastened to present the
LINE 661: programme as well as a roll of the names of the twelve girls. And not a
LINE 662: long interval elapsed before four plays were chosen; No. 1 being the
LINE 663: Imperial Banquet; No. 2 Begging (the weaver goddess) for skill in
LINE 664: needlework; No. 3 The spiritual match; and No. 4 the Parting spirit.
LINE 665: Chia Se speedily lent a hand in the getting up, and the preparations for
LINE 666: the performance, and each of the girls sang with a voice sufficient to
LINE 667: split the stones and danced in the manner of heavenly spirits; and
LINE 668: though their exterior was that of the characters in which they were
LINE 669: dressed up for the play, their acting nevertheless represented, in a
LINE 670: perfect manner, both sorrow as well as joy. As soon as the performance
LINE 671: was brought to a close, a eunuch walked in holding a golden salver
LINE 672: containing cakes, sweets, and the like, and inquired who was Ling Kuan;
LINE 673: and Chia Se readily concluding that these articles were presents
LINE 674: bestowed upon Ling Kuan, made haste to take them over, as he bade Ling
LINE 675: Kuan prostrate herself.
LINE 676: "The honourable consort," the eunuch further added, "directs that Ling
LINE 677: Kuan, who is the best actress of the lot, should sing two more songs;
LINE 678: any two will do, she does not mind what they are."
LINE 679: Chia Se at once expressed his obedience, and felt constrained to urge
LINE 680: Ling Kuan to sing the two ballads entitled: "The walk through the
LINE 681: garden" and "Frightened out of a dream." But Ling Kuan asserted that
LINE 682: these two ballads had not originally been intended for her own role; and
LINE 683: being firm in her refusal to accede and insisting upon rendering the two
LINE 684: songs "The Mutual Promise" and "The Mutual Abuse," Chia Se found it hard
LINE 685: to bring her round, and had no help but to let her have her own way. The
LINE 686: Chia consort was so extremely enchanted with her that she gave
LINE 687: directions that she should not be treated harshly, and that this girl
LINE 688: should receive a careful training, while besides the fixed number of
LINE 689: presents, she gave her two rolls of palace silk, two purses, gold and
LINE 690: silver ingots, and presents in the way of eatables.
LINE 691: Subsequently, when the banquet had been cleared, and she once more
LINE 692: prosecuted her visit through those places to which she had not been, she
LINE 693: quite accidentally espied the Buddhist Temple encircled by hills, and
LINE 694: promptly rinsing her hands, she walked in and burnt incense and
LINE 695: worshipped Buddha. She also composed the device for a tablet, "a humane
LINE 696: boat on the (world's) bitter sea," and went likewise so far as to show
LINE 697: special acts of additional grace to a company of ascetic nuns and Taoist
LINE 698: priestesses.
LINE 699: A eunuch came in a short while and reverently fell on his knees. "The
LINE 700: presents are all in readiness," he reported, "and may it please you to
LINE 701: inspect them and to distribute them, in compliance with custom;" and
LINE 702: presented to her a list, which the Chia consort perused from the very
LINE 703: top throughout without raising any objection, and readily commanding
LINE 704: that action should be taken according to the list, a eunuch descended
LINE 705: and issued the gifts one after another. The presents for dowager lady
LINE 706: Chia consisted, it may be added, of two sceptres, one of gold, the other
LINE 707: of jade, with "may your wishes be fulfilled" inscribed on them; a staff
LINE 708: made of lign-aloes; a string of chaplet beads of Chia-nan fragrant wood;
LINE 709: four rolls of imperial satins with words "Affluence and honours" and
LINE 710: Perennial Spring (woven in them); four rolls of imperial silk with
LINE 711: Perennial Happiness and Longevity; two shoes of purple gold bullion,
LINE 712: representing a pen, an ingot and "as you like;" and ten silver ingots
LINE 713: with the device "Felicitous Blessings." While the two shares for madame
LINE 714: Hsing and madame Wang were only short of hers by the sceptres and
LINE 715: staffs, four things in all. Chia She, Chia Cheng and the others had each
LINE 716: apportioned to him a work newly written by the Emperor, two boxes of
LINE 717: superior ink, and gold and silver cups, two pairs of each; their other
LINE 718: gifts being identical with those above. Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yü, all the
LINE 719: sisters and the rest were assigned each a copy of a new book, a fine
LINE 720: slab and two pair of gold and silver ornaments of a novel kind and
LINE 721: original shape; Pao-yü likewise receiving the same presents. Chia Lan's
LINE 722: gifts consisted of two necklets, one of gold, the other of silver, and
LINE 723: of two pair of gold ingots. Mrs. Yu, widow Li Wan, lady Feng and the
LINE 724: others had each of them, four ingots of gold and silver; and, in the way
LINE 725: of keepsakes, four pieces of silk. There were, in addition, presents
LINE 726: consisting of twenty-four pieces of silk and a thousand strings of good
LINE 727: cash to be allotted to the nurses, and waiting-maids, in the apartments
LINE 728: of dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and of the respective sisters; while
LINE 729: Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Huan, Chia Jung and the rest had, every one,
LINE 730: for presents, a piece of silk, and a pair of gold and silver ingots.
LINE 731: As regards the other gifts, there were a hundred rolls of various
LINE 732: coloured silks, a thousand ounces of pure silver, and several bottles of
LINE 733: imperial wine, intended to be bestowed upon all the men-servants of the
LINE 734: mansions, on the East and the West, as well as upon those who had been
LINE 735: in the garden overseeing works, arranging the decorations, and in
LINE 736: waiting to answer calls, and upon those who looked after the theatres
LINE 737: and managed the lanterns. There being, besides, five hundred strings of
LINE 738: pure cash for the cooks, waiters, jugglers and hundreds of actors and
LINE 739: every kind of domestic.
LINE 740: The whole party had finished giving expression to their thanks for her
LINE 741: bounty, when the managers and eunuchs respectfully announced: "It is
LINE 742: already a quarter to three, and may it please your Majesty to turn back
LINE 743: your imperial chariot;" whereupon, much against her will, the Chia
LINE 744: consort's eyes brimmed over, and she once more gave vent to tears.
